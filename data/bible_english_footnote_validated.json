  "1":"The first name and the last name (Rev. 22:21) in the New Testament is Jesus, proving that Jesus Christ is the subject and content of the New Testament. <br><br>   The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living person, the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ. The Old Testament gives a portrait, in types and prophecies, of this wonderful person as the Coming One. Now, in the New Testament, this wonderful person has come. The first page of the New Testament, in recommending this wonderful person to us, gives us His genealogy. This genealogy can be considered an abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ. To understand the genealogy in Matthew, we need to trace the origin and history of every incident. <br><br>   Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark's account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God's people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning. <br><br>   The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham's descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God's kingdom is not built with the created race of Adam but with the called race of Abraham, which includes both the real Israelites (Rom. 9:6-8) and the believers in Christ (Gal. 3:7, 9, 29). To prove by relating His genealogy that Jesus is a proper man qualified to be the Savior of mankind, Luke traces His genealogy back to Adam, the first generation of mankind. ",
  "2":"In the genealogy of Jesus given by Luke, which proves that He is a proper man, the title Christ is not mentioned (Luke 3:23-38). But in the genealogy of Christ given here by Matthew, which proves that He is the King, the Christ of God, the title Christ is emphasized repeatedly (vv. 1, 16-17). ",
  "3":"Solomon is a type of Christ as the son of David, the One who inherits the throne and kingdom of David (2 Sam. 7:12-13; Luke 1:32-33). Solomon, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he built the temple of God in the kingdom (1 Kings 6:2) and spoke the word of wisdom (1 Kings 10:23-24; Matt. 12:42). Christ, in fulfilling this type, is now building the real temple of God, the church, in the kingdom of God and has spoken the word of wisdom. ",
  "4":"Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18; Gal. 3:16, 14). Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death (Gen. 22:9-10; Heb. 11:19), and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife (Gen. 24:61-67). Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles. ",
  "5":"Abraham begot eight sons (Gen. 16:15; 21:2-3; 25:2). Among those eight, only Isaac is counted as the promised seed (Rom. 9:7-8). Hence, Christ is his descendant to fulfill God's promise given to Abraham and to him (Gen. 22:18; 26:4). ",
  "6":"Isaac begot twin sons, Esau and Jacob (Gen. 25:21-26), but only Jacob was chosen by God (Rom. 9:10-13). Hence, Christ is his descendant to fulfill God's promise given to Abraham, to Isaac, and to him (Gen. 22:18; 26:4; 28:14). ",
  "7":"The birthright of the promised seed consists of the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, as the firstborn son of Jacob, should have inherited the birthright. But because of his defilement he lost the birthright (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1-2). The double portion of the land went to Joseph through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (Josh. 16--17); the priesthood went to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10); and the kingship was given to Judah (Gen. 49:10; 1 Chron. 5:2). Hence, Christ, the King of God's kingdom, is a descendant of Judah (Heb. 7:14); as such, He inherits the kingdom. ",
  "8":"Neither the brothers of Isaac nor the brother of Jacob, but only the brothers of Judah, are mentioned in this genealogy, because only Judah's brothers were chosen by God. ",
  "9":"Pharez and Zarah were twins. At the time of delivery Zarah put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn. However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn (Gen. 38:27-30). Pharez was not chosen by man but was sent by God, proving that it was not by man's choice but by God's. ",
  "10":"In the genealogy of Adam no woman is recorded (Gen. 5:1-32), but in this genealogy of Christ five women are mentioned. Only one of these five was a chaste virgin &#151; Mary, a descendant of the chosen race. Of her, Christ was directly born (v. 16). Among the rest &#151; Tamar, Rahab, Ruth (v. 5), and Bathsheba, who had been the wife of Uriah (v. 6) &#151; some were Gentiles, some were remarried, and three were even sinful &#151; Tamar committed incest, Rahab was a prostitute, and Bathsheba committed adultery. This indicates that Christ is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles, even to the sinful people, and is the kingly Savior of typical sinners. Tamar was Judah's daughter-in-law. Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of her by incest (Gen. 38:6-30). What an evil! ",
  "11":"Rahab was a prostitute in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), a place cursed by God for eternity (Josh. 6:26). After she turned to God and God's people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31) and married Salmon, a leader of Judah, the leading tribe (1 Chron. 2:10-11), she brought forth Boaz, a godly man, out of whom Christ came. Regardless of our background, if we turn to God and His people and are joined to the proper person among God's people, we will bring forth proper fruit and participate in the enjoyment of the birthright of Christ. ",
  "12":"Boaz redeemed his kinsman's inheritance and married the man's widow (Ruth 4:1-17). By so doing he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ. ",
  "13":"The origin of Ruth was incest, for she belonged to the tribe of Moab (Ruth 1:4), the fruit of Lot's incestuous union with his daughter (Gen. 19:30-38). Deuteronomy 23:3 forbade the Moabites to enter the assembly of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation. Ruth, however, not only was accepted by the Lord but also became one of the most important ancestors of Christ because she sought God and God's people (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11-12). Regardless of who we are and what our background is, as long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ. <br><br>   Boaz's mother, Rahab, was a Canaanitess and a prostitute, and his wife, Ruth, was a Moabitess of incestuous origin and a widow. Both were Gentiles and of low class, yet they are associated with Christ. Christ is joined not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles, even to those of low estate. ",
  "14":"Isaiah 11:1 prophesied that Christ would be \"a twig (lit.) out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch ... out of his roots.\" Christ came out of Jesse. However, Isa. 11:10 says that Christ is the root of Jesse, indicating that Jesse came out of Christ. Jesse was one who brought forth Christ, one who branched out Christ by being rooted in Christ. ",
  "15":"David was the eighth son of his father and was chosen and anointed by God (1 Sam. 16:10-13). The number eight signifies resurrection. That David as the eighth son was chosen by God indicates that his association with Christ was in resurrection. Furthermore, he was a man after the heart of God (1 Sam. 13:14) and brought in God's kingdom for Christ. <br><br>   David was the last of the generations of the fathers. He was also the first of the generations of the kings. He was the conclusion of one age and the beginning of the next. He became the landmark of two ages because he brought in the kingdom of God and was closely associated with Christ. ",
  "16":"In this genealogy, only David is called \"the king\" because it was through him that the kingdom with the kingship was brought in. ",
  "17":"When David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God had sent purposely to condemn him (2 Sam. 12:1-12). When David was condemned, he repented. Psalm 51 is the record of his repentance. He repented and God forgave him (2 Sam. 12:13). Then he begot Solomon (2 Sam. 12:24). Hence, Solomon is the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness. <br><br>   The genealogy in Matthew says that David begot Solomon, but the genealogy in Luke says that Nathan was the son of David (Luke 3:31). First Chronicles 3:5 tells us that Nathan and Solomon were two different persons. Luke's record is the genealogy of David's son Nathan, who was Mary's forefather, whereas Matthew's record is the genealogy of David's son Solomon, who was Joseph's forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the line of the wife; the other is the line of Joseph, the line of the husband. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David. Under God's sovereignty they were joined together by marriage, so that through Mary, Joseph was indirectly associated with Christ. Christ can be counted as a descendant of David through either Solomon or Nathan. Hence, He has two genealogies. <br><br>   Strictly, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect, through the marriage of Joseph, his descendant, to Mary, of whom Christ was born (v. 16). The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon's descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be a descendant of David (2 Sam. 7:13-14; Jer. 23:5). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ as a descendant of David were nevertheless fulfilled. ",
  "18":"Uriah was a Hittite, a heathen, and his wife was Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11:3). David murdered him and took Bathsheba. Hence, she was remarried as a result of murder and adultery (2 Sam. 11:26-27). David, a man after the heart of God, did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one evil (1 Kings 15:5). This genealogy does not say \"of Bathsheba\" but \"of her who had been the wife of Uriah,\" to emphasize this great sin of David's, thus showing that Christ as the kingly Savior is related not only to the heathen but also to sinners. ",
  "19":"Beginning with Rehoboam, the kingdom of David was divided (1 Kings 11:9-12; 12:1-17). Of the twelve tribes, one was kept for David's sake (1 Kings 11:13), that is, for Christ. Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David, because He had to be born as an heir to David's throne. <br><br>   After being divided, the kingdom of David was in two parts. The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel (a universal name) and was composed of ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah (a local name) and was composed of two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, not one of the names of the kings of Israel was included in the genealogy of Christ. The kings of Israel were excluded because they were not associated with Christ. They were for something other than Christ. ",
  "20":"The genealogy here records that \"Joram begot Uzziah.\" However, 1 Chron. 3:11-12 says, \"Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah\" (who is Uzziah &#151; 2 Kings 15:1, 13). Three generations &#151; Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah &#151; were omitted. This must have been because of the evil marriage of Joram and the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, which corrupted Joram's descendants (2 Chron. 21:5-6; 22:1-4). In accordance with Exo. 20:5, three generations of Joram's descendants were cut off from the genealogy of Christ. ",
  "21":"The genealogy here records that \"Josiah begot Jeconiah.\" However, 1 Chron. 3:15-16 says, \"The sons of Josiah ... the second Jehoiakim ... and the sons of Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son.\" One generation &#151; Jehoiakim &#151; was omitted from the genealogy of Christ. This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected taxes for Pharaoh (2 Kings 23:34-35). ",
  "22":"Jeconiah was not reckoned a king in the genealogy, because he was born during the captivity and was a captive (2 Chron. 36:9-10 &#151; Jehoiachin is Jeconiah). According to the prophecy in Jer. 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would inherit the throne of David. If Christ had been a direct descendant of Jeconiah, He would not have been entitled to the throne of David. Although Jer. 22:28-30 says that all the descendants of Jeconiah are excluded from the throne of David, Jer. 23:5 says that God would raise up a Shoot to David, a King who would reign and prosper. This Shoot is Christ. This prophecy confirms that Christ would be the descendant of David, although not a direct descendant of Jeconiah, and would inherit the throne of David. ",
  "23":"In this genealogy there is no mention of the brothers of any kings. However, here the brothers of Jeconiah are mentioned, proving that Jeconiah was not reckoned a king in this genealogy of Christ. ",
  "24":"Referring to the carrying away of the children of Israel into captivity in Babylon. So in v. 17. ",
  "25":"Even those who were carried away as captives to Babylon were included in this sacred record of Christ's genealogy because they had an indirect relationship with Christ through Mary, the wife of one of their descendants and the mother of Jesus. ",
  "26":"\"Jeconiah begot Salathiel, and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.\" Compare this record with 1 Chron. 3:17-19, which says, \"The sons of Jeconiah ... Salathiel ... and Pedaiah ... and the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel,\" showing that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, Salathiel's brother. Zerubbabel was not Salathiel's son but was his nephew, and he became his heir. Perhaps this was a case in accordance with Deut. 25:5-6. Even that word in Deuteronomy is related to the genealogy of Christ. <br><br>   Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon (Ezra 5:1-2). He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God's temple (Zech. 4:7-10). The Old Testament predicted that Christ, as a descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2; Matt. 2:4-6). Without the return from captivity, it would not have been possible for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. God's command that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple of God but also to prepare for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. Christ needed some people to be in the proper place to bring Him to earth the first time. Similarly, for His second coming Christ needs some of His people to return from their captivity to the proper church life. ",
  "27":"Here the genealogy says that \"Jacob begot Joseph,\" but Luke 3:23 says, \"Joseph, the son of Heli.\" Luke's record was \"according to law\" (a literal translation of \"so it was thought\" in Luke 3:23), indicating that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli but was reckoned his son according to the law. Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary's father. This may be a case according to Num. 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, the inheritance would go to the daughters, who would then have to marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe. Even such a regulation in the Old Testament is related to the genealogy of Christ, showing that all Scripture is a record of Christ. ",
  "28":"At this point the record of this genealogy does not say, \"Joseph begot Jesus,\" which is similar to what is said of all the foregoing persons; it says, \"Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus.\" Jesus was born of Mary, and not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of the woman and would be born of a virgin (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14). Christ could not have been born of Joseph because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, none of whose descendants could inherit the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). However, Mary was a virgin and a descendant of David (Luke 1:27, 31-32); as such, she was the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph and Mary brought Joseph into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ's genealogy for the bringing in of Christ, as shown in the chart on the following page. <br><br>   This chart shows that the generation of Jesus Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, and on to David. After David it divides into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary and Joseph, to bring in Jesus Christ. In this way Christ was apparently a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family; actually, He was not a descendant of Jeconiah, Joseph's forefather, but a descendant of David, Mary's forefather, so that He could qualify to inherit the throne of David. ",
  "29":"This genealogy first mentions four women who were either remarried or sinful. In addition, here it mentions a chaste virgin. This indicates that all the persons named in this genealogy were born in sin, except Christ, who was born in holiness. <br><br>   Abraham, David, and Mary were the three persons crucial to the bringing in of Christ. Abraham represents a life by faith; David, a life under the dealing of the cross; and Mary, a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. It was through these three kinds of lives that Christ was brought forth into humanity. ",
  "30":"Christ is emphasized here to prove that Jesus is the very Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. ",
  "31":"This genealogy is divided into three ages: (1) from Abraham until David, fourteen generations, the age before the establishing of the kingdom; (2) from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, the age of the kingdom; (3) from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, again fourteen generations, the age after the fall of the kingdom. According to history, there were actually forty-five generations. By deducting from these generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and then adding one by making David two generations (one, the age before the establishing of the kingdom, and the other, the age of the kingdom), the generations total forty-two, being divided into three ages of fourteen generations each. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies creatures (Rev. 4:6); ten signifies fullness (25:1). Hence, fourteen signifies the creatures in full. Fourteen generations being multiplied by three indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full. <br><br>   This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, which includes the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father corresponds with the section of the fathers, God the Son with the section of the kings, and God the Spirit with the section of the civilians. This too indicates the mingling of the Triune God with His human creatures. <br><br>   Three times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number for trials, temptations, and sufferings (Heb. 3:9; Matt. 4:2; 1 Kings 19:8). Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trial. The children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they entered the good land of rest. The millennial kingdom as a rest will come after the forty-two months of the great tribulation (Rev. 13:5). After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction. ",
  "32":"David is the end of the generations of the fathers and the beginning of the generations of the kings. He was the one person used by God as a landmark to conclude the section of the fathers and to begin the section of the kings. ",
  "33":"At the time of degradation no person was there as a landmark to demarcate the generations as did Abraham and David. Thus, the deportation became a landmark, a landmark of shame. ",
  "34":"Luke's record begins with Jesus and traces back to God. Matthew's record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed to Christ and brought in Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come! ",
  "35":"Lit., out of. Although Christ was born of Mary (v. 16), He was a child of the Holy Spirit. The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit (v. 20). His source was the Holy Spirit and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking the likeness of the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7). ",
  "36":"A righteous man at that time was one walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord (Luke 1:6), i.e., one who was living according to the law of God with the propitiation made by the offerings. ",
  "37":"Lit., release her. ",
  "38":"God was first born into Mary through His Spirit; after the conception was completed, He, with the human nature, was born to be a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity. This is the origin of Christ. ",
  "39":"Lit., out of. ",
  "40":"Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (Heb. 4:8; Matt. 11:28-29), which is Himself as the good land to us. ",
  "41":"One who is commonly considered a foreteller. But in the Scriptures a prophet is one who speaks for God, speaks forth God, and predicts. ",
  "42":"This son of the virgin is the seed of the woman prophesied in Gen. 3:15. ",
  "43":"Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel, meaning God with us, was the name by which man called Him. Jesus the Savior is God with us. He is God, and He is also God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but God with us. ",
  "44":"Christ as the very Emmanuel not only was with us when He was on earth, but also is with us, since His ascension, whenever we are gathered into His name (18:20). Moreover, He will be with us all the days until the consummation of the age (28:20). ",
  "45":"The birth of Christ was prepared and accomplished by God's sovereignty. By His sovereignty God brought back to Judea from the captivity in Babylon the ancestors of both Joseph and Mary under the leadership of their forefather Zerubbabel (v. 12; Ezra 5:1-2). Again by His sovereignty God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). Even more, by His sovereignty God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage so that Christ could be brought in as the legal heir to the throne of David. ",
  "46":"Meaning house of bread. ",
  "47":"Luke's record concerning the youth of Jesus proves that He is a proper man (Luke 2:15-52), whereas Matthew's record, very different from Luke's, testifies that Christ is the proper King, the Christ prophesied in the Scriptures. ",
  "48":"The Jews had the Scriptures concerning Christ. The magi from the east saw Christ's star (Num. 24:17). The Jews had mental knowledge in dead letters concerning Christ, whereas the magi received a living vision concerning Him. After receiving the living vision, the magi were misled by their human concept and went to Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation, where its king was presumed to be. Their being misled caused many young boys to be killed (v. 16). After the magi were corrected by the Scriptures (vv. 4-6), they went to Bethlehem (vv. 8-9), and the star appeared to them again and led them to the place where Christ was (vv. 9-10). ",
  "49":"The priests were those who taught people the law (Mal. 2:7), and the scribes were those who knew the Scriptures (Ezra 7:6). Both the priests and the scribes had knowledge concerning the birth of Christ (vv. 5-6), but, unlike the magi from the east, they did not see the vision, nor did they have the heart to seek after Christ. ",
  "50":"Signifying cities. ",
  "51":"When the magi were corrected by the Scriptures and restored to the right track, the star appeared to them again. Living vision always accompanies the Scriptures. ",
  "52":"The shepherds found the baby Jesus still in a manger (Luke 2:16); after this, the magi from the east saw the child in the house. ",
  "53":"They worshipped Him as they would worship God (4:10). ",
  "54":"The gifts offered to Christ by the magi were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. In figure, gold signifies the divine nature; frankincense, the fragrance of resurrection; and myrrh, the fragrance of death. The offering of these gifts by the magi was undoubtedly under the inspiration of God's Spirit, to indicate the worth of Christ's divine nature and the preciousness of His resurrection and death. In the four Gospels, which are the biographies of Jesus, the things signified by these treasures are seen throughout Jesus' life. Moreover, these precious treasures offered by the magi might have provided for the Lord's journeys from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth. ",
  "55":"Lit., turn back. ",
  "56":"Once we have seen Christ, we never take the same way but always take another way. ",
  "57":"This fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in Hosea 11:1 was carried out by God through the magi's mistake in going to Jerusalem. God is sovereign, even over our mistakes. ",
  "58":"This prophecy joins Christ to Israel. ",
  "59":"This was the first martyrdom in the New Testament related to Christ. ",
  "60":"Rachel was buried on the way to Bethlehem (Gen. 35:19; 48:7). Ramah, located in the territory of Benjamin (Josh. 18:21-28), the son of Rachel (Gen. 35:15-18), was not far from the site of Rachel's tomb. The young boys killed by Herod are considered the children of Rachel in this poetic prophecy. ",
  "61":"Lit., soul. ",
  "62":"Galilee was of the Gentiles (4:15) and was despised by the people (John 7:41, 52). Christ was born in honored Judea but was raised in despised Galilee. ",
  "63":"Under God's sovereign arrangement Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire (Luke 2:1-3). It was through that census that Christ was born in Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) to fulfill the prophecy concerning His birth (Micah 5:2). He stayed there a short time. Then, because of Herod's persecution He was taken to Egypt (vv. 13-15), and subsequently He was brought back to the land of Israel (vv. 19-21). Because of Archelaus's reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, Christ was brought to Nazareth, a despised city of Galilee (vv. 22-23; John 1:45-46), and was raised there. He was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem but grew up in the despised city of Nazareth. Hence, He was called a Nazarene. To follow Christ requires that we heed not only the Scriptures concerning Him but also the instant leadings, such as those Joseph had in his dreams. Caring only for the Scriptures while neglecting the instant leadings may cause us to miss Christ, as did the Jewish priests and scribes. Heeding the instant leadings requires a seeking heart. ",
  "64":"See note 22 in ch. 1. ",
  "65":"The word prophets, in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy but a summary of the significance of several prophecies, such as the one in Psa. 22:6-7. The title Nazarene may refer to the Branch in Isa. 11:1, which in Hebrew is netzer. The Branch there, signifying Christ, is a twig out of the stem of Jesse, the father of David. By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off. Now a new twig sprouted from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. The sprouting and growing of this twig were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem. Rather, He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, a Branch &#151; not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant twig from the stump of Jesse. ",
  "66":"The dispensation of law was terminated by the coming of John the Baptist (11:13; Luke 16:16). After the baptism by John, the preaching of the gospel of peace began (Acts 10:36-37). John's preaching was the beginning of the gospel (Mark 1:1-5). Hence, the dispensation of grace began with John. ",
  "67":"John the Baptist's preaching was the initiation of God's New Testament economy. He did this preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, in a \"wild\" way, not keeping any old regulations. This indicates that the old way of worshipping God according to the Old Testament had been repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in. Wilderness here indicates that the new way of God's New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It indicates further that nothing old was left and that something new was going to be built up. ",
  "68":"To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose. ",
  "69":"In John the Baptist's preaching, repentance, as the opening of God's New Testament economy, involved making a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God's New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. For this we should repent, change our mind, make a turn in our life-pursuit. The goal of our pursuing has been other things; now our pursuing must turn toward God and His kingdom, which in Matthew (cf. Mark 1:15) is specifically and purposefully called \"the kingdom of the heavens.\" According to the Gospel of Matthew as a whole, the kingdom of the heavens is different from the Messianic kingdom. The Messianic kingdom will be the restored kingdom of David (the rebuilt tabernacle of David &#151; Acts 15:16), made up of the children of Israel, and will be earthly and physical in nature; whereas the kingdom of the heavens is constituted of regenerated believers and is heavenly and spiritual. (See note 3 in ch. 5.) ",
  "70":"This clearly indicates that before the coming of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not there. Even after his appearing, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near. At the time the Lord began His ministry, and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach, the kingdom of the heavens had still not come (4:17; 10:7). Hence, in the first parable in ch. 13, the parable of the seed (13:3-9), which indicates the Lord's preaching, the Lord did not say, \"The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like ... \" Not until the second parable, the parable of the tares (13:24), which indicates the establishing of the church on the day of Pentecost, did the Lord say this. Matthew 16:18-19, in which the terms church and kingdom of the heavens are used interchangeably, proves that the kingdom of the heavens came when the church was established. ",
  "71":"It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness. This indicates that John's introducing of God's New Testament economy was not accidental but had been planned by God and foretold by Him through Isaiah the prophet. This implies that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way. ",
  "72":"The way, similar to a street, and the paths, similar to lanes, are a portrait of man's heart with all its parts. To repent unto the Lord with our whole being and with our whole heart and to let the Lord come in is to prepare the way of the Lord. To allow the Lord to further occupy every part of our heart, including the mind, the emotion, and the will, is to make straight the paths of the Lord. Hence, to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight is to change our mind, to turn our mind toward the Lord and make our heart right, that through repentance every part and avenue of our heart may be straightened by the Lord for the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 1:16-17). ",
  "73":"John was born a priest (Luke 1:5, 13). According to the regulations of the law, he should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen (Exo. 28:4, 40-41; Lev. 6:10; Ezek. 44:17-18), and he should have eaten the priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (Lev. 2:1-3; 6:16-18, 25-26; 7:31-34). However, John did altogether differently. He wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle, and he ate locusts and wild honey. All these things were uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to the religious regulations. For a priestly person to wear camel's hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was considered unclean according to the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11:4). In addition, John did not live in a civilized place but in the wilderness (Luke 3:2). All this indicates that he had wholly abandoned the Old Testament dispensation, which had degraded into a religion mixed with human culture. His intention was to introduce God's New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of life. ",
  "74":"To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them, in water, which signifies death. John the Baptist did this to indicate that he who repents is good for nothing but burial. Further, this signifies that the old person has been terminated so that a new beginning can be realized in resurrection, to be brought in by Christ as the Life-giver. Hence, after John's ministry, Christ came. John's baptism not only terminated those who repented but also ushered them to Christ for life. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into water is to be put into death and buried. To be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death. ",
  "75":"The Jordan River was the water in which twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, were buried and from which another twelve stones, again representing the twelve tribes of Israel, were resurrected and brought up (Josh. 4:1-18). Hence, to baptize people in the Jordan River implied the burial of their old being and the resurrection of the new. Just as the crossing of the Jordan River by the children of Israel ushered them into the good land, so baptism brings people into Christ, the reality of the good land. ",
  "76":"The Pharisees were the strictest religious sect of the Jews (Acts 26:5). This sect was formed about 200 B.C. They were proud of their superior religious living, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures. Actually, they had degraded into pretension and hypocrisy (23:2-33). ",
  "77":"The Sadducees were another sect within Judaism (Acts 5:17). They did not believe in the resurrection, in angels, or in spirits (22:23; Acts 23:8). Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced as a brood of vipers by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus (v. 7; 12:34; 23:33). The Lord Jesus warned His disciples against their doctrines (16:6, 12). The Pharisees were considered orthodox, whereas the Sadducees were the ancient modernists. ",
  "78":"Because of the impenitence of the Jews, both this word and the word in v. 10 have been fulfilled. God has cut off the Jews and has raised up the believing Gentiles to be descendants of Abraham in faith (Rom. 11:15a, 19-20, 22; Gal. 3:7, 28-29). John's word in this verse clearly indicates that the kingdom of the heavens preached by him is constituted not of the children of Abraham by birth but of the children of Abraham by faith; thus, it is a heavenly kingdom, not the earthly kingdom of the Messiah. ",
  "79":"According to the context, the fire here is not the fire in Acts 2:3, which is related to the Holy Spirit, but is the same fire as in vv. 10 and 12, the fire in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15), where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition. John's word spoken here to the Pharisees and Sadducees means that if the Pharisees and Sadducees would genuinely repent and believe in the Lord, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit that they might have eternal life; otherwise, the Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment. John's baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in the Lord. The Lord's baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire. The Lord's baptism in the Holy Spirit initiated the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire. Hence, the Lord's baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is based on His redemption, is the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire, which is based on His judgment, is the ending of that kingdom. Thus, in this verse there are three kinds of baptisms: the baptism in water, the baptism in the Spirit, and the baptism in fire. The baptism in water by John introduced people to the kingdom of the heavens. The baptism in the Spirit by the Lord Jesus commenced and established the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost and will carry it on to its consummation at the end of this age. The baptism in fire by the Lord according to the judgment at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15) will conclude the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "80":"Those typified by the wheat have life within. The Lord will baptize them in the Holy Spirit and, by rapture, gather them into His barn in the air. Those typified by the chaff, like the tares in 13:24-30, are without life. The Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire. The chaff here refers to the impenitent Jews, whereas the tares in ch. 13 refer to the nominal Christians. The eternal destiny of both will be the same &#151; perdition in the lake of fire (13:40-42). ",
  "81":"As a man, the Lord Jesus came to John the Baptist to be baptized according to God's New Testament way. Of the four Gospels, only John's does not give a record of the Lord's baptism, because John testifies that the Lord is God. ",
  "82":"Righteousness is to be right by living, walking, and doing things in the way God has ordained. In the Old Testament, to be righteous was to keep the law that God had given. Now God sent John the Baptist to institute baptism. To be baptized also is to fulfill righteousness before God, that is, to fulfill the requirement of God. The Lord Jesus came to John not as God but as a typical man, a real Israelite. Hence, He had to be baptized in order to keep this dispensational practice of God; otherwise, He would not have been right with God. ",
  "83":"The Lord was baptized not only to fulfill all righteousness according to God's ordination, but also to allow Himself to be put into death and resurrection that He might minister not in a natural way but in the way of resurrection. By being baptized, He was able to live and minister in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later. ",
  "84":"The Lord's being baptized to fulfill God's righteousness and to be put into death and resurrection brought Him three things: the open heavens, the descending Spirit of God, and the speaking of the Father. It is the same with us today. ",
  "85":"Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35). This proves that at the time of His baptism He already had the Spirit of God within Him. The Spirit's being within Him was for His birth. Now for His ministry the Spirit of God descended upon Him. This was the fulfillment of Isa. 61:1; 42:1; and Psa. 45:7, and was carried out to anoint the new King and introduce Him to His people. ",
  "86":"A dove is gentle, and its eyes can see only one thing at a time. Hence, it signifies gentleness and singleness in sight and purpose. By the descending of the Spirit of God like a dove upon Him, the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness, focusing solely on the will of God. ",
  "87":"The Spirit's descending was the anointing of Christ, whereas the Father's speaking was a testimony to Him as the beloved Son. This is a picture of the Divine Trinity: the Son rose up from the water, the Spirit descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke concerning the Son. This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist simultaneously. This is for the accomplishing of God's economy. ",
  "88":"After being baptized in water and anointed with the Spirit of God, Jesus as a man moved according to the leading of the Spirit. This indicates that His kingly ministry in His humanity was according to the Spirit. ",
  "89":"First, the Spirit led the anointed King to be tempted by the devil. This temptation was a test to prove that He was qualified to be the King for the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "90":"The Greek word means accuser, slanderer (Rev. 12:9-10). The devil, Satan, accuses us before God and slanders us before men. ",
  "91":"Forty days and forty nights is a time of testing and suffering (Deut. 9:9, 18; 1 Kings 19:8). The newly anointed King was led by the Spirit to fast for this period of time that He might enter into His kingly ministry. ",
  "92":"The tempter is the devil (v. 1; 1 Thes. 3:5). ",
  "93":"The newly anointed King fasted in His humanity, standing on the ground of man. On the other hand, He was also the Son of God, as God the Father had declared at His baptism (3:17). For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, He had to defeat God's enemy, the devil, Satan. This He had to do as a man. Hence, He stood as a man to confront the enemy of God. The devil, knowing this, tempted Him to leave the standing of man and assume His position as the Son of God. Forty days before, God the Father had declared from the heavens that He was the beloved Son of the Father. The subtle tempter took that declaration of God the Father as the ground from which to tempt Him. If He had assumed His position as the Son of God before the enemy, He would have lost the standing to defeat him. (See note 4.) ",
  "94":"To make the stones become loaves of bread would certainly have been a miracle. This was proposed by the devil as a temptation. Many times the thought of having a miracle performed in certain situations is a temptation from the devil. The devil's temptation of the first man, Adam, concerned the matter of eating (Gen. 3:1-6). His temptation here of the second man, Christ, also concerned the matter of eating. Eating is always a trap used by the devil to ensnare man, causing man to be tempted in a personal way. ",
  "95":"The newly anointed King confronted the enemy's temptation not by His own word but by the word of the Scriptures. ",
  "96":"The tempter tempted the new King to take His position as the Son of God. But He answered with the word of the Scriptures, \"Man ... ,\" indicating that He stood in the position of man to deal with the enemy. The demons address Jesus as the Son of God (8:29), but the evil spirits do not confess that Jesus came in the flesh (1 John 4:3), because in confessing Jesus as a man they admit that they are defeated. Although the demons confess Jesus as the Son of God, the devil will not allow people to believe that He is the Son of God, because in so doing they would be saved (John 20:31). ",
  "97":"This word indicates that the Lord Jesus took the word of God in the Scriptures as His bread and lived on it. ",
  "98":"Gk. rhema, the instant word, differing from logos, the constant word. In this temptation all the words quoted by the Lord from Deuteronomy were logos, the constant word in the Scriptures. But when He quoted them, they became rhema, the instant word applied to His situation. ",
  "99":"All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Hence, the words in the Scriptures are the words that proceed out through the mouth of God. ",
  "100":"The protruding parts, resembling wings, on the left and right sides of the temple's front portico; these parts were more elevated than the temple itself. ",
  "101":"The devil's first temptation of the new King was regarding the matter of human living. Defeated in this, he turned in his second temptation to religion, tempting the new King to demonstrate that He was the Son of God by casting Himself down from the wing of the temple. ",
  "102":"There was no need for the Lord Jesus to do this. It was simply a temptation enticing Him to show that as the Son of God He was able to act miraculously. Any thought of doing miraculous things in religion is a temptation of the devil. ",
  "103":"Because the Lord Jesus had defeated him by quoting the Scriptures, the tempter imitated His way and tempted Him by quoting the Scriptures, albeit in a subtle way. ",
  "104":"To quote the Scriptures concerning one aspect of something requires us to take into account the other aspects as well, in order to be safeguarded from the deception of the tempter. This was what the new King did here to counter the tempter's second temptation. Many times we need to tell the tempter, \"Again, it is written.\" ",
  "105":"The Greek word means try exceedingly, test thoroughly. ",
  "106":"Defeated in his temptation in the religious sphere, the devil presented his third temptation to the new King, this time in the realm of the glory of this world. He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. The sequence of the subtle one's temptations &#151; first, in regard to human living; second, in regard to religion; and third, in regard to worldly glory &#151; is especially seductive in relation to the practical affairs of human life. ",
  "107":"Luke 4:6 says that the kingdoms of the world and their glory were delivered to the devil; hence, to whomever he wills he gives them. Before his fall, Satan as the archangel was appointed by God to be the ruler of the world (Ezek. 28:13-14). Hence, he is called \"the ruler of this world\" (John 12:31) and holds all the kingdoms of this world and their glory in his hand. Seeking to be worshipped, he presented all these to tempt the newly anointed King. The heavenly King overcame this temptation, but the coming Antichrist will not (Rev. 13:2, 4). ",
  "108":"Satan, from Hebrew, means adversary. Satan is not only God's enemy outside God's kingdom but also God's adversary within God's kingdom, where he rebels against God. ",
  "109":"The new King rebuked the devil for his presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve only God. To worship or to serve anything other than God for gain is always a temptation from the devil, that he may secure worship. ",
  "110":"The devil's temptation of the first man, Adam, was a success; his temptation of the second man, Christ, was an absolute failure. This indicates that he will have no place in the new King's kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "111":"The angels came and ministered to the tempted King, who was here a suffering man (cf. Luke 22:43). ",
  "112":"John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city; still, his ministry was in Judea, not far from the \"holy\" things. Because of the people's rejection of John, the Lord Jesus withdrew into Galilee to begin His ministry, far away from the holy temple and the holy city. This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy in Isa. 9:1-2. ",
  "113":"Galilee was a place with a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. Hence, it was called \"Galilee of the Gentiles\" and was despised by the orthodox Jews (John 7:41, 52). The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry for the kingdom of the heavens in such a despised place, far from the capital of the country, dignified Jerusalem, with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion. This implied that the ministry of the newly anointed King was for a heavenly kingdom that was different from the earthly kingdom of David (the Messianic kingdom). ",
  "114":"The new King's ministry for the kingdom of the heavens began not with earthly power but with heavenly light, which was the King Himself as the light of life shining in the shadow of death. ",
  "115":"The new King continued the preaching of His forerunner, John the Baptist (3:2). ",
  "116":"The new King's ministry was not in the capital but beside the sea. His forerunner's ministry began by the riverside and consisted of burying the religious and terminating their religion. The new King's ministry began by the seashore and consisted of catching men who were not very religious, men who lived around the sea instead of in the holy place, and making them fishers of men for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "117":"When Peter and Andrew were called by the Lord, they were casting a net into the sea. They were made fishers of men (v. 19). Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:37-42; 4:4). ",
  "118":"Lit., arc-shaped net. ",
  "119":"Prior to this time, in the place where John had preached, Andrew, one of the two disciples there of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord (John 1:35-36, 40-42). That was the first time Andrew and Peter had met the Lord. Here the Lord met them the second time, this time at the Sea of Galilee. They were attracted by the Lord as the great light shining in the darkness of death and followed Him for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens in the light of life. ",
  "120":"When James and John were called by the Lord, they were in a boat, mending their nets. Eventually, John became a real mender, mending the rents in the church by his ministry of life. (See his three Epistles and chs. 2 and 3 of Revelation.) ",
  "121":"One of the two disciples of John the Baptist in John 1:40 was John the apostle. Thus, he must have met the Lord before, in the place where Peter first met the Lord. Here at the Sea of Galilee was the second meeting. Like Peter and Andrew, John and his brother were attracted by the Lord and followed Him. ",
  "122":"A synagogue is a place where the Jews read and learn the Scriptures (Luke 4:16-17; Acts 13:14-15). ",
  "123":"Or, good news, glad tidings. In this book the gospel is called \"the gospel of the kingdom.\" It includes not only forgiveness of sins (cf. Luke 24:47) and the imparting of life (cf. John 20:31) but also the kingdom of the heavens (24:14) with the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5), the power to cast out demons and heal diseases (Isa. 35:5-6; Matt. 10:1). Both forgiveness of sins and the imparting of life are for the kingdom. ",
  "124":"Under the shining of the new King as the great light shining in the darkness, great crowds were attracted to follow Him for the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "125":"A district of ten cities. ",
  "126":"The new King called His followers by the seashore, but to give them the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, He went up to the mountain. This indicates that for the realization of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to go higher with Him. ",
  "127":"When the new King sat down on the mountain, His disciples, not the crowds, came to Him to be His audience. Eventually, not only the believing Jews but also the discipled nations (the Gentiles &#151; 28:19) became His disciples. Later the disciples were called Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, the word the new King spoke on the mountain in chs. 5--7, concerning the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, was spoken to the believers of the New Testament, not to the Jews of the Old Testament. ",
  "128":"The Greek word implies happy. It may also be rendered blessed and happy. So in succeeding verses. The word spoken by the new King, being the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, is a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. It is composed of seven sections. The first section, vv. 3-12, depicts the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens, who are under nine blessings. They are people who are poor in spirit, who mourn for the present situation, who are meek in suffering opposition, who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, who are merciful toward others, who are pure in heart, who make peace, who suffer persecution for righteousness, and who are reproached and evilly spoken of because of the Lord. ",
  "129":"To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "130":"Spirit here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. This implies that the kingdom of the heavens is spiritual, not material. ",
  "131":"Kingdom of the heavens is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God (see chart on pp. 30-31), the latter being mentioned in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God is God's general reign from eternity past to eternity future. It comprises eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the chosen patriarchs (including the paradise of Adam), the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom (including its heavenly part, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and its earthly part, the Messianic kingdom), and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem in eternity without end. The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, a section composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. Hence, in the New Testament, especially in the other three Gospels, the kingdom of the heavens, a section of the kingdom of God, is also called \"the kingdom of God.\" In the Old Testament the kingdom of God, generally, already existed with the nation of Israel (21:43); the kingdom of the heavens, specifically, had still not come, and it only drew near when John the Baptist came (3:1-2; 11:11-12). <br><br>   According to Matthew there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed by the new King on the mountain in chs. 5--7. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed by the King on the seashore in ch. 13. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in chs. 24--25. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in 13:43; the earthly part of the millennial kingdom is the Messianic kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Son of Man in 13:41, and which is the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David (Acts 15:16). In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6); in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the Messianic kingdom on earth, the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests and will teach the nations to worship God (Zech. 8:20-23). <br><br>   If we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours: we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age. ",
  "132":"The entire situation of the world is negative toward God's economy. Satan, sin, self, darkness, and worldliness predominate among all people on earth. God's glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolate, self is corrupt, and the whole world is evil. God wants us to mourn over such a situation. ",
  "133":"If we mourn according to God and His economy, we will be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. We will see God's heavenly ruling over the entire negative situation. ",
  "134":"To be meek means not to resist the world's opposition but to suffer it willingly. ",
  "135":"If we are meek, willing to suffer the world's opposition in this age, we will inherit the earth in the coming age, as revealed in Heb. 2:5-8 and Luke 19:17, 19. ",
  "136":"Righteousness here denotes our being right in our behavior. We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 10, 20). ",
  "137":"If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us the very righteousness we seek, that we may be satisfied. ",
  "138":"To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve. For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be not only righteous but also merciful. ",
  "139":"To receive mercy is to receive what we do not deserve. If we are merciful to others, the Lord will give us mercy (2 Tim. 1:16, 18), especially at His judgment seat (James 2:12-13). ",
  "140":"To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory (1 Cor. 10:31). This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ (John 1:12; 3:6), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (13:19). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. Also, we need to be pure, single, in our heart that Christ may grow in us without frustration. ",
  "141":"If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God. Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart. This blessing is both for today and for the coming age. ",
  "142":"Satan, the rebellious one, is the instigator of all rebellion. For the kingdom of the heavens, under its heavenly ruling, we must be those who make peace among men (Heb. 12:14). ",
  "143":"Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature. As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must walk in His divine life and according to His divine nature. In this way we will express His life and nature and be called the sons of God. ",
  "144":"The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness. If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. For the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to pay a price for the righteousness that we seek. ",
  "145":"If we seek for righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours: we are in its reality now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age. ",
  "146":"When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts. The Jewish religionists did all these things to the apostles in the early days of the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 5:41; 13:45, 50; 2 Cor. 6:8; Rom. 3:8). ",
  "147":"The persecution in v. 10 is for the sake of righteousness, i.e., is due to our seeking for righteousness, whereas the persecution in v. 11 is directly because of Christ, the new King, i.e., because of our following Him. ",
  "148":"This reward of the ninth blessing indicates that the results of the foregoing eight blessings also are rewards. This reward is great and is in the heavens; it is a heavenly reward, not an earthly one. ",
  "149":"See note 22 in ch. 1. ",
  "150":"The second section of the new King's word given on the mountain, vv. 13-16, concerns the influence of the people of the kingdom of the heavens on the world. They are the salt to the corrupted earth and the light to the darkened world. ",
  "151":"Salt, by nature, is an element that kills and eliminates the germs of corruption. To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such an element, keeping the earth from being fully corrupted. ",
  "152":"For the kingdom people to become tasteless means that they lose their salting function. They become the same as the earthly people and are indistinguishable from the unbelievers. ",
  "153":"To be cast out is to be put away from the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 14:35). ",
  "154":"To be trampled underfoot by men is to be treated as useless dust. ",
  "155":"Light is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness. To the darkened world the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light, effacing the world's darkness. In nature they are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light. ",
  "156":"As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain, a city that cannot be hidden. This will ultimately consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11, 23-24). ",
  "157":"A bushel is an instrument for measuring grain. A lighted lamp placed under a bushel cannot shine out its light. The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by a bushel, an item pertaining to food, concern for which causes people to be anxious (6:25). ",
  "158":"The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As a city on a mountain, the light cannot be hidden, and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden. ",
  "159":"Good works constitute the behavior of the kingdom people; through such works men can see God and be brought to Him. ",
  "160":"To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give the glory to God. ",
  "161":"The title your Father proves that the disciples, who were the new King's audience, were regenerated children of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:6). ",
  "162":"The third section of the King's word on the mountain, vv. 17-48, concerns the law of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "163":"Here for Christ to fulfill the law means (1) that, on the positive side, He kept the law, (2) that, on the negative side, through His substitutionary death on the cross He fulfilled the requirement of the law, and (3) that in this section He complemented the old law with His new law, as repeatedly expressed by the word \"But I say to (or, tell) you\" (vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44). Christ's keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ's fulfilling of the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with the demand that it be kept and the requirement that man be punished, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, now need to fulfill only the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father. The old law was given through Moses, whereas the new law was decreed by Christ personally. <br><br>   Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord's coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God's New Testament economy. ",
  "164":"After the millennial kingdom the old heaven and old earth will pass away when the new heaven and new earth come in (Rev. 21:1; Heb. 1:11-12; 2 Pet. 3:10-13). What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, whereas what is covered by the prophets extends to the new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22). This is why both the law and the prophets are referred to in v. 17, but only the law, not the prophets, is mentioned in v. 18. ",
  "165":"The Greek equivalent of the Hebrew yod, the smallest Hebrew letter, which is shaped like a comma. ",
  "166":"Gk. keraia, a horn, a projection; referring to a mark used with the Hebrew letters. ",
  "167":"Commandments here refers to the law in v. 18. The kingdom people not only fulfill the law but also complement it. Hence, they actually do not annul any commandments of the law. ",
  "168":"Righteousness here does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and are thus justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26); it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is obtained not by merely the fulfilling of the old law, but by the complementing of the old law through the fulfilling of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given by the new King here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (22:11-12), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-8) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future. <br><br>   The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of letters, which they practiced by their own life according to the old law of letters; the surpassing righteousness of the kingdom people is the righteousness of life, which they live out by taking Christ as their life according to the new law of life. Both in nature and in standard, the righteousness of life far surpasses the lifeless righteousness practiced by the scribes and Pharisees. ",
  "169":"See note 4 in ch. 2. ",
  "170":"Entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life (John 3:3, 5), but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration. To enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future. ",
  "171":"The words that \"you have heard\" (vv. 21, 27, 33, 38, 43) are the law of the old dispensation, whereas the words that \"I say to (or, tell) you\" (vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44) are the new law of the kingdom, which complements the law of the old dispensation. ",
  "172":"The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder (v. 21), but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. To meet the demand of the new law of the kingdom, the higher life of the new creation is needed. ",
  "173":"The word brother proves that the King's word here is spoken to believers. ",
  "174":"In this verse there are three kinds of judgments. The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment. The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is a higher judgment. The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgments were mentioned here by the new King, who used figures from the Jewish background because His entire audience was Jewish. However, in regard to the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10, 12; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; and Heb. 10:27, 30. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord's judgment, a judgment not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9). ",
  "175":"I.e., stupid, good-for-nothing. An expression of contempt. ",
  "176":"The Sanhedrin was a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes. It was the highest court of the Jews (Luke 22:66; Acts 4:5-6, 15; 5:27, 34, 41). ",
  "177":"I.e., fool. A Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel (Num. 20:10). This expression is more serious than \"Raca,\" an expression of contempt. ",
  "178":"Gehenna, valley of Henna, is equivalent to the Hebrew Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom. Also called Tophet, or Topheth (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33; Jer. 19:13), it is a deep valley near Jerusalem and was the refuse-place of the city, where all kinds of filth and the bodies of criminals were cast for burning. Because of its continual fire, it became the symbol of the place of eternal punishment, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). This word is used also in vv. 29-30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; and James 3:6. ",
  "179":"A sacrifice, such as the sacrifice for sin, is for dealing with sin, whereas a gift is for fellowship with God. ",
  "180":"The altar was a piece of furniture (Exo. 27:1-8) in the outer court of the temple (1 Kings 8:64). On the altar all the sacrifices and gifts were offered (Lev. 1:9, 12, 17). In decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the King referred here to the gift and altar of the old dispensation because during the period of His ministry on earth, a transitional period, the ritual law of the old dispensation had not yet come to an end. <br><br>   (In the four Gospels, before His death and resurrection, in matters regarding the outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews according to the old law, whereas in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them believers, constituents of the church, according to the New Testament economy.) ",
  "181":"Something against you here must refer to an offense caused by the anger or scolding in v. 22. ",
  "182":"We must first be reconciled to our brother so that our remembrance of the offense can be removed and our conscience can be void of offense. Then we can come and offer our gift to the Lord and fellowship with Him with a pure conscience. The King of the kingdom will never allow two brothers who are not reconciled to each other either to share the kingdom in its reality or to reign in its manifestation. ",
  "183":"Or, placate. ",
  "184":"Be well disposed quickly, lest you die, your opponent die, or the Lord come back, thus leaving you no opportunity to be reconciled to your opponent. ",
  "185":"I.e., a plaintiff. ",
  "186":"On the way signifies that we are still living in this life. ",
  "187":"This will take place at the judgment seat of Christ when He comes back (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10). The judge will be the Lord, the officer will be the angel, and the prison will be the place of discipline. ",
  "188":"Come out from there (prison) refers to being forgiven in the coming age, the millennium. ",
  "189":"A Roman quadrans was a small brass coin equal to a quarter of an assarion, which was equal to one cent. The meaning here is that regarding even the smallest matter we need to make a thorough clearance. This shows the strictness of the new law. ",
  "190":"The law of the old dispensation deals with the outward act of adultery, whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart. ",
  "191":"The emphasis of the new law of the kingdom in this verse and in v. 30 indicates the seriousness of sin in relation to the kingdom of the heavens and the need to put away the motive of sin at any cost. The actions described in these verses were not meant to be carried out literally; they can be carried out only spiritually, as revealed in Rom. 8:13 and Col. 3:5. ",
  "192":"See note 22. So in the next verse. ",
  "193":"See note 29. ",
  "194":"Lit., releases. So in the next verse. ",
  "195":"What the King decreed in vv. 21-30 as the new law of the kingdom complemented the law of the old dispensation, whereas what the King proclaimed in vv. 31-48 as the new law of the kingdom changed the law of the old dispensation. In the old dispensation the law concerning divorce was ordained because of the people's hardness of heart; that law was not according to God's design in the beginning (19:7-8). The King's new decree recovered marriage back to the beginning, back to God's design for it (19:4-6). ",
  "196":"The marriage tie can be broken only by death (Rom. 7:3) or fornication. Hence, to divorce for any other reason is to commit adultery. ",
  "197":"Or, You shall not swear falsely. ",
  "198":"Lit., repay. An oath includes a vow that needs to be repaid. Hence, to repay what is vowed is to render our oaths. ",
  "199":"The new law of the kingdom forbids the kingdom people to swear in any manner &#151; by heaven, by the earth, unto Jerusalem, or by their head &#151; because heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and their head are not under their control but under God's. ",
  "200":"The word of the kingdom people should be simple and true: \"Yes, yes; No, no.\" They should not try to convince others with many words; they should be those who are true and of few words.",
  "201":"Lit., out of. ",
  "202":"Or, evil. ",
  "203":"Turning to the striker the other cheek also, yielding to the suer the cloak also (v. 40), and going with the compeller the second mile (v. 41) prove that the kingdom people have the power to suffer instead of resisting, and the power to walk not in the flesh or the soul for their own interests but in the spirit for the kingdom. ",
  "204":"A shirt-like undergarment. So throughout the book. ",
  "205":"An ancient Roman mile, equal to a thousand paces. ",
  "206":"Giving to one who asks and not turning away from a borrower prove that the kingdom people do not care for material things and are not possessed by them. ",
  "207":"The title sons of your Father is a strong proof that the kingdom people, who are the audience here for the new King's decree on the mountain, are the regenerated believers of the New Testament. ",
  "208":"The sending of rain on the just and the unjust occurs in the age of grace, but in the coming age, the age of the kingdom, no rain will come on the unjust (Zech. 14:17-18). ",
  "209":"The kingdom people who observe the new law of the kingdom in the kingdom's reality will be given a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom. The reward differs from salvation. A person can be saved yet not be rewarded. (See note 35 in Heb. 10.) ",
  "210":"Those who collected the taxes levied by the Romans. Nearly all of them abused their office by making excessive demands based on false accusation (Luke 3:12-13; 19:2, 8). Paying taxes to the Romans was very bitter to the Jews. Those engaged in collecting taxes were despised by the people and counted unworthy of respect (Luke 18:9-10). Hence, they were classed with sinners (9:10-11). ",
  "211":"For the kingdom people to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect means that they are perfect in His love. They are the Father's children, having the Father's divine life and divine nature. Hence, they can be perfect as their Father is. The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. This higher demand can be met only by the Father's divine life, not by the natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand. First, the gospel presents in the Gospel of Matthew the kingdom of the heavens as the highest demand, and last, it affords us in the Gospel of John the divine life of the heavenly Father as the highest supply, by which we can have the highest living of the kingdom of the heavens. The demand of the new law of the kingdom in chs. 5--7 is actually the expression of the new life, the divine life, which is within the regenerated kingdom people. This demand opens up the inner being of the regenerated people, showing them that they are able to attain to such a high level and to have such a high living. ",
  "212":"The fourth section of the King's decree on the mountain, vv. 1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. ",
  "213":"Righteousness here denotes righteous deeds, such as giving alms (vv. 2-4), praying (vv. 5-15), and fasting (vv. 16-18). ",
  "214":"Man's flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men's praise. But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh to gain the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit to please their heavenly Father. ",
  "215":"To the kingdom people God is not only their God but also their Father; they are not only created by God but also regenerated by the Father. They have not only the created, natural human life but also the uncreated, spiritual divine life. Hence, the new law of the kingdom, decreed by the King on the mountain, is given to them with the intention that they should keep it not by their fallen human life but by the Father's eternal, divine life, not to gain man's glory but to receive the Father's reward. ",
  "216":"Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting. ",
  "217":"A stage actor, an impersonator. It was a custom for Greek and Roman actors to wear large masks with mechanical devices that increased the force of their voice. Hence, a dissembler. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "218":"See note 23 in ch. 4. So throughout the book. ",
  "219":"Indicating that, as much as possible, the righteous deeds of the kingdom people should be kept secret. What they do in their spirit under the heavenly rule to please solely their Father must not be interfered with by their flesh in its lusting for man's glory. ",
  "220":"The kingdom people live by the Father's divine life and walk according to their spirit. Thus, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public. Public exhibition does not correspond with the mysterious, hidden nature of the divine life. ",
  "221":"The kingdom people, as children of the heavenly Father, must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father's presence. Whatever they do in secret for the Father's kingdom is seen in secret by the Father, and He will repay them. Their heavenly Father's seeing in secret must be an incentive to doing their righteous deeds in secret. So in vv. 6 and 18. ",
  "222":"This may occur in this age (2 Cor. 9:10-11) or as a reward in the coming age (Luke 14:14). ",
  "223":"Prayer that seeks man's praise may gain a reward from men, but it will not receive an answer from the Father; thus, it is vain prayer. ",
  "224":"The kingdom people must have some experience of praying in their private room, through which they contact their heavenly Father in secret, experience some secret enjoyment of the Father, and receive some secret answer from Him. ",
  "225":"This does not mean that we should not repeat our prayer. The Lord repeated His prayer three times in Gethsemane (26:44), the apostle Paul prayed the same prayer three times (2 Cor. 12:8), and the great multitude in heaven praised God repeatedly with hallelujahs (Rev. 19:1-6). It means that we should not repeat empty words, words spoken in vain. ",
  "226":"Although God our Father knows our need, we still must ask Him, because he who asks receives (7:8). ",
  "227":"In this way does not mean that we should recite this prayer. In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting. ",
  "228":"In the example of prayer given as a pattern by the Lord, the first three petitions imply the Trinity of the Godhead: \"Your name be sanctified\" is related mainly to the Father; \"Your kingdom come,\" to the Son; and \"Your will be done,\" to the Spirit. This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be ultimately fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (Psa. 8:1), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the will of God will be accomplished. ",
  "229":"After the rebellion of Satan (Ezek. 28:17; Isa. 14:13-15), the earth fell into his usurping hand. Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (Gen. 1:26-28). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth could be recovered for God's interest, so that the will of God could be done on earth as in heaven. This is why the new King established the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God's will in the coming kingdom age. ",
  "230":"This prayer, as a pattern, cares first for God's name, God's kingdom, and God's will, and second, for our need. ",
  "231":"The King does not want His people to worry about tomorrow (v. 34); He wants them to pray only for today's needs. ",
  "232":"Or, bread until tomorrow, bread for this day. Daily bread indicates a living that is by faith. The kingdom people should not live on what they have stored; rather, they should live, by faith, on the Father's daily supply. ",
  "233":"This prayer, as a pattern, cares, third, for the kingdom people's failures before God and for their relationship with others. The kingdom people should ask the Father to forgive their debts, their failures, their trespasses, as they forgive their debtors to maintain peace. ",
  "234":"The King had been led by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil (4:1). ",
  "235":"Or, evil. This prayer, as a pattern, cares, fourth, for the kingdom people's deliverance from the evil one and from evil things. The kingdom people should ask the Father not to bring them into temptation but to deliver them from the evil one, the devil, and from the evil that is out of him. ",
  "236":"This sentence is omitted in the earliest manuscripts. ",
  "237":"The kingdom is the realm in which God exercises His power so that He can express His glory. ",
  "238":"Amen, from Hebrew, means firm, steadfast, or trustworthy. ",
  "239":"For indicates that the word in vv. 14-15 is an explanation of why the kingdom people must forgive their debtors (v. 12). If they do not forgive man's offenses, neither will their heavenly Father forgive their offenses. In such a case, their prayer will be frustrated. ",
  "240":"To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is to be unable to eat because of a desperate burden to pray for certain things. It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking God's mercy. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy. ",
  "241":"The fifth section of the King's decree, vv. 19-34, concerns the riches of the kingdom people. ",
  "242":"To store up treasures in heaven is to give material things to the poor (19:21) and to care for the needy saints (Acts 2:45; 4:34-35; 11:29; Rom. 15:26) and the Lord's servants (Phil. 4:16-17). ",
  "243":"The kingdom people must send their treasure to heaven so that their heart also can be in heaven. ",
  "244":"Our two eyes can focus on only one thing at a time. If we endeavor to see two things at once, our vision will be blurred. If we focus our eyes on one thing, our vision will be single and our whole body will be full of light. If we store up our treasure both in heaven and on earth, our spiritual vision will be blurred. For our vision to be single, we must store up our treasure in one place. ",
  "245":"To look at two objects at the same time, not focusing on one object alone, is to make our eye evil (cf. 20:15; Deut. 15:9; Prov. 28:22). In such a case, our whole body will be dark. ",
  "246":"If our heart is fixed on treasure laid up on earth, the light that is in us will become darkness, and great will be the darkness. ",
  "247":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "248":"In Greek, hold to one and despise the other means to be devoted to one and be against the other. ",
  "249":"An Aramaic word signifying wealth, riches. Mammon stands in opposition to God, indicating that wealth, or riches, is the opponent of God, robbing God's people of their service to Him. ",
  "250":"Lit., soul. Referring to the soul-life, where the desire, the appetite, for food and clothing resides (Isa. 29:8). ",
  "251":"Our life is more than food, and our body is more than clothing. Both our life and our body were brought into existence by God, not by our anxiety. Since God created us with a life and a body, surely He will care for their needs. The kingdom people do not need to be anxious about this. ",
  "252":"Or, the length of his life (similar to lifetime in Psa. 39:5, lit.). ",
  "253":"Lilies signify people under the care of God (S.S. 2:1-2). ",
  "254":"The kingdom people have the divine life of their heavenly Father as their strength to keep the new law of the kingdom. They also have their heavenly Father as the One who cares for their material needs, so that they do not need to be anxious about it. Their heavenly Father is the source of their strength and supply. Hence, they need not be weak or wanting. ",
  "255":"The Father's kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, the reality of the church life today, and will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age. The Father's righteousness is the righteousness expressed by the keeping of the new law of the kingdom, as mentioned in 5:20. This righteousness is Christ, who is lived out by the kingdom people. Since the kingdom people seek first the kingdom and the righteousness of their heavenly Father, not only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to them, but also all that they need will be added to them. ",
  "256":"The kingdom people should never live in tomorrow but always in today. ",
  "257":"Not the same Greek word as for evil in note 13. Evil here denotes trouble and affliction. This indicates that the King of the kingdom has made it clear to the kingdom people that their days on earth for the kingdom will be days of trouble and affliction, not of ease and comfort. ",
  "258":"The sixth section of the new King's decree on the mountain, vv. 1-12, concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others. ",
  "259":"The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others. ",
  "260":"Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the kingdom people will be judged with what they judge others. If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged with righteousness by the Lord; if they judge others with mercy, they will be judged with mercy by the Lord. Mercy triumphs over judgment (James 2:13). ",
  "261":"As the kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the beam in our own eye whenever we look at the splinter in our brother's eye. The splinter in our brother's eye must remind us of the beam in our own eye. ",
  "262":"See note 2 in ch. 6. ",
  "263":"As long as the beam remains in our eye, our vision is blurred and we cannot see clearly. ",
  "264":"That which is holy must refer to the objective truth, which belongs to God; your pearls must refer to the subjective experiences, which are ours. ",
  "265":"Dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud; hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud. Thus, both are unclean (Lev. 11:27, 7). According to the revelation in 2 Pet. 2:12, 19-22, and Phil. 3:2, dogs and hogs here refer to people who are religious but not clean. ",
  "266":"First ask, then seek, and last knock. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way. ",
  "267":"This part of the King's promise in this verse is applicable to the prayer of the kingdom people concerning their keeping of the new law of the kingdom. They ask for this and will receive it. ",
  "268":"This part of the King's promise is applicable to 6:33. The kingdom people seek the Father's kingdom and His righteousness and will find them. ",
  "269":"This part of the King's promise can be applied to v. 14. The narrow gate will be opened to the kingdom people as a result of their knocking. ",
  "270":"This is a great promise. Such a promise affirms that the kingdom people are being cared for and supplied by their Father who is in the heavens. Thus, they are well able to fulfill the new law of the kingdom and live in the kingdom's reality that they may enter into its manifestation. ",
  "271":"In the parallel verse, Luke 11:13, it is the Holy Spirit instead of good things, because Luke emphasizes the blessing of the gospel, the center of which is the Spirit (Gal. 3:8, 14). Since Matthew stresses the kingdom of the heavens, good things should refer to the blessings of the reality of the kingdom, as revealed in chs. 5--7, blessings to be given as gifts to the kingdom people. ",
  "272":"The new law of the kingdom does not contradict the law and the prophets; rather, it fulfills them and even complements them. ",
  "273":"The seventh and last section of the King's decree, vv. 13-29, concerns the ground of the kingdom people's living and work. ",
  "274":"Lit., leads away. So in the next verse. ",
  "275":"Destruction here does not refer to the perishing of the person himself, but to the destruction of a person's deeds and work (1 Cor. 3:15). ",
  "276":"The gate is narrow and the way is constricted because the new law of the kingdom is stricter and the demand of the kingdom higher than the law and the demand of the old covenant. The narrow gate deals not only with outward conduct but also with inward motive. The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; only that which corresponds with God's will can enter in. The kingdom people need first to enter in through such a narrow gate, and then to walk on such a constricted way. It is not that they first walk the way and then enter in through the gate. To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong. ",
  "277":"Life here refers to the ever-blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God. This life is in the reality of the kingdom today and will be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age (19:29; Luke 18:30). ",
  "278":"Lit., extortionate. ",
  "279":"To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Hence, not everyone who says, \"Lord, Lord,\" will enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father will enter in. <br><br>   Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration (John 3:3, 5). The latter entrance is gained through being born of the divine life; the former, through the living of that life. ",
  "280":"That day refers to the day of the judgment seat of Christ (1 Cor. 3:13; 4:5; 2 Cor. 5:10). ",
  "281":"Knew here means approved. The same word in Rom. 7:15 is translated acknowledge. The Lord never approved those who, in His name, prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power (v. 22), but did those things not according to the will of the heavenly Father (v. 21). The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father; they were not done in line with the divine will. Thus, those who do such things, even in the Lord's name, will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but will depart from the Lord, that is, be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age. ",
  "282":"Rock does not refer to Christ but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens. The living and work of the kingdom people must be founded on the word of the new King for the accomplishing of the will of the heavenly Father. This is to enter in through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way that leads to life. ",
  "283":"The rain, which descends from the heavens, is of God; the rivers, which come from the earth, are of man; and the winds, which blow from the air, are of Satan. All these will test the living and work of the kingdom people. ",
  "284":"The house built on the rock, a house that does not fall, is like the work that is built with gold, silver, and precious stones, a work that can stand the testing fire (1 Cor. 3:12-13). ",
  "285":"Sand refers to human concepts and natural ways. If we live and work according to our human concepts and natural ways, our living and work will be founded on sinking sand. This is to enter in through the wide gate and walk the broad way that leads to destruction. ",
  "286":"The house built on sand, a house that falls, is like the work that is built with wood, hay, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire. However, the builder himself will be saved (1 Cor. 3:12-15). ",
  "287":"Christ, as the new King of the kingdom of the heavens, spoke with authority in decreeing the new law of the kingdom. ",
  "288":"After decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the new King came down from the mountain to carry on His kingly ministry. The first things He did were to cleanse the unclean, heal the sick, and cast the demons out of the possessed that they might become people of the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 2-17). ",
  "289":"The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper. According to the examples in the Scriptures, leprosy results from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God's deputy authority (Num. 12:1-10). Naaman's leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience (2 Kings 5:1, 9-14). All fallen human beings have become leprous in the eyes of God because of their rebellion. The kingly Savior came to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy that they might become His kingdom people. ",
  "290":"The leper worshipped the new King and called Him \"Lord,\" recognizing that He is the Lord God. In reality the new King is Jehovah the Savior &#151; Jesus. (See note 21 in ch. 1.) ",
  "291":"According to the law, a leper was to be isolated from the people because of his uncleanness. No one was allowed to touch him (Lev. 13:45-46). But the new King, as a man and as the kingly Savior, touched this leper. What mercy and sympathy! By His one touch, his leprosy was immediately cleansed. What wonderful cleansing! ",
  "292":"The new King told the cleansed leper that for his cleansing he should continue to do things according to the regulations of the old law, because the transitional period still remained, the old law having not yet been fulfilled by His redeeming death. ",
  "293":"An officer over one hundred soldiers in the Roman army. The leper in vv. 2-4 represents the Jews, whereas the centurion in vv. 5-13 represents the Gentiles. Before God, the Jews had become leprous, unclean, because of their rebellion and disobedience, whereas the Gentiles had become paralyzed, dead in function, because of their sinfulness. The kingly Savior came first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles (Acts 3:26; 13:46; Rom. 1:16; 11:11). The believing Jews were saved by His direct touch (v. 3), whereas the believing Gentiles are saved through faith in His word (vv. 8, 10, 13). ",
  "294":"The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal. Thus, he believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word. This was stronger faith, and it was marveled at by the Savior (v. 10). ",
  "295":"Some ancient MSS read, Not even in Israel have I found such great faith. ",
  "296":"This indicates that the Gentiles will participate in the gospel of the kingdom (Eph. 3:6, 8; Gal. 2:8-9; Rom. 1:13-16). ",
  "297":"This refers to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming Gentile believers will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. ",
  "298":"The sons of the kingdom are the saved Jews, who are the good seed (13:38) but whose faith is not strong enough to enable them to enter in through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way (7:13-14). They will miss the feast in the manifestation of the kingdom (Luke 13:24-30). ",
  "299":"The outer darkness is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (16:28; 25:30). Being cast out into the outer darkness in the coming kingdom age differs from being cast into the lake of fire after the millennium and for eternity (Rev. 20:15). ",
  "300":"Weeping indicates regret, and gnashing of teeth indicates self blame. ",
  "301":"Peter's mother-in-law in vv. 14-15 represents the Jews living at the end of this age, who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior (Rom. 11:25-26). At that time, during the great tribulation, the Jews in the eyes of God will be \"in a fever\" (v. 14), \"hot\" in things other than God. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the kingly Savior will come back to this remnant of the Jews that they may be saved (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10). Peter's mother-in-law was healed in Peter's house. At the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel. Furthermore, they will be saved by the kingly Savior's direct touch (v. 15), as was the Jewish leper (v. 3). ",
  "302":"Many who were demon possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium. The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus, it is considered the \"evening\" of the old heaven and old earth. In the millennium the power to cast out demons and heal illnesses will be manifested to the uttermost. Hence, all the demon possessed and all the sick will be healed. Such extensive power is the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5). The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age. The signs recorded in vv. 2-17 bear a dispensational significance and show the coming kingdom in miniature. <br><br>   The order of the four incidents recorded in vv. 2-16 differs from that in Mark 1:29--2:1 and Luke 4:38-41; 5:12-14; 7:1-10. In Mark's record, which shows that Jesus is the Servant of God, the order is according to history. In Matthew's record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i.e., Matthew puts certain incidents together to present a doctrine. In Luke's record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man's Savior, the order is according to morality. In John's record, which testifies that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, the order is somewhat according to history. ",
  "303":"All healings accomplished on fallen people are a result of the Lord's redemption. On the cross He took away our infirmities, bore our diseases, and accomplished full healing for us. However, in this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste. ",
  "304":"In His ministry as recorded in the four Gospels, the Lord always withdrew from the crowds; He did not want the curious ones to be with Him. He did not care for crowds but cared only for those who sought Him sincerely. ",
  "305":"In saying this he did not consider the cost. Hence, the King answered in v. 20 in a way that caused him to consider the cost. ",
  "306":"Lit., depart. ",
  "307":"In His kingly ministry the new King continually took the standing of the Son of Man, until 16:13-17. ",
  "308":"Even the foxes and the birds have a resting place, but the King of the kingdom did not have a resting place. This proves that the kingdom He was establishing was not material, not of an earthly nature, but was spiritual, of a heavenly nature. ",
  "309":"In so saying, this disciple, who was not a scribe, overly considered the cost of following the King of the heavenly kingdom. Hence, the King answered him by encouraging him to follow Him, to drop his consideration of the cost, and to leave the burial of his father to others. ",
  "310":"The first dead refers to those who are dead spiritually, as mentioned in Eph. 2:1, 5; the second dead refers to the disciple's father, who was dead physically. ",
  "311":"Lit., quaking, or, shaking. ",
  "312":"Faith comes from and depends on the word of the Lord (Rom. 10:17). In v. 18 the Lord gave them a word, telling them to depart to the other side. If they had believed that word, they would not have needed to pray as they did in v. 25. They did not have a full realization concerning the Lord's word; thus, their faith was little. ",
  "313":"A rebuke is not given to lifeless things but to things with personality. The King rebuked the winds and the sea because in the winds were the fallen angels of Satan (Eph. 6:12) and in the sea were the demons (v. 32). The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the King from going to the other side of the sea because they knew He would cast out the demons there (vv. 28-32). ",
  "314":"Great is in contrast to little in the first part of this verse. ",
  "315":"Actually, it was not the winds and the sea that obeyed the King's authority but the fallen angels above the winds and the demons under the sea. ",
  "316":"Lit., What to us and to You? (a Hebrew idiom). ",
  "317":"The King called Himself the Son of Man (v. 20), but the demons called Him the Son of God, tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man. (See note 3 in ch. 4.) ",
  "318":"Before the time implies that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented and that the demons know that time, which will be after the millennium and for eternity. (See note 13 in Rev. 20.) ",
  "319":"This indicates that the demons were under the power and authority of the King. ",
  "320":"This was the King's authoritative order, and the demons obeyed it. The King complied with the demons' entreaty and allowed them to enter into the hogs because hogs are unclean in the eyes of God (Lev. 11:7). ",
  "321":"The hogs would not tolerate being possessed by the demons, and they rushed into the sea. The demons consented because the water is their lodging place (12:43-44; see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). ",
  "322":"The people of the city, having lost their hogs, rejected the King. They wanted their unclean hogs but did not want the King of the heavenly kingdom. They probably were Gentiles. (Gadara was on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, across from Galilee of the Gentiles &#151; 4:15.) They rejected the heavenly King because of their unclean way of making a living. ",
  "323":"Capernaum, where the Lord now dwelt (4:13). ",
  "324":"They dug through the roof of the house where the Lord was (Mark 2:4). By this the Lord saw their faith. ",
  "325":"This indicates that the paralytic was sick because of his sins. ",
  "326":"See note 4 in ch. 2. ",
  "327":"The scribes, confident that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, had blasphemed God when He said, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" This indicates that they did not realize that the Lord was God. By uttering such a word they rejected the King of the heavenly kingdom. This was the first rejection by the leaders of the Jewish religion. ",
  "328":"Some ancient MSS read, seeing. This was the Lord's perception in His spirit (Mark 2:8). ",
  "329":"Or, cogitations, inward reasonings. Evil surmisings with strong feeling or passion. ",
  "330":"The Lord did not ask, \"Which is more difficult?\" because to Him nothing is difficult. For Him to say, \"Your sins are forgiven,\" was easier than to say, \"Rise and walk.\" ",
  "331":"In the Lord's salvation He not only forgives our sins but also causes us to rise and walk. It is not that we first rise and walk and then are forgiven of our sins; such a salvation would be by works. Rather, we first are forgiven of our sins and then rise and walk; such a salvation is by grace. ",
  "332":"To forgive sins is a matter of having authority on earth. Only this kingly Savior, who had been authorized by God and who would die to redeem sinners, had such authority (Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38). This authority was for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens (16:19). ",
  "333":"The Lord enabled the paralytic not only to walk but also to take up his bed and walk. Formerly, the bed had borne him; now he bore it. This is the power of the Lord's salvation. ",
  "334":"This paralytic was brought to the Lord by others, but he went home by himself. This indicates that it is not that the sinner can go to the Lord, but that the sinner can go from the Lord by the Lord's salvation. ",
  "335":"The paralytic's rising and going proved that he was healed, and his being healed proved that his sins were forgiven. ",
  "336":"Matthew was also called Levi (Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27). He was a tax collector (10:3) who, after being saved, became an apostle by God's grace (10:2-3; Acts 1:13). He was the writer of this Gospel. ",
  "337":"Following the Lord includes believing in Him. No one follows Him unless he believes in Him. To believe in the Lord is to be saved (Acts 16:31), and to follow Him is to enter in through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way to participate in the kingdom of the heavens (7:13-14). ",
  "338":"According to the record in this verse, it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew. There must have been some attracting power, either in the Lord's word or in His appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him. ",
  "339":"This was Matthew's house (Luke 5:29; Mark 2:15). As the writer of this Gospel, Matthew purposely did not say that it was his house or that it was he who had made a great feast for the Lord. This displayed his humility. ",
  "340":"See note 46 in ch. 5. ",
  "341":"See note 7 in ch. 3. ",
  "342":"This question indicates that the self-righteous Pharisees did not know the grace of God. They thought that God deals with man only according to righteousness. By asking this, they were exposed as dissenting from the heavenly King, and thus as those who had rejected Him. This was a continuation of the rejection of the heavenly King, begun in v. 3, by the leaders of the Jewish religion. ",
  "343":"In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge. A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace. Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers (8:2-4), paralytics (8:5-13; 9:2-8), the fever-ridden (8:14-15), the demon possessed (8:16, 28-32), those ill with all kinds of diseases (8:16), despised tax collectors, and sinners (vv. 9-11). If He had visited these pitiful people as a Judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom. However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens, with whom He could establish His heavenly kingdom on this corrupted earth. ",
  "344":"The Lord's word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not realize that they needed Him as a Physician. They considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill. ",
  "345":"The self-righteous Pharisees were confident that they knew all things concerning God. In order to humble them, the Lord told them to learn more. ",
  "346":"Mercy is part of the grace that man receives from God. (See note 16 in Heb. 4.) But self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to give something to God. This is contrary to God's way in His economy. Just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us to show mercy in love to others (Micah 6:6-8; Mark 12:33). ",
  "347":"There is none righteous, not even one (Rom. 3:10). All the \"righteous\" are self-righteous, as were the Pharisees (Luke 18:9). The kingly Savior did not come to call these, but sinners. ",
  "348":"Verses 10-13 record the Lord's dealing with the question from the Pharisees, who were of the old religion. Here in vv. 14-17 the Lord dealt with the problem of John's disciples, who were of the new religion. John the Baptist had dropped the old religion and had begun his ministry in the wilderness, outside religion. (See notes 1 and 4 in ch. 3.) However, after a short time his disciples formed a new religion that frustrated people from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees of the old religion had done. John the Baptist's ministry was to introduce people to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all. However, some of John's disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion. To be religious is to do something for God, without Christ. To do anything, even if it is scriptural and fundamental, without the presence of Christ is to be religious. Both John's disciples, who were of the new religion, and the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, fasted much, but without Christ. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence. ",
  "349":"See note 16 in ch. 6. ",
  "350":"Some ancient authorities omit, much. ",
  "351":"The self-righteous Pharisees, who were of the old religion, were bothered when Christ made Himself a companion of tax collectors and sinners, whom the Pharisees condemned (v. 11). The fasting disciples of John, who were of the new religion, were troubled by the feasting of Christ and His disciples (v. 10). ",
  "352":"The disciples of the Lord. In the transitional period of the Lord's ministry on earth, His disciples were the sons of the bridechamber. Later, they will become the bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7). ",
  "353":"In dealing with the self-righteous and dissenting Pharisees, who were of the old religion, the kingly Savior indicated that He was a Physician who had come to heal the sick (v. 12). In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John, who were of the new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride. John the Baptist had told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride (John 3:25-29). Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. Both a physician and a bridegroom are pleasant persons. The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride. They should have laid hold of Him not only as their Physician, that their life might be recovered, but also as their Bridegroom, that they might have the enjoyment of living in His presence. They were with Him at a joyful wedding, not without Him at a mournful funeral. How then could they fast and not feast before Him? The dissenting question from John's disciples indicated that some of them had fallen into a new religion and had rejected the kingly Savior. <br><br>   The question from John's disciples seemed to relate to doctrine. However, the Lord answered not with a doctrine but with a person, the most pleasant person, the Bridegroom. The religious people always care for their doctrine, asking \"why\" in a doctrinal way. But Christ cares only for Himself. The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by Himself and His presence, not by any doctrine. ",
  "354":"This took place when the kingly Savior was taken up from the disciples into heaven (Acts 1:11). After that, they fasted (Acts 13:2-3; 14:23). ",
  "355":"Or, new, raw, unwrought. The Greek word is formed with not and to card or comb wool. Thus, the word means uncarded, unsteamed and unwashed, unfinished, unfulled, untreated. The unfulled cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ as a new robe after He was \"treated\" in His crucifixion. (The Greek word for new in Luke 5:36 is the same as for fresh in Matt. 9:17.) Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). A patch of unfulled cloth sewn on an old garment pulls away from the garment because of the strength of its shrinking, thus making the tear worse. To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. This is what today's modernists are attempting to do. They only imitate Jesus' human deeds to improve their behavior; they do not believe in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer or in the resurrected Christ as their righteousness that they may be justified by God and acceptable to Him. Their imitating of Christ's human living \"pulls away\" from their \"old garment,\" their behavior produced by their old, natural life. The kingdom people would not do this; they take the crucified and resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God. ",
  "356":"The old garment signifies the good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices produced by man's old, natural life. ",
  "357":"The Greek word for new means new in time, recent, newly possessed. The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring people to excitement. The kingly Savior is not only the Bridegroom to the kingdom people for their enjoyment but also their new garment for them to be equipped outwardly that they may be qualified to attend the wedding. Furthermore, He is their new life to stir them up inwardly to enjoy Him as their Bridegroom. He, as the heavenly King, is the Bridegroom for the kingdom people's enjoyment, and His heavenly kingdom is His wedding feast (22:2), at which they will enjoy Him. To enjoy Him as the Bridegroom in the kingdom feast, they need Him as their new garment outwardly and their new wine inwardly. ",
  "358":"The old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting maintained by the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, and by the disciples of John, who were of the new religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by the power of its fermenting. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion. This is what the so-called fundamentalists and Pentecostalists are practicing today. They attempt to squeeze Christ into their different modes of religious ritual, formality, and practice. The kingdom people should never do this. They must put the new wine into fresh wineskins. ",
  "359":"The Greek word for fresh means new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused; hence, fresh. The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The kingdom people are built into the church (16:18), and the church is expressed through the local churches in which the kingdom people live (18:15-20). They are regenerated persons who constitute the Body of Christ and become the church (Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:22-23). The Body of Christ as His fullness is also called \"the Christ\" (1 Cor. 12:12), referring to the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the inward exciting life, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the outward container that holds the new wine. With the kingdom people it is not a matter of fasting or any other religious practice, but a matter of the church life with Christ as their content. Christ came to establish not an earthly religion of rituals but a heavenly kingdom of life. He is establishing such a kingdom not with any dead religious practices but with Himself, the living person, as the Savior, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unfulled cloth, and the new wine to His followers for their full enjoyment, that they may be the fresh wineskin to contain Him and may become the constituents of His kingdom. ",
  "360":"Verses 18-34 give a brief picture of this age and the coming age. Hence, the record in this section has a dispensational significance, as did the record in 8:1-17. The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles. When the daughter died, the woman was healed. After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Subsequently, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews were cut off, the Gentiles were saved, and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved (Rom. 11:15, 17, 19, 23-26). After that, the millennium will begin, in which all the blind and dumb will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6). ",
  "361":"Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue (Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41). His name means he will enlighten, or enlightened, signifying that the Lord will enlighten the Gentiles (Acts 13:46-48) and that the Jews also will be enlightened. ",
  "362":"A bloody flux, a flow or issue of blood (Lev. 15:25). The life of the flesh is in the blood (Lev. 17:11). Hence, this disease signifies a life that cannot be retained. ",
  "363":"The woman had been sick for twelve years, the age of the ruler's dead daughter (Luke 8:42). ",
  "364":"The woman here and the centurion in 8:5-10, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way &#151; with faith. The woman was healed while the Lord was on the way to the ruler's house. This signifies that the Gentiles are saved while Christ is on the way to the house of Israel. ",
  "365":"Christ's garment signifies His righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling (Num. 15:38-39). Out of Christ's heaven-ruled deeds issues the virtue that becomes the healing power (14:36). ",
  "366":"This was her faith. ",
  "367":"Or, saved. So in the next verse. ",
  "368":"The daughter here and Peter's mother-in-law in 8:14-15, both representing the Jews at the end of this age, were healed in a house by the Lord's coming and His direct touch. This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord's coming and His direct touch (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10). ",
  "369":"In His ministry the Lord never cared to have a crowd. See note 18 in ch. 8. ",
  "370":"Lit., was roused. ",
  "371":"Blindness signifies the lack of inward sight, the inability to see God and the things related to Him (2 Cor. 4:4; Rev. 3:18). ",
  "372":"In the millennial kingdom, that is, in the restored tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the Messianic kingdom, the Jews will recognize Christ as the Son of David, and their blindness will be healed. This is typified by the two blind men recognizing Christ as the Son of David. ",
  "373":"Like the ruler's daughter (v. 23) and Peter's mother-in-law (8:14), the two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord's direct touch (v. 29). ",
  "374":"The opening of the blind men's eyes signifies the recovery of inward sight, by which we see God and spiritual things (Acts 9:18; 26:18; Eph. 1:18; Rev. 3:18). ",
  "375":"Dumbness caused by demon possession signifies man's inability to speak for God (Isa. 56:10) and praise God (Isa. 35:6) because of his worshipping of dumb idols (1 Cor. 12:2). ",
  "376":"The dumb man's speaking signifies that our speaking and praising ability is recovered by our being filled with the Lord in the spirit (Eph. 5:18-19). ",
  "377":"The ruler of the demons is the devil, who was called Beelzebul (12:24). This blaspheming word by the Pharisees was a strong continuation of the rejection of the heavenly King by the leaders of Judaism. ",
  "378":"See note 23 in ch. 4. ",
  "379":"Every disease and every sickness signifies spiritual illness. ",
  "380":"In Greek harassed refers to the sheep's being skinned by a cruel shepherd and thus suffering pain. Cast away refers to the sheep's being abandoned by a wicked shepherd and falling into a distressed condition in which they are homeless, wandering from place to place, and helpless. The Lord Jesus' word here depicts a situation in which the pitiful Israelites were afflicted and in anguish under the hands of the chief priests and scribes, the evil shepherds. ",
  "381":"This indicates that the heavenly King considered the Israelites sheep and Himself their Shepherd. When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, the demon possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons because they had no shepherd to care for them. Now in His kingly ministry for the establishing of His heavenly kingdom, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in Isa. 53:6 and 40:11. ",
  "382":"The heavenly King considered the people not only sheep but also the harvest. The sheep needed shepherding and the harvest needed reaping. Although the leaders of the nation of Israel had rejected the heavenly King, there were still a good number among the people who needed reaping. ",
  "383":"First, in His economy God has a plan to accomplish; then there is the need for His people to beseech Him, to pray to Him, concerning it. In answering their prayer, He will accomplish what they have prayed concerning His plan. ",
  "384":"The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep but also the Lord of the harvest. His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply. He is the Lord who owns this crop. ",
  "385":"I.e., to participate in His harvest. ",
  "386":"See note 12 in Rev. 21. So also in v. 2. ",
  "387":"The authority to cast out unclean spirits and heal diseases is a foretaste of the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5), that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6). ",
  "388":"An apostle is a sent one. Now the twelve disciples (v. 1) were to be sent; thus they became the twelve apostles. ",
  "389":"Mark and Luke listed Matthew before Thomas (Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15), but Matthew, the writer of this book, listed himself after Thomas, showing his humility. ",
  "390":"Here Matthew specifically designated himself \"the tax collector,\" perhaps remembering his salvation with gratitude. Even a despised and sinful tax collector could become an apostle of the King of the heavenly kingdom. What a salvation! ",
  "391":"Thaddaeus here is Judas (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13; John 14:22). ",
  "392":"From the Hebrew word kanna, meaning zealous; referring not to the land of Canaan but to a Galilean sect known as the Zealots. (See Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13.) ",
  "393":"This word, probably from Hebrew, means a man of Kerioth. Kerioth was in Judah (Josh. 15:25). Among the apostles, only Judas was from Judea; all the rest were Galileans. ",
  "394":"Lit., delivered Him up. So throughout the book. ",
  "395":"The Samaritans were a mixture of Gentile and Jewish blood (2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:10; John 4:9). The twelve apostles were sent to the house of Israel (v. 6) and were charged not to go to the Gentiles or to the Samaritans. ",
  "396":"Even by that time the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come but had only drawn near. ",
  "397":"The twelve apostles (sent to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles), as workers worthy of their food, did not need to bring their necessities with them. (However, the Lord's workers sent to the Gentiles should take nothing from the Gentiles &#151; 3 John 7.) This principle was changed after the Lord had been fully rejected by the house of Israel (Luke 22:35-38). ",
  "398":"Indicating that the punishment resulting from God's judgment is in varying degrees. Rejecting the Lord's apostles and their words (v. 14) will bring more punishment than will the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. ",
  "399":"As sheep in the midst of wolves, the Lord's apostles, although not serpents, need to be prudent as serpents to escape being hurt by the wolves, and guileless as doves, not mixed with any evil intention and not hurting others. ",
  "400":"The heavenly King's prediction here concerning the persecution of His apostles by Judaism indicated that the kingdom He was establishing through His apostles' preaching would be rejected by Judaism. This too proves that His kingdom is not earthly but heavenly. ",
  "401":"See note 22 in ch. 5. ",
  "402":"The same Greek word as for princes in 2:6. ",
  "403":"The apostles have not only the authority of the heavenly King (v. 1) but also the Spirit of their Father. The King's authority deals with unclean spirits and diseases; the Father's Spirit deals with the opposers' persecution. ",
  "404":"Those who would be the heavenly King's apostles for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom must suffer the breaking of the closest human ties. ",
  "405":"Here, to be saved may mean to be saved from those who hate us; eventually, it will mean to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, a reward to the overcoming believers. This differs from eternal salvation as revealed in Eph. 2:8. ",
  "406":"This word was not fulfilled by the twelve apostles' preaching before Christ's crucifixion. It will not be fulfilled until the great tribulation (24:21). The prediction in vv. 17-23 is very similar to that in 24:9-13. Here the heavenly King sent the apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews. After His resurrection He sent His apostles to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, He will send His apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom again to the Jews. At that time, this word will be fulfilled, and He will come. ",
  "407":"According to the context, the word here means that in suffering persecution His apostles cannot be above Him, because He was persecuted to the uttermost. ",
  "408":"Beelzebub, meaning the lord of flies, was the name of the god of the Ekronites (2 Kings 1:2). It was changed contemptuously by the Jews to Beelzebul, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons (12:24, 27; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15, 18-19). In 9:34 the Pharisees, the leading ones of the Jewish religion, reviled the heavenly King by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons. In using this most blasphemous name, they expressed their strongest objection and rejection. ",
  "409":"God is the only One who is able to destroy both man's soul and man's body in Gehenna. This word implies that if the apostles sent by the Lord fail to suffer persecution, they will be disciplined by God. This discipline will take place in the coming age, after the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ, when the believers will receive reward or punishment (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12). ",
  "410":"See note 22 in ch. 5. ",
  "411":"An ancient Roman coin equal to one-sixteenth of a denarius. See note 7 in John 6. ",
  "412":"Implying his union with the Lord. ",
  "413":"Implying the Lord's union with him. ",
  "414":"This word was spoken by the heavenly King to His apostles, who were sent by Him to preach the gospel of the kingdom. He foretold that they would be persecuted (vv. 17, 21-23). If anyone under persecution denies Him, He will deny him at His coming back (16:27). Their being denied or confessed by Him at that time will determine whether His apostles are worthy to enter the kingdom of the heavens as a reward in the coming age. ",
  "415":"The whole earth is under Satan's usurpation (1 John 5:19). The heavenly King came to call some out from that usurpation. This certainly aroused Satan's opposition. He instigated the people under his usurpation to fight against the heavenly King's called ones. Thus, His coming did not bring peace but a sword. ",
  "416":"The fighting instigated by the usurping Satan against the heavenly King's called ones is waged even in their own household. The heavenly called ones are attacked in their homes by their kindred who remain under the evil one's usurping hand. ",
  "417":"Our love for the Lord must be absolute. We should love nothing above Him. He is the One most worthy of our love, and we must be worthy of Him. ",
  "418":"Christ took the Father's will and was crucified (26:39, 42). When He was baptized, He was counted as crucified, and from that time He bore His cross to do the will of God. His called ones were identified with Him. He asked them to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside. This demanded that at any cost they first give their love to Him that they might be worthy of Him. ",
  "419":"To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the heavenly King's followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King's sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King's joy in ruling over the earth (25:21, 23). ",
  "420":"The apostles sent by the heavenly King, having been entrusted with His authority (v. 1) and peace (v. 13), and having been indwelt by the Spirit of the Father and identified with the King in His suffering (vv. 22, 24-25) and death (vv. 21, 34-39), were one with Him. Thus, he who received them received Him. To participate in such an identification with the heavenly King requires us to love Him above all, at any cost, and to follow Him by taking the narrow way of the cross, as revealed in vv. 37-39. ",
  "421":"One who receives a prophet is joined to the prophet's word, and one who receives a righteous man is joined to the righteousness of the righteous man. Thus, these two will receive the reward of a prophet and of a righteous man, respectively. ",
  "422":"A prophet is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God. A righteous man is one who seeks after righteousness, who practices righteousness, and who is persecuted for the sake of righteousness for the kingdom (5:6, 10, 20; 6:1). The heavenly King was such, a Prophet sent by God (Deut. 18:15) and a righteous man (Acts 3:14). His apostles, sent by Him, were identified with Him and thus also were prophets and righteous men. Hence, whoever received them received Him and will receive a reward. ",
  "423":"This reward will be given in the coming kingdom age (Luke 14:14). ",
  "424":"John the Baptist's word here does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ. He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him. He knew that Christ was the Coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people (John 1:26-36). After that, John was put into prison (4:12), where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others. When John heard of this, it might have been that he was about to be stumbled (v. 6). Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ. ",
  "425":"The Greek word means a different one. ",
  "426":"The Lord mentioned first the blind's receiving of sight, because there had been no such miracle in the Old Testament. By this He gave clear evidence to John that none other than the Messiah could have done such a miracle (Isa. 35:5). In the spiritual sense also, the blind's receiving of sight comes first. In the Lord's salvation, first He opens our eyes (Acts 26:18); then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him. ",
  "427":"The lame signify those who cannot walk in God's way. After being saved, they can walk by a new life (9:5-6; John 5:8-9). ",
  "428":"See note 2 in ch. 8. ",
  "429":"The deaf signify those who cannot hear God. After being saved, they can hear the Lord's voice (John 10:27). ",
  "430":"The dead signify those who are dead in sins (Eph. 2:1, 5), unable to contact God. After being regenerated, they can fellowship with God by means of their regenerated spirit. ",
  "431":"The poor signify all who are without Christ and without God and who have no hope in the world (Eph. 2:12). Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ (2 Cor. 8:9; Eph. 3:8). ",
  "432":"This word implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled because of the Lord, because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way. Here the Lord encouraged him to take the way He had ordained for him, that he might be blessed. This blessing is very much related to participation in the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "433":"The Lord's reply to John implicitly indicated John's mistake. However, His words to the crowds concerning John explicitly testified for John. ",
  "434":"The Greek word means to view attentively. ",
  "435":"A reed signifies a weak and fragile person (12:20; 1 Kings 14:15). When John the Baptist was testifying for Christ in the wilderness, he was not such a weak person. ",
  "436":"The Greek word means perceive. So in the next verse. ",
  "437":"In the wilderness, while he was boldly testifying for Christ, John the Baptist was not a weak person who wore soft clothing. The Lord testified that he was neither a reed shaken by the wind nor a man arrayed in soft clothing. ",
  "438":"The Lord testified that John was much more than a prophet. ",
  "439":"Lit., less. All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. The kingdom people do. John could say only, \"Here is Christ,\" but the kingdom people can say, \"To me, to live is Christ\" (Phil. 1:21). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether a person is greater or lesser depends on his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor. The closer one is to Christ, the greater one is. ",
  "440":"This word indicates that up to that time the kingdom of the heavens had not come and that John the Baptist was not in it. ",
  "441":"From the days of John the Baptist until that time, the Pharisees were violently frustrating people from entering the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, those who desired to enter had to do so \"by violence.\" ",
  "442":"This proves that the Old Testament dispensation was terminated by the coming of John. ",
  "443":"Or, him. ",
  "444":"Malachi 4:5 prophesies that Elijah will come. When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). Hence, in a sense, John may be considered \"Elijah, who is to come\" (cf. 17:10-13). However, the prophecy of Mal. 4:5 will actually be fulfilled during the great tribulation, when the real Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God's people (Rev. 11:3-12). ",
  "445":"Christ and John the Baptist \"played the flute\" to preach the gospel of the kingdom, but the Jewish religionists did not \"dance\" for the joy of salvation; John and Christ \"sang a dirge\" to preach repentance, but the Jewish religionists did not mourn for the grief of sin. The righteousness of God demanded that they repent, but they would not obey; the grace of God afforded them salvation, but they would not receive it. ",
  "446":"John, coming to bring men to repentance (Mark 1:4) and to cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating and drinking (Luke 1:15-17); whereas Christ, coming to bring salvation to sinners and to cause them to rejoice in it, had the joy of eating and drinking with them (9:10-11). The kingdom people, who are under no regulation, follow the divine wisdom, concentrating on the indwelling Christ, who is their wisdom (1 Cor. 1:30), not on the outward manner of life. ",
  "447":"Because John the Baptist lived in a strange and peculiar way, not eating or drinking in the ordinary way, the opposers said, \"He has a demon,\" i.e., that he was demon possessed. ",
  "448":"See note 18. ",
  "449":"Christ is not only the Savior but also the Friend of sinners, who sympathizes with their problems and senses their grief. ",
  "450":"Wisdom is Christ (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Christ Himself. This wisdom was justified, vindicated, by His wise works, His wise deeds. ",
  "451":"Some ancient authorities read, children (see Luke 7:35). The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom. ",
  "452":"See note 15 in ch. 10. So in v. 24. ",
  "453":"Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament (Gen. 37:35; Psa. 6:5), is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept (Luke 16:22-23; Acts 2:27). ",
  "454":"While the Lord was rebuking the cities, He fellowshipped with the Father. At that time, answering the Father, He spoke to Him the extolment in vv. 25-26. ",
  "455":"Lit., acknowledge with extolment. The Lord acknowledged with extolment the Father's way in carrying out His economy. Although people, instead of responding to His ministry, slandered Him (vv. 16-19) and the leading cities rejected Him (vv. 20-24), He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father's will. He did not seek prosperity in His work but sought the Father's will; His satisfaction and rest were not in being understood and welcomed by man but in being known by the Father (vv. 26-27). ",
  "456":"In the Lord's extolling address, \"Father\" refers to the Father's relationship with Him, the Son, whereas \"Lord of heaven and of earth\" refers to God's relationship with the universe. When God's people were defeated by His enemy, God was called \"the God of heaven\" (Ezra 5:11-12; Dan. 2:18, 37). But when there was a man standing for Him on the earth, God was called \"the possessor of heaven and earth\" (Gen. 14:19, 22). Now the Lord as the Son of Man called the Father \"Lord of heaven and of earth,\" indicating that the Lord was standing on the earth for God's interest. ",
  "457":"The things regarding the knowledge of the Son and of the Father (v. 27). ",
  "458":"The wise and intelligent refers to the people of the three cities condemned in vv. 20-24, people who were wise and intelligent in their own eyes. The Father's will was to hide the knowledge of the Son and of the Father from such people. ",
  "459":"Infants refers to the disciples, who were the children of wisdom (see note 19). The Father was pleased to reveal both the Son and the Father to them. ",
  "460":"Lit., before You. ",
  "461":"All things refers to the remnant whom the Father has given to the Son (John 3:27; 6:37, 44, 65; 18:9). This word implies that the wise and intelligent rejected the Son because the Father was not pleased to give them to the Son. ",
  "462":"Full knowledge, not mere objective acquaintance. Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge, and concerning the Father, only the Son and he to whom the Son reveals Him have such knowledge. Hence, to know the Son requires that the Father reveal Him (16:17), and to know the Father requires that the Son reveal Him (John 17:6, 26). ",
  "463":"This refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened. After the Lord extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father's way and declaring the divine economy, He called this kind of people to come to Him for rest. ",
  "464":"Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law or religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction. ",
  "465":"Lit., lift. ",
  "466":"To take the Lord's yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will (26:39, 42). Hence, He asks us to learn from Him. ",
  "467":"To be meek, or gentle, means not to resist opposition, and to be lowly means not to have self-esteem. Throughout all the opposition the Lord was meek, and throughout all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, regardless of the situation He had rest in His heart; He was fully satisfied with His Father's will. ",
  "468":"The rest that we find by taking the Lord's yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest; it is not anything merely outward in nature. ",
  "469":"The Lord's yoke is the Father's will, and His burden is the work of carrying out the Father's will. Such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy. ",
  "470":"The Greek word means fit for use; hence, good, kind, mild, gentle, easy, pleasant &#151; in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, bitter. ",
  "471":"At that time joins this chapter to ch. 11. At the time the Lord was calling people to rest from striving to keep the law and religious regulations, He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to pick ears of grain and eat, seemingly breaking the Sabbath. ",
  "472":"The Sabbath was ordained so that the Jews would remember the completion of God's creation (Gen. 2:2), keep the sign of God's covenant made with them (Ezek. 20:12), and remember God's redemption accomplished for them (Deut. 5:15). Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees. To them it was not lawful, not scriptural. But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. Based on their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people. What folly to observe a vain ritual! ",
  "473":"The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord's disciples to pick the ears in the grainfields and to eat; thus, they condemned the disciples for acting contrary to the Scriptures. But the Lord answered, \"Have you not read ... ?\" pointing out to them another aspect of the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples. The Pharisees were thus condemned for lacking adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. ",
  "474":"The Lord's word here implies that He is the real David. In the ancient time David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presence (v. 4), seemingly breaking the Levitical law. Now the real David and His followers were rejected, and the disciples took action to pick ears of grain and eat, seemingly going against the sabbatical regulation. Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned. <br><br>   Furthermore, the Lord's word here implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In the ancient time the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests the leader of the people had to listen to the priest (Num. 27:21-22). But in the age of the kings the priest had to submit to the king (1 Sam. 2:35-36). Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal. Now the coming of Christ changed the dispensation again, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all. Whatever He does is right. ",
  "475":"Here the Lord pointed out to the Pharisees another case in the Scriptures, exposing how little they knew the Scriptures. ",
  "476":"The Lord revealed to the Pharisees that He was greater than the temple. This indicated another turn, a type-fulfilling turn from the temple to a person. In the case of David there was a turn from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple. Since the priests were guiltless in acting on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord's disciples be guilty in acting on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation. According to the Scriptures neither was guilty. Hence, scripturally, what the Lord did here was right. ",
  "477":"Here the Lord indicated the third turn, a right-asserting turn from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict. He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. He was above all rituals and regulations. Since He was there, no attention should have been paid to any ritual or regulation. ",
  "478":"This chapter records the Lord's move on two Sabbaths (Luke 6:1, 6). What He did on the first Sabbath indicates that He cared for Himself as the Head of the Body. As the Head, He is everything &#151; the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. What He did on the second Sabbath signifies that He cared for His members. On this Sabbath He healed a man's withered hand, likening this man to a sheep (vv. 11-12). The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is a member of the flock. The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep. Sabbath or no Sabbath, the Lord is interested in healing the dead members of His Body. To Him, regulations do not matter; the rescue of His fallen sheep means everything. ",
  "479":"The Lord gave the man the word, \"Stretch out your hand.\" In the Lord's word was the enlivening life. By stretching out his hand the man took the Lord's life-giving word, and his withered hand was restored by the life in His word. ",
  "480":"In the eyes of the religious Pharisees, for the Lord to break the Sabbath was to destroy God's covenant with the nation of Israel, that is, to destroy the relationship between God and Israel. Hence, they took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him. The breaking of the Sabbath caused the Jewish religionists to reject the heavenly King. ",
  "481":"The Greek word means boy attendant. ",
  "482":"Or, righteousness, (righteous) judgment. So in v. 20. ",
  "483":"This indicates clearly that because of the Jews' rejection, the heavenly King with His heavenly kingdom would turn to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles would receive Him and trust in Him (v. 21). ",
  "484":"The Jews were accustomed to making flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. Also, they made torches out of flax, which can burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked and they quenched it. Some of the Lord's people are like a bruised reed, which cannot give a musical sound; others are like smoking flax, which cannot produce a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones or quench the smoking ones. ",
  "485":"The Greek word refers to a torch made with flax. ",
  "486":"A blind and dumb man signifies one who is without spiritual sight, i.e., who is unable to see God and spiritual things, and who, for this reason, is unable to praise God and speak for God. This is the real condition of all fallen people. ",
  "487":"This indicates that they recognized Christ as their Messiah, their King. ",
  "488":"See note 25 in ch. 10. So in v. 27. ",
  "489":"Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority (Acts 26:18) and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and world-rulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13). ",
  "490":"The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. ",
  "491":"The kingdom of God, not the kingdom of the heavens, is indicated here. Even at that time the kingdom of the heavens still had not come. The kingdom of God, however, was there already. ",
  "492":"The house here signifies the kingdom of Satan. ",
  "493":"The strong man is Satan, the evil one. ",
  "494":"Or, instruments, apparatus; hence, goods, stuff. The fallen people, who are under Satan, are his vessels, his instruments, and are for his use. They are his goods, kept in his house, his kingdom. ",
  "495":"This indicates that when the Lord cast out demons, He first bound Satan. ",
  "496":"See note 40 in Mark 9. ",
  "497":"Blaspheming the Spirit differs from insulting the Spirit (Heb. 10:29). To insult the Spirit is to disobey Him willfully. Many believers do this. If they confess this sin, they will be forgiven and cleansed by the Lord's blood (1 John 1:7, 9). But to blaspheme the Spirit is to slander Him, as the Pharisees did in v. 24. It was by the Spirit that the Lord cast out a demon. But the Pharisees, seeing it, said that the Lord cast out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons. This was blasphemy against the Spirit. By such blasphemy the Pharisees' rejection of the heavenly King reached its climax. ",
  "498":"In the economy of the Triune God, the Father conceived the plan of redemption (Eph. 1:5, 9), the Son accomplished redemption according to the Father's plan (1 Pet. 2:24; Gal. 1:4), and the Spirit reaches sinners to apply the redemption accomplished by the Son (1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 1:2). If a sinner blasphemes the Son, as Saul of Tarsus did, the Spirit will still have the ground to work on him and cause him to repent and believe in the Son that he may be forgiven (see 1 Tim. 1:13-16). But if a sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work on him, and there will be no one left to cause him to repent and believe. Hence, it is impossible for such a person to be forgiven. This is not only logical according to reason but also governmental according to God's administrative principle, as revealed here by the Lord's word. ",
  "499":"In God's governmental administration His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: (1) this age, the present one, from Christ's first coming to His second coming; (2) the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ's second coming to the end of the old heaven and old earth; and (3) eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God's forgiveness in this age is for sinners' eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given to both sinners and believers. God's forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers' dispensational reward. If after being saved a believer commits a sin but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord's blood (1 John 1:7, 9) before he dies or the Lord comes back, the sin will not be forgiven in this age but will remain and will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). In such a case, the believer will not be rewarded with the kingdom, i.e., will not participate with Christ in the glory and joy in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined so that the sin is cleared, and will be forgiven in the coming age (18:23-35). This kind of forgiveness will maintain this believer's eternal salvation but will not qualify him to participate in the glory and joy of the coming kingdom. ",
  "500":"Lit., from. ",
  "501":"The Greek word means not working. An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, a word that has no positive function and is useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren. Those who have spoken such words will render an account concerning every one of them in the day of judgment. Since this is the case, how much more must we account for every wicked word! ",
  "502":"What a warning this is! We must learn to control and restrict our speaking. ",
  "503":"A sign is a miracle that has some spiritual significance. The Jews always seek signs (1 Cor. 1:22). ",
  "504":"Age in v. 32 refers to time; generation here refers to people. ",
  "505":"The heart of the earth is called \"the lower parts of the earth\" (Eph. 4:9) and Hades (Acts 2:27), where the Lord went after His death. Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament (see note 23 in ch. 11), has two sections, the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26). The section of comfort is Paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died on the cross (Luke 23:43). Hence, heart of the earth, lower parts of the earth, Hades, and Paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection. ",
  "506":"The Greek word for more, occurring also in v. 42, means better in quality and larger in quantity; hence, more. It differs from the word for greater in v. 6, which means greater in external size or measure. Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), is more than Jonah the prophet. Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After remaining there for three days, he came out to become a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the Gentiles and who would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation. ",
  "507":"See note 41. Christ, as the Son of David, as the King, is more than Solomon the king. Solomon built the temple of God and spoke the word of wisdom. To him the Gentile queen came (1 Kings 6:2; 10:1-8). This too was a type of Christ, who is building the church, making it the temple of God, and is speaking the word of wisdom. To Him the Gentile seekers turn. <br><br>   This type, and that in v. 41, indicate that Christ, whether as the Prophet sent by God or as the King anointed by God, would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in vv. 18 and 21. <br><br>   According to history King Solomon preceded Jonah the prophet. But according to spiritual significance Jonah came first, as recorded in Matthew. This too shows that Matthew's record is not according to the sequence of history but according to the sequence of doctrine (see note 16 par. 2, in ch. 8). According to doctrine, first Christ had to die and be resurrected; then He would build the church and speak the word of wisdom. Christ's death and resurrection are the real sign to this generation, to both the Jews and the Gentiles (1 Cor. 1:22, 24). ",
  "508":"The unclean spirit, a demon (v. 22), seeks rest but cannot find it in waterless places because the lodging place of demons, after God's judgment by water in Gen. 1:2, is the sea. (See Life-study of Genesis, Message Two.) Since a demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns to the human body that it originally possessed and settles down there (vv. 44-45). ",
  "509":"Doctrinally, v. 43 continues v. 22. Between these two verses is a record of the Jews' rejection of Christ and of Christ's forsaking of them. Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon possessed man. In the eyes of the Lord the rejecting Jews were like the demon possessed people. The signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent. They would only sweep away the dirt and decorate by adding good things to beautify themselves. They would not receive Christ and allow Him to fill them. Rather, they would remain empty and unoccupied. This is the actual condition of today's Jews. Near the end of this age they will be seven times more possessed by demons, and their state will become worse than ever. ",
  "510":"This indicates that the heavenly King forsook His relationship in the flesh with the Jews. In this chapter the Jews' rejection of Christ, having reached its climax, caused Christ to forsake them fully. At this point the break between them and Christ began, and they were severed from Christ (Rom. 11:17, 19-20). ",
  "511":"After breaking with the Jews, Christ turned to the Gentiles. Thenceforth His relationship with His followers was not in the flesh but in the spirit. Whoever does the will of His Father is a brother who helps Him, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him. ",
  "512":"At the end of ch. 12 the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the leaders of the Jewish religion, made a break with them. On that day He went out of the house and sat beside the sea. This is very significant. The house signifies the house of Israel (10:6), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (Dan. 7:3, 17; Rev. 17:15). The King's going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this, while on the seashore, that He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church. Hence, all the parables in this chapter were spoken to His disciples, not to the Jews. ",
  "513":"The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world. It was in the boat, in the church, that the King of the heavenly kingdom, after forsaking the Jews and turning to the Gentiles, revealed in parables the mysteries of the kingdom. ",
  "514":"In contrast to what He said in the other six parables (vv. 24, 31, 33, 44-45, 47), at the beginning of this parable, the first of the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord did not say, \"The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like ... ,\" because the kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable. In this first parable the Lord went out only to sow the seed for the kingdom. At that time the seed had not yet grown to be the crop for the formation of the kingdom. As the Lord said in His preaching at that time, the kingdom had not yet come but had only drawn near (4:17). ",
  "515":"The sower was the Lord Himself (v. 37). ",
  "516":"The seeds are the word of the kingdom (v. 19), the Lord being in this word as life. ",
  "517":"Beside the way refers to a place close to the way. It is hardened by the traffic of the way; thus, it is difficult for the seeds to penetrate it. The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and cannot open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom (v. 19). ",
  "518":"The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who comes and snatches away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart (v. 19). ",
  "519":"The rocky places that do not have much earth signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the word of the kingdom. Deep within such a heart are rocks &#151; hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity &#151; which hinder the seed from taking root in the depths of the heart. ",
  "520":"The sun with its scorching heat signifies affliction or persecution (v. 21). The scorching heat of the sun causes the seed that is not rooted to wither. The heat of the sun is for the growth and ripening of the crop, which take place once the seed has been deeply rooted. But because of the seed's lack of root, the sun's heat, which should cause growth and ripening, becomes a death blow to the seed. ",
  "521":"The thorns signify the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches, which utterly choke the word, preventing it from growing in the heart and causing it to become unfruitful (v. 22). ",
  "522":"The good earth signifies the good heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic, that is without hidden sins, and that is without the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches. Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold (v. 23). ",
  "523":"This word indicates that the opposing and rejecting Jews did not have ears to hear. Hence, they could not hear. ",
  "524":"The King of the heavenly kingdom used parables to reveal the things of the kingdom (v. 34) in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews so that they would not understand them. From the time the King came to sow the seed until He comes back to reap the harvest, everything concerning the kingdom is a mystery to the natural mind. Only the enlightened mind of a submissive heart can understand these mysteries. ",
  "525":"This is the receiver and follower of the heavenly King; to such a one the revelation concerning the kingdom will be given in abundance. ",
  "526":"This is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away. This is the real condition of the Jews today. They have no knowledge whatever concerning the kingdom of the heavens. It is altogether a mystery unknown to them. ",
  "527":"What a blessing it is to see and hear the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom! ",
  "528":"The evil one is the devil (vv. 38-39). ",
  "529":"In this, the second, parable the Lord began to say, \"The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...,\" because the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when this parable began to be fulfilled, i.e., on the day of Pentecost, when the church was built (16:18-19). It was from that time, after the church had been founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "530":"The men were the slaves (v. 27), referring to the Lord's slaves, mainly the apostles. It was when the Lord's slaves were sleeping and were not watching that the Lord's enemy, the devil, came and sowed false believers among the true. ",
  "531":"A tare is a kind of darnel, a weed resembling wheat. Its seeds are poisonous and can cause sleepiness, nausea, convulsions, and even death. The sprout and leaves of tares look the same as those of wheat. It is impossible to distinguish wheat from tares until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black. ",
  "532":"In the Old Testament the children of Israel, who were in the kingdom of God, were likened to grapes growing in the vineyard (21:33-34), whereas in the New Testament the kingdom people, who are in the kingdom of the heavens, are likened to wheat growing in the field. The vineyard was fenced, limited, and included only the Jews, whereas the field is worldwide, open, unlimited, and includes all peoples. ",
  "533":"Root out in order to collect. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "534":"Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field, and the field is the world (v. 38). The false believers and the true live in the world. To collect the tares from the field means to take away the false believers from the world. The Lord did not want His slaves to do this, because while taking away the false believers from the world, they might also take the true ones away. The Catholic Church did this very much and by so doing killed many true believers. ",
  "535":"To grow together in the world, not in the church. ",
  "536":"The fruit of the wheat in the first two parables and the fruit of the mustard seed here in the third parable are for food. This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and of the church, should be like a crop that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man. ",
  "537":"The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food. However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a \"tree,\" a lodging place for birds. (This is against the law of God's creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind &#151; Gen. 1:11-12.) This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this third parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in Rev. 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos (Rev. 2:12-17 &#151; see note 12 there). The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "538":"Since the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan (vv. 4, 19), the birds of heaven here must refer to Satan's evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them. They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom. ",
  "539":"In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (16:6, 11-12). ",
  "540":"The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. This fourth parable corresponds with the fourth of the seven churches in Rev. 2 and 3, the church in Thyatira (Rev. 2:18-29 &#151; see note 20 there). ",
  "541":"Meal, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food to both God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering (Lev. 2:4-5, 11). ",
  "542":"The kingdom people were chosen by God before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), but the mysteries of the kingdom were hidden from the foundation of the world. ",
  "543":"This parable discloses that not long after the kingdom was established through the building of the church, the situation of the kingdom of the heavens changed. The kingdom was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat. But the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation. Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance. The sons of the kingdom, the wheat, constitute the kingdom, whereas the sons of the evil one, the tares, have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom. ",
  "544":"The kingdom of the Son of Man, which is the earthly part of the millennium, the Messianic kingdom. ",
  "545":"The lake of fire (Rev. 20:10, 15). ",
  "546":"See note 12 in ch. 8. ",
  "547":"The sons of the kingdom (v. 38), who are the overcomers. ",
  "548":"The kingdom of the Father is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. ",
  "549":"The previous three parables, concerning the outward appearance of the kingdom, were spoken publicly by the heavenly King in a boat to the crowds (vv. 2, 34), whereas the three succeeding parables were given privately in a house to the disciples (v. 36). This indicates that the things covered by these latter three parables are more hidden. The first parable concerns a treasure hidden in the field. The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem (1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20). Since the church is the practical kingdom today, and since the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, the treasure hidden in the field must signify the kingdom hidden on God's created earth. ",
  "550":"The field is the earth created by God for His kingdom (Gen. 1:26-28). ",
  "551":"The man here is Christ, who found the kingdom of the heavens in 4:12--12:23, hid it in 12:24--13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1--27:52 to sell all that He had and to buy the field, i.e., redeem the created and lost earth, for the kingdom. ",
  "552":"The merchant also is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom. ",
  "553":"The pearl, produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner), and secreting its life-juice around the wounding rock (the believer &#151; see note 21 in Rev. 21), is material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value. ",
  "554":"Lit., dragnet. This parable corresponds with that in 25:32-46. The net here signifies not the gospel of grace, which is preached in the church age, but the eternal gospel, which will be preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation (Rev. 14:6-7 &#151; see note 6 there). ",
  "555":"The sea signifies the Gentile world. ",
  "556":"Every species signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles (25:32). ",
  "557":"The good are the \"sheep,\" who are justified; the foul are the \"goats,\" who are condemned (25:32). ",
  "558":"The lake of fire (25:41; Rev. 20:10, 15). ",
  "559":"See note 12 in ch. 8. ",
  "560":"After giving the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord likened the discipled scribe to a householder who has a treasure, a rich store of things new and old, signifying not only the new and old knowledge of the Scriptures but also the new and old experiences of life in the kingdom. ",
  "561":"In 12:24 the Pharisees opposed and rejected Christ to the uttermost. Here the Galileans knew Him according to the flesh, not according to the spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). They were blinded by their natural knowledge. ",
  "562":"The rejection by the Pharisees caused the heavenly King to forsake them. The unbelief of the Galileans caused the Lord not to do many works of power among them. ",
  "563":"I.e., are operating and are being manifested. ",
  "564":"In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost. This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them (12:46-50). Then in 13:53-58 He was rejected by the Galileans also. Now in ch. 14, Matthew, in his arranging of events according to doctrine, unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King's forerunner. It was evil and full of corruption and darkness. To this point Matthew has given a full picture of the Jews', the Galileans', and the Gentiles' rejection of the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "565":"Because He had been rejected by the people in religious, cultured, and political circles, the heavenly King departed from them and withdrew to a deserted place privately. This indicates that thenceforth He would hide Himself in a deserted place, in a place without culture, away from the religious, cultured, and political circles. He did this by means of a boat, implying that He would do this through the church. Because He has been rejected by the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always hidden Himself in a realm without much culture, away from religious and political circles. ",
  "566":"In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King. They did this by leaving their cities. It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place. Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world. ",
  "567":"Lit., passed. ",
  "568":"The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away so that the crowds could go to buy food for themselves (v. 15), but the Lord told the disciples to give the crowds something to eat. The disciples' concept was to ask people to do something; this is the principle of the law. But the Lord's concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace. ",
  "569":"In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit's intention in His inspiration is to show that what the followers of the heavenly King actually need is the proper food to satisfy their hunger. The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed. The heavenly King knew this and did something in a miraculous way to impress them with their real need and His provision for that need. All that they needed was His resurrection life, which would satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle. <br><br>   What the heavenly King did indicates strongly and clearly that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world. This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution saying that the kingdom people need not be anxious about what they will eat (6:31-33). ",
  "570":"John 6:9 tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves. Barley is a type of the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:10). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. Loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ's life, whereas fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ's life. For our spiritual hunger to be satisfied, we need Christ's generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both aspects are symbolized by small items &#151; loaves and fish. This indicates that in this age the heavenly King came to His followers not as a great King to reign over them but as small pieces of food to feed them. See note 9 in John 6. ",
  "571":"Whatever we have of the Lord should be brought to the Lord that it may become a great blessing to many others. Often the Lord uses what we offer to Him to provide for the need of many others. It is in this way that He provides for His followers' need today also. ",
  "572":"This was to put the people into good order and showed the Lord's wisdom and orderliness. ",
  "573":"By looking up to heaven the heavenly King indicated that His source was His Father who is in the heavens. ",
  "574":"Whatever we bring to the Lord must be broken that it may become a blessing to others. ",
  "575":"The loaves were from the disciples, who brought them to the Lord. After being blessed and broken by the Lord, the loaves were given back to the disciples for distribution to the crowds, to whom the loaves became a great satisfaction. This indicates that the disciples were not the source of blessing; they were only the channels used by the Lord, who is the source of the people's satisfaction. ",
  "576":"That there were twelve handbaskets full of broken pieces indicates not only that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible but also that the Lord's provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need. ",
  "577":"The Lord compelled the disciples to leave Him in order that He might have more time to pray privately to the Father (v. 23). ",
  "578":"Standing in the position of man (4:4), the heavenly King, as the beloved Son of the Father (3:17), needed to pray privately to His Father who was in the heavens, that He might be one with the Father and have the Father with Him in whatever He did on earth for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens. He did this not in the deserted place but on the mountain, leaving all the people, even His disciples, that He might be alone to contact the Father. ",
  "579":"Lit., evening. The time here is later than in v. 15. Thus, the word is rendered night here. ",
  "580":"Some ancient MSS read, was already many stadia away from the land. (A stadion is approximately 600 feet.) ",
  "581":"The Roman guards kept four night watches, each of three hours, from sunset to sunrise. The first watch was the evening watch, the second the midnight watch, the third the cockcrowing watch, and the fourth the morning watch (Mark 13:35). The fourth watch was probably from three to six o'clock in the morning. ",
  "582":"While His disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord walked on the sea. This testifies that He is the Creator and the Ruler of the universe (Job 9:8). ",
  "583":"Or, I am. ",
  "584":"Peter came down from the boat and walked on the water by faith in the Lord's word (v. 29); however, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished. He should have walked by faith in the Lord's word, not by looking at the circumstances (i.e., by sight). In following the Lord we should walk by faith, not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7). ",
  "585":"Since the Lord said to Peter, \"Come\" (v. 29), Peter should have stood on that word and should not have doubted. Hence, the Lord rebuked him. Faith comes from the Lord's word and stands on the Lord's word. As long as we have the Lord's word, we should simply believe in His word and not doubt. ",
  "586":"This miracle testifies not only that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth but also that He takes care of the hardships endured by His followers as they follow Him on the way. When we have the Lord in our boat, the wind ceases. The record of the two miracles in this chapter implies that during the time that Christ was being rejected by people in the religious and political circles, He and His followers were in a deserted place and on a stormy sea. Whatever the situation, He was able to provide for their need and carry them through the hardships. ",
  "587":"To recognize that the Lord is the Son of God is to realize that He is equal to God (John 5:18). This indicates that the disciples acknowledged the Lord's divinity (1:23; 3:17). ",
  "588":"See note 20 in ch. 9. ",
  "589":"Lit., saved. ",
  "590":"Although the Lord forsook the rejecting religionists, they still would not cease troubling Him. They came to Him from their religious center, Jerusalem, in order to find fault with Him. However, their troubling afforded Him another opportunity to reveal the truth concerning genuine cleanness (vv. 10-11, 15-20). ",
  "591":"This reveals that in following the Lord the disciples did not keep traditions. They cared only for the heavenly King's presence, not for anything else. ",
  "592":"The Jewish religionists accused the Lord's disciples of transgressing their tradition, but the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition. They cared for their tradition, but they ignored God's commandment. In principle, the religious people today do the same thing. The Roman Catholic Church and most Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions. ",
  "593":"The Lord's dealing here with the Pharisees and scribes not only condemned them for making void the word of God because of their tradition but also implied that man should honor his parents. God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents. He has made this the first commandment among the ten commandments that concerns human relationships (Exo. 20:12). Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God's government. In order to bring man back to God's government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents. This corresponds with His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law (5:17-19). Hence, the apostle also emphasized this matter strongly (Eph. 6:1-3; Col. 3:20). We, the kingdom people, must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did. To make any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling but are following our fallen nature and the rebellious trend of today's generation. ",
  "594":"Or, slanders, insults. ",
  "595":"Lit., decease by death; meaning to die by being put to death. The Greek word for decease means come to one's end. Hence, this phrase means come to one's end by being put to death. It is quoted from two verses in the Septuagint &#151; Exo. 21:17 and Lev. 20:9. In those two verses it was translated from the Hebrew idiom. ",
  "596":"An offering to God. ",
  "597":"See note 2 in ch. 6. ",
  "598":"The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice. Such ruling deals with the real condition of the heart, not with the expression of the lips.",
  "599":"This reveals that some worship offered to God may be in vain. The main cause of this is to consider as teachings the commandments of men. We must worship God according to His word, which is the truth. ",
  "600":"I.e., makes the man common, unclean (Acts 11:8). So in vv. 18 and 20. In the kingdom life, defilement is not an outward matter but an inward matter. ",
  "601":"This word from the heavenly King indicates that the hypocritical Pharisees had not been planted by the heavenly Father. Because of their rejection of the heavenly King, they were uprooted from the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "602":"The self-righteous and arrogant religionists thought that they were clear concerning the way to serve God, not realizing that they were blind guides of the blind. Their eyes were veiled by their religion with their traditions; hence, they could not see the reality of God's economy and thus were not able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Their blindness led them to \"fall into a pit.\" ",
  "603":"In the kingdom of the heavens, defilement is not related to material things but to moral matters. Material things have nothing to do with the heavenly ruling, but moral matters do. That so many evils issue from our heart proves that we are not under the heavenly ruling. ",
  "604":"The further troubling by the rejecting religionists caused the heavenly King to depart farther from them, even into the districts of Tyre and Sidon, into a Gentile land. ",
  "605":"Because of the rejection by the religious Jews, the opportunity to contact the heavenly King came to the Gentiles, even to a weak Gentile woman. ",
  "606":"The title Lord implies Christ's divinity, and the title Son of David, His humanity. It was proper for this woman, a Gentile, to address Christ as \"Lord.\" However, she had no right to call Him \"Son of David\"; only the children of Israel were privileged to do so. ",
  "607":"The Lord was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. However, at this time He came to a Gentile region, thus affording the Gentiles an opportunity to participate in His grace. This bears dispensational significance, showing that Christ came to the Jews first and that because of their unbelief, His salvation turned to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46; Rom. 11:11). ",
  "608":"As she would worship God. ",
  "609":"This second time she addressed Christ only as \"Lord,\" not as \"Son of David,\" because she realized that she was not a child of Israel but a heathen. ",
  "610":"The heavenly King's ministry in all His visits created opportunities for Him to reveal Himself further. In the situations created in chs. 9 and 12, He had opportunities to reveal Himself as the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new wine, the Shepherd, the real David, the greater temple, the Lord of the harvest, the One who is more than Jonah, and the One who is more than Solomon. Here another opportunity was created for Him to reveal Himself, this time as the children's bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord &#151; a divine person &#151; and the Son of David &#151; a royal descendant, great and high in His reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. This implies that as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread. We can be the proper people in His kingdom only by being nourished with Him as our food. To eat Christ as our supply is the way to be the kingdom people in the reality of the kingdom. ",
  "611":"This indicates that in the eyes of the Lord all the heathen are dogs, which are unclean in the eyes of God (Lev. 11:27). ",
  "612":"The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord's word but admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, had come as a portion to the children of Israel. But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile land, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles. What a realization this Gentile woman had at that time! No wonder the heavenly King admired her faith (v. 28). ",
  "613":"Because He had been rejected by the Jewish religion, the Lord remained in Galilee of the Gentiles as the healing light. He would not go to Jerusalem, the Jews' religious center, to heal the Jews (13:15). ",
  "614":"Lit., cast. ",
  "615":"Christ would not allow His followers to hunger and faint on the way while they followed Him. ",
  "616":"Even in the barren wilderness the Lord was able to feed His followers and satisfy them, regardless of how many there were. The disciples had experienced this before, in 14:15-21; however, it seems that they had not learned the lesson of faith. Here they set their eyes on the environment instead of on the Lord. Yet the Lord's presence was better than a rich store. ",
  "617":"The Lord always wants to use what we have to bless others. ",
  "618":"If we offer all that we have to the Lord, He will take it, break it, and give it back to us for distribution to others, to whom it will become a satisfying and overflowing blessing (v. 37). Whatever we offer to the Lord, however little it is, will be multiplied by His blessing hand to meet the need of a great multitude (v. 38); thereby His desire is fulfilled (v. 32). ",
  "619":"See note 38 in ch. 12. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "620":"The words from this point to the end of v. 3 are omitted by some ancient authorities. ",
  "621":"I.e., appearance. ",
  "622":"See note 56 in Luke 12. ",
  "623":"Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After remaining there for three days, he emerged to become a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). He was a type of Christ, who, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days, and would then be resurrected, becoming a sign to that generation for salvation. The Lord's word here implies that for that evil and adulterous Jewish and religious generation, the Lord would do nothing but die and be resurrected as a sign, the greatest sign, to them that they might be saved if they would believe. ",
  "624":"From 15:1 through 16:12 Matthew's record is very much concerned with the matter of eating. Eating unclean things may defile us. Eating is the way to partake of Christ (15:21-28), and by eating we feed on the unlimited and inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ (15:32-39). But we must beware of eating any leaven (vv. 5-12). ",
  "625":"A basket used for a journey. ",
  "626":"Larger than the handbaskets in v. 9. ",
  "627":"Referring to the things taught. The teaching of the Pharisees was hypocritical (23:13, 15, 23, 25, 27, 29), and the teaching of the Sadducees, which denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits (Acts 23:8), was like today's modernism. Hence, both the teaching of the Pharisees and the teaching of the Sadducees were impure and evil and were likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God's people (Exo. 13:7). ",
  "628":"In the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon, on which the Lord was transfigured (17:1-2). It was far from the holy city and the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man's thought, leaving no room for Christ, the new King. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with its clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which are the pulse of His heavenly kingdom. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (vv. 16-17). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 18-19). ",
  "629":"As a man, Christ was a mystery to that generation, as He is to people today. ",
  "630":"Without heavenly revelation people can realize, at most, only that Christ is the greatest among the prophets; no one can know that He is the Christ, the Son of the living God (v. 16). ",
  "631":"The Christ refers to the One concerning whom God prophesied in the Old Testament through the prophets and whom His saints through the ages looked for (John 1:41, 45; Luke 2:25-26; 3:15), the One who would come to accomplish the will of God (Heb. 10:5-7). <br><br>   The Christ, referring to the anointed One of God, speaks of the Lord's commission, whereas the Son of the living God, referring to the Second of the Triune God, speaks of His person. His commission is to accomplish God's eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second coming, whereas His person embodies the Father and consummates in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God. ",
  "632":"The living God is in contrast to dead religion. The Lord is the embodiment of the living God, having nothing to do with dead religion. ",
  "633":"I.e., son of Jonah. ",
  "634":"Flesh and blood refers to the natural man, who was created and became fallen. ",
  "635":"Only the Father knows the Son (11:27); hence, only He can reveal the Son to us. ",
  "636":"The Father's revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). Hence, the Lord needed to reveal to Peter the second half also, which concerns the church. ",
  "637":"Or, a stone; material for God's building (1 Pet. 2:5). ",
  "638":"This rock refers not only to Christ but also to this revelation concerning Christ, a revelation that Peter received from the Father. The church is built on Christ and on this revelation concerning Christ. ",
  "639":"The Lord's building of His church began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 41-42). Yet the Lord's prophecy here still has not been fulfilled, even up to the twentieth century. The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations. This prophecy is being fulfilled through the Lord's recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is being accomplished. ",
  "640":"Gk. ekklesia, meaning an out-calling. This word is used in reference to a called-out congregation. My church indicates that the church is of the Lord, not of any other person or thing; it is not like the denominations, which are denominated according to some person's name or according to some matter. ",
  "641":"Gates of Hades refers to Satan's authority or power of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18), which cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ upon this revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed human being. This word of the Lord's indicates also that Satan's power of darkness will attack the church. Hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan's power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God's kingdom. ",
  "642":"According to history there were two keys. Peter used one on the day of Pentecost to open the gate so that the Jewish believers could enter the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 2:38-42), and he used the other in the house of Cornelius to open the gate so that the Gentile believers could enter (Acts 10:34-48). ",
  "643":"Kingdom of the heavens is used here interchangeably for church, which is used in the previous verse. This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. This is confirmed by Rom. 14:17, in which the kingdom of God is mentioned in obvious reference to the proper church life. ",
  "644":"This Gospel is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom with its reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself (18:17-18). ",
  "645":"Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be something that has already been bound or loosed in the heavens. We can bind or loose only what has already been bound or loosed in the heavens. ",
  "646":"The revelation concerning Christ with His church is always hidden from religious people. ",
  "647":"After the revelation of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ were unveiled. In order for Christ to build His church, He had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection. ",
  "648":"The natural man is never willing to take the cross. ",
  "649":"Christ perceived that it was not Peter but Satan who was frustrating Him from taking the cross. This reveals that our natural man, which is not willing to take the cross, is one with Satan. ",
  "650":"Or, You are a snare to Me. ",
  "651":"When we are setting our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, we become Satan, a stumbling block to the Lord on His way to fulfill God's purpose. ",
  "652":"To deny our self is to forfeit our soul-life, the natural life (v. 26; Luke 9:25). ",
  "653":"Three terms in vv. 23-25 are related to one another: mind, himself, and soul-life. Our mind is the expression of our self, and our self is the embodiment of our soul-life. Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Hence, the Lord's subsequent word indicated that Peter had to deny himself, i.e., not save his soul-life but lose it. Losing the soul-life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross. ",
  "654":"The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, first were crucified with Him and now bear the cross. To us, to bear the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man. In so doing we deny our self that we may follow the Lord. ",
  "655":"Before the Lord's crucifixion the disciples followed Him in an outward way. But now, after His resurrection, we follow Him in an inward way. Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), we follow Him in our spirit (Gal. 5:16-25). ",
  "656":"Or, destroy. ",
  "657":"See note 39 in ch. 10. ",
  "658":"In Luke 9:24-25 soul-life is replaced with himself, indicating that our soul-life is our self. ",
  "659":"For indicates that the Lord's rewarding of His followers at His coming back, as mentioned in this verse, will be according to whether they lose or save their soul, as mentioned in vv. 25-26. ",
  "660":"This will take place at the judgment seat of Christ when He comes back (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12). ",
  "661":"This was fulfilled by the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain (17:1-2). His transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom. It was seen by His three disciples &#151; Peter, James, and John. ",
  "662":"The record from 13:53--17:8 portrays the way to follow the heavenly King, from His rejection to the entering of the manifestation of the kingdom. His followers not only shared His being rejected by the Jews (13:53-58) but also were persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics (14:1-12). They were in a deserted place with Him in a situation of poverty, yet they were richly cared for by Him (14:13-21). When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through (14:22-34). At that point many sick ones were healed by touching Him (14:35-36), but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to heckle Him because His followers transgressed their tradition (15:1-20). Then His disciples followed Him to a Gentile region, where a demon possessed Gentile was healed (15:21-28). After that, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where all kinds of sick people were healed and the need of His followers and the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren wilderness (15:29-39). After that, both the fundamentalists and the modernists of that day came to tempt Him, and He indicated that He would die to be a unique sign to them (16:1-4). Then He charged His followers to beware of the leaven of both the fundamentalists and the modernists (16:5-12). After all that, He brought His followers to the border of the Holy Land, close to a Gentile land, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom (16:13-28). Finally, He brought them into glory in the manifestation of the kingdom (vv. 1-8). ",
  "663":"Since the Lord's transfiguration occurred six days after the revelations (given at the foot of Mount Hermon) in ch. 16 concerning Christ and the church, the high mountain here must be Mount Hermon. To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church, we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ, we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level. ",
  "664":"Lit., transformed. ",
  "665":"Moses died and God hid his body (Deut. 34:5-6); Elijah was taken by God into heaven (2 Kings 2:11). God purposely did these two things that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration. They were preserved by God so that they could be the two witnesses in the great tribulation (Rev. 11:3-4). Moses represented the law, and Elijah, the prophets; and the law and the prophets were the constituents of the Old Testament as a full testimony of Christ (John 5:39). Now Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Christ concerning His death (Luke 9:31), which had been spoken of in the Old Testament (Luke 24:25-27, 44; 1 Cor. 15:3). ",
  "666":"In his absurd proposal, Peter put Moses and Elijah on the same level as Christ; i.e., he made the law and the prophets equal with Christ. This was absolutely against God's economy. In God's economy the law and the prophets are only a testimony of Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him. ",
  "667":"This declaration of the Father, given to vindicate the Son, was first spoken after Christ's rising from baptism, which signified His resurrection from the dead. This was the second time the Father made this declaration, this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration, which prefigures the coming kingdom. ",
  "668":"In God's economy, after Christ came, we should hear Him; we should no longer hear the law or the prophets, since the law and the prophets were fulfilled in and by Christ. ",
  "669":"Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, i.e., the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself. The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ. Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today's Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers. Jesus is also today's Elijah; as such, He speaks for God and speaks forth God within His believers. This is God's New Testament economy. ",
  "670":"The vision of the transfigured, glorified Jesus can be seen clearly only in the resurrection of Christ. ",
  "671":"This was according to Mal. 4:5-6. ",
  "672":"This will be fulfilled at the time of the great tribulation, when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:3-4), as prophesied in Mal. 4:5-6. ",
  "673":"This refers to John the Baptist (v. 13), who came in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:13-17) and was rejected (11:18) and beheaded (14:3-12). ",

  "677":"A Jewish poll tax for the temple, equal to a half-shekel (Exo. 30:12-16; 38:26). ",
  "678":"On the Mount of Transfiguration Peter heard the voice from heaven, which charged him to hear Christ (17:5). If he had still remembered that word, he would have referred the poll tax gatherers' question to Christ to hear what He would say. But he answered instead of listening to what Christ would say. ",
  "679":"Peter had spoken presumptuously. Hence, the Lord stopped him and corrected him before he began to speak to Him. ",
  "680":"The sons of kings are always free from paying custom or poll tax. The half-shekel was paid by God's people for His temple. Since Christ was the Son of God, He was free from paying it. This was contrary to Peter's answer concerning this matter. <br><br>   Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ's being the Son of God (16:16-17) and had seen the vision of the Son of God (v. 5). Now, in application of what he had seen, he was put to the test by the poll tax gatherers' question. He failed in his answer because he forgot the revelation that he had received and the vision that he had seen. He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God, who, as such, did not need to pay the poll tax for His Father's house. ",
  "681":"After shutting Peter's mouth, the Lord, as the New Testament Prophet, today's Elijah, told him to go fishing and that in so doing he would find a stater. This prophecy was fulfilled. Peter was no doubt troubled that he had to go fishing and wait for a fish to appear with a stater. ",
  "682":"Equal to one shekel. ",
  "683":"After convincing Peter that He did not need to pay the half-shekel, the Lord, as the New Testament Lawgiver, today's Moses, commanded Peter to pay it for Him. The Lord did this purposely to teach Peter that in God's New Testament economy He is the unique One; neither Moses nor Elijah nor Peter nor anyone else has the position to speak or to give the command. ",
  "684":"While the Lord was correcting and teaching Peter, He took care of his need. This is always the Lord's way in dealing with us. ",
  "685":"This chapter deals with the way we should live and act in the kingdom of the heavens: (1) we should become like little children (vv. 2-4); (2) we should not stumble others or set up any stumbling block (vv. 5-9); (3) we should not despise even a little believer (vv. 10-14); (4) we should hear the church and not be condemned by it (vv. 15-20); and (5) we should forgive a brother without limit (vv. 21-35). All this indicates that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we must be humble and not despise any believer, but love our brother and forgive our brother. ",

  "697":"The church revealed in 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality. Chapter 16 concerns the building of the universal church, whereas this chapter concerns the practice of the local church. In both of its aspects the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose. ",
  "698":"If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile (the heathen) and the tax collector (the sinner), who are outside the fellowship of the church. ",
  "699":"Here to bind means to condemn, and to loose means to forgive. ",
  "700":"See note 19 in ch. 16. ",
  "701":"As musical sounds are in harmony. ",
  "702":"Strictly, ask here refers to prayer that deals with the brother who refuses to hear the church (v. 17). ",
  "703":"Lit., it will be unto them. ",
  "704":"These two or three are the two or three in v. 16. They are gathered together into the Lord's name, but they are not the church; for v. 17 says that if there is some problem, they need to tell it to the church. ",
  "705":"The meetings of the believers are initiated by the Lord, who calls the believers out of all persons, matters, and things that occupy them and gathers them together into His name to enjoy the riches of His presence. <br><br>   Such a gathering of a few people, of two or three, implies one of the ways for the church to meet locally. Such meetings of a few people must have been held in the believers' homes, as mentioned in Acts 2:46 and 5:42, for the purpose of prayer (v. 19; Acts 12:5, 12), fellowship, the breaking of bread, teaching, or the preaching of the gospel (Acts 2:42; 5:42). Many such meetings may be held separately in the same locality, yet they are still the unique church in that locality (v. 17). Otherwise, they are not separate meetings but divisions, and they become sects (Gal. 5:20). ",
  "706":"Lit., a man, a king. ",
  "707":"This refers to the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). ",
  "708":"Such a large amount indicates that it was impossible for the debtor to pay off the debt. This refers to the heavy debt of our sins against the Lord accumulated after we are saved. ",
  "709":"This refers to the forgiveness of our debts incurred after we are saved and become slaves of the Lord. ",
  "710":"Less than one ten thousandth of ten thousand talents. It refers to a sin committed against us by a brother after we are saved and become slaves of the Lord. ",
  "711":"Our not forgiving the brother who sins against us will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord. ",
  "712":"This refers to the Lord's dealing with His believers at His coming back. If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, i.e., until we repay all that is owed. Then the Lord will forgive us. This is forgiveness in the kingdom. This implies that if we do not forgive a brother from our heart today, we will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom in the coming age. See note 32 in ch. 12. ",
  "713":"The religionists did not let the Lord go but came again and again to test Him. However, their testing always afforded the Lord an opportunity to unveil Himself and God's economy. ",
  "714":"Lit., release. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "715":"From here to the end of v. 6, the Lord's word not only acknowledged God's creation of man but also confirmed God's ordination regarding man's marriage, that is, that one male and one female are to be joined and yoked together as one flesh and are not to be separated by man. ",
  "716":"This commandment was not a part of the basic law but was a supplement to the law. It was given by Moses not according to God's ordination from the beginning but as something temporary, because of the hardness of man's heart. ",
  "717":"The commandment given by Moses concerning divorce was a deviation from God's original ordination concerning marriage, but for the kingdom of the heavens Christ as the heavenly King recovered marriage back to the beginning. This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens, which corresponds with God's ordination from the beginning, does not allow divorce. ",
  "718":"Lit., harlotry, whoredom. This is worse than adultery. The Lord's word here indicates definitely that nothing but fornication breaks the marriage tie. (Of course, death breaks it spontaneously.) Hence, except for fornication there is no excuse for divorce. ",
  "719":"The words from here to the end of the verse are omitted by some ancient authorities. ",
  "720":"At that point the disciples realized that according to God's ordination, marriage is the strictest bond. Once a person is married, he is fully bound, having no way to be released except through the committing of fornication by the spouse (or through the death of the spouse). It was such a realization that caused the disciples to think that it was not profitable to marry. But it was not under their control. ",
  "721":"Not all men, but only those to whom God has given the gift, are able to refrain from marriage. Without God's gift, anyone who attempts to remain unmarried will meet with temptations. ",
  "722":"Lit., have room for. ",
  "723":"These are the ones to whom God has given the gift to remain unmarried for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. Paul was such a one (1 Cor. 7:7-8; 9:5). ",
  "724":"The religionists' temptation here afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal a further matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens. Chapter 18 reveals how we must deal with the brothers so that we can enter into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas this chapter reveals that marriage life (vv. 3-12) and our attitude toward riches (vv. 16-30) are related to the kingdom of the heavens. Marriage life touches the matter of lust, and our attitude toward riches touches the matter of covetousness. The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness. ",
  "725":"Here the Lord stressed again that to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be like little children. ",
  "726":"Having eternal life as spoken of in Matthew differs from having eternal life as spoken of in John. Matthew is concerned with the kingdom, whereas John is concerned with life. In John, to have eternal life is to be saved by God's uncreated life that we may live by that life today and for eternity; but in Matthew, to have eternal life is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age by God's eternal life and to share in the kingdom's manifestation in the coming age, thereby enjoying God's eternal life in a fuller way. ",
  "727":"This One is God. Only God is good. This indicates not only that the young man asking the question was not good but also that the Lord Jesus is God, who is good. If He were not God, He too would not be good. ",
  "728":"Lit., the good. ",
  "729":"Here to enter into life means to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 23). The kingdom of the heavens is a realm of God's eternal life. Hence, when we enter into it, we enter into God's life. This differs from being saved. To be saved is to have God's life enter into us to be our life, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God's life to enjoy the riches of God's life. The former is to be redeemed and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, whereby we receive God's life; the latter is to live and walk by God's life. One is a matter of life; the other is a matter of living. See note 16. ",
  "730":"This is not the requirement for salvation; it is related to entering into the kingdom of the heavens. According to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens requires us to meet not only the standard of the old law but also the standard of the complemented new law given by the King (5:17-48). Salvation requires only faith, whereas the kingdom of the heavens requires the surpassing righteousness that issues from the keeping of the old law and the complemented law given by the heavenly King. ",
  "731":"Even though the young man had observed the commandments of the old law &#151; or so he assumed &#151; he still was not perfect, not up to the standard of the requirement of the complemented new law, for he was not willing to sell what he had and store up treasure in heaven, as the constitution of the kingdom required (6:19-21). ",
  "732":"To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things (10:37-38). This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "733":"Loving material possessions above the Lord causes one to sorrow, but those who love Christ above all things accept with joy the loss of their possessions (Heb. 10:34). ",
  "734":"The Lord's word here indicates the impossibility of entering into the kingdom of God by our natural life. ",
  "735":"Verse 23 uses kingdom of the heavens, but here kingdom of God is used. At this point the kingdom of the heavens had not come, but the kingdom of God was there. Hence, the Lord used the term kingdom of God. ",
  "736":"As most Christians do today, the disciples confused salvation with entering into the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord's word to the young man concerned entering into the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 23-24), but the disciples thought that it referred to salvation. Their concept of salvation was natural and common. They did not grasp the Lord's revelation concerning entering into the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "737":"By our human life it is impossible to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but it is possible by God's divine life, which is Christ Himself imparted into us so that we can live the kingdom life. By Christ, who empowers us to do all things (Phil. 4:13), we can fulfill the requirements of the kingdom. ",
  "738":"This is the restoration in the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21), after the Lord's second coming. ",
  "739":"In the coming kingdom the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (Rev. 20:4). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, and the other overcomers will rule over the nations (Rev. 2:26). ",
  "740":"To receive a hundred times as many houses, fields, and relatives is to be rewarded in this age (Mark 10:30). This refers to our enjoyment today of brothers and sisters in the Lord, with their possessions. ",
  "741":"Some ancient authorities read, manifold. ",
  "742":"To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30), in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age. ",
  "743":"See note 16 in ch. 20. ",
  "744":"For indicates that the parable in vv. 1-16 is an explanation of 19:30. ",
  "745":"Denoting Christ, who is the householder. ",
  "746":"Morning here is 6:00 a.m., denoting the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom. ",
  "747":"The workmen denote the disciples. ",
  "748":"The vineyard denotes the kingdom. ",
  "749":"Referring to the agreement the Lord made in 19:27-29. ",
  "750":"See note 7 in John 6. The denarius here denotes the reward the Lord offered Peter in His agreement with him in 19:27-29. ",
  "751":"Hebrew time; so in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts. This is 9:00 a.m., denoting the second part of the church age. ",
  "752":"This word indicates that whoever does not work in the kingdom of the heavens is standing idle in the world. ",
  "753":"The marketplace denotes the world. ",
  "754":"12:00 noon, denoting the middle part of the church age. ",
  "755":"3:00 p.m., denoting the fourth part of the church age. ",
  "756":"5:00 p.m., denoting the fifth part of the church age. So in v. 9. ",
  "757":"Outside the kingdom of God, no human beings are employed by God. ",
  "758":"Even near the end of the church age the Lord still calls people. ",
  "759":"6:00 p.m., denoting the end of the church age. ",
  "760":"This is against the natural and commercial concept. It indicates that the wages paid to the last workmen are not according to their work but according to the gracious wish of the Lord of the vineyard. ",
  "761":"These first workmen included Peter, who made a deal with the Lord in 19:27-29. ",
  "762":"They did not know Rom. 9:14-15, 20. There is no unrighteousness with the Lord. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. Who were they to reply against the Lord? ",
  "763":"Peter's natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord's gracious wish. ",
  "764":"By one of them, the Lord was referring undoubtedly to Peter. ",
  "765":"Lit., comrade, companion, partner. ",
  "766":"Denoting the agreement the Lord made with Peter in 19:27-29. ",
  "767":"This was a strong answer to Peter from the Lord, indicating that the Lord had given him what he thought he deserved. But the Lord has the right to give the same wages to the last workmen according to His own wish, in the principle not of work but of grace. This shattered Peter's natural and commercial mind and corrected his concept. ",
  "768":"In dealing with the Lord in 19:27, Peter's concept was altogether commercial, according to the principle of work, not grace. In His answer to Peter, the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not a commercial matter but a matter according to His desire and grace. For the disciples to gain the kingdom of the heavens, they needed to leave all and follow the Lord; but what He will give them as a reward is more than they deserve. It is not according to the principle of commerce but according to the Lord's good pleasure. This is an incentive to His followers. ",
  "769":"Cf. note 22 in Mark 7. ",
  "770":"The last are the latest workmen, and the first are the earliest ones. In working, the earliest come first, but in receiving the reward, the last become the first. It is in this way that the Lord makes the last first and the first last. ",
  "771":"This was the third time the Lord revealed His death to the disciples. The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration (16:13, 21). The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration (17:22). This third time was on the way to Jerusalem. This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples; yet it would be fulfilled literally, in every detail. ",
  "772":"John and James. ",
  "773":"If we ask to sit on the throne in the kingdom, we must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering. To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom (Acts 14:22). The selfish entreaty of the mother of John and James afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom. ",
  "774":"Standing in the position of man, the Lord was fully subject to the Father; He did not assume the right to do anything outside the Father. ",
  "775":"This is absolutely contrary to the natural, self-seeking mind. The indignation of the ten disciples (v. 24) also afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to live in the kingdom: to be willing to serve others as a servant, even as a slave (v. 27), rather than rule over others. ",
  "776":"See note 26. ",
  "777":"In this book, the book on the kingdom, the Lord stood always in the position of man. Although the kingdom of the heavens is constituted with the divine life, it is carried out in humanity. ",
  "778":"Lit., soul, soul-life. ",
  "779":"The royal title of Christ for the children of Israel. See note 22 in ch. 15. ",
  "780":"They began the journey from Galilee in 19:1. They were on the way in 20:17 and passed through Jericho in 20:29. Now they came to the Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem. ",
  "781":"This indicates that the Lord is omniscient. ",
  "782":"This indicates that Christ is the Lord of all. ",
  "783":"This clause differs from the corresponding clause in Mark 11:3b. ",
  "784":"Denoting the people of Jerusalem (cf. Psa. 137:8; 45:12). ",
  "785":"Signifying the humble and lowly state in which the King of the heavenly kingdom was willing to remain. ",
  "786":"Garments signify the human virtues in people's conduct. The disciples honored the lowly King by putting their garments on the donkey and the colt for Him to ride on, and the crowd honored Him by spreading their garments in the road for Him to pass through (v. 8). ",
  "787":"The branches of the palm tree (John 12:13), which signify the victorious life (Rev. 7:9) and the satisfaction of enjoying the rich produce of that life, as typified by the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15). The crowd used both their garments and the palm tree branches to celebrate the lowly King's coming. ",
  "788":"A Hebrew word meaning save now (Psa. 118:25). ",
  "789":"The royal title of the lowly King. ",
  "790":"The stubborn chief priests and scribes were indignant, even after they saw the wonders the lowly King performed. Their indignation was due to their pride and jealousy, which blinded them from seeing any vision concerning the heavenly King. ",
  "791":"In His last visit to Jerusalem the Lord remained there only during the day for His ministry. Every evening He departed to lodge in Bethany, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (Mark 11:19; Luke 21:37), where the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon were (John 11:1; Matt. 26:6). In Jerusalem He was rejected by the leaders of Judaism, but in Bethany He was welcomed by His lovers. ",
  "792":"This signified that the Lord was hungry for fruit from the children of Israel, that God might be satisfied. ",
  "793":"The fig tree here is a symbol of the nation of Israel (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8). This tree was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show but had nothing that could satisfy God. ",
  "794":"This signifies the curse on the nation of Israel. ",
  "795":"From that time the nation of Israel was truly dried up. ",
  "796":"Lit., word. ",
  "797":"This was a lie. ",
  "798":"This indicated that the Lord knew that the Jewish leaders would not tell Him what they knew; hence, neither would He tell them what they asked. They lied to the Lord in saying, \"We do not know.\" But the Lord spoke the truth wisely to them, exposing their lie and avoiding their question. ",
  "799":"In Luke 15:1-2, 11-32, the Lord likened the leaders of Judaism to the firstborn son, and the tax collectors and sinners to the second son; but here the Lord likened them in the opposite order. This indicates that the Jews were the firstborn of God (Exo. 4:22) and had the birthright. However, because of their unbelief the birthright was shifted to the church, which has become God's firstborn (Heb. 12:23). ",
  "800":"The Gospel of Matthew, as the book on the kingdom, stresses the matter of righteousness, for the kingdom life is one of strict righteousness, which we must seek (5:20, 6; 6:33). John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness (3:15). ",
  "801":"The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 5:1), and the vinedressers are the leaders of the Israelites (v. 45). ",
  "802":"These were the prophets sent by God (2 Chron. 24:19; 36:15). ",
  "803":"This was the persecution suffered by the Old Testament prophets (Jer. 37:15; Neh. 9:26; 2 Chron. 24:21). ",
  "804":"This is Christ. ",
  "805":"This statement indicates that the Jewish leaders, wanting to maintain their false position, envied Christ because of His rights. ",
  "806":"Christ was killed outside the city of Jerusalem (Heb. 13:12). ",
  "807":"This was fulfilled when the Roman prince Titus and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. ",
  "808":"These were the apostles. ",
  "809":"The stone is Christ, who is for God's building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who should have been working on God's building. ",
  "810":"Christ is not only the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16) and the topstone (Zech. 4:7) but also the cornerstone. ",
  "811":"The kingdom of God was already there among the Israelites, but the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near (3:2; 4:17). This proves that the kingdom of the heavens is different from the kingdom of God. (See note 3 in ch. 5.) ",
  "812":"This is the church. ",
  "813":"This is a person who stumbles on Christ; referring in particular to the unbelieving Israelites (Isa. 8:15; Rom. 9:32). ",
  "814":"These are the nations, the Gentiles, that Christ will smite and break into pieces at His coming back (Dan. 2:34-35). To the believers Christ is the foundation stone, the One in whom they trust (Isa. 28:16); to the unbelieving Jews He is the stone of stumbling (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33); and to the nations He will be the smiting stone. ",
  "815":"The parable of the vineyard in ch. 21 refers to the Old Testament, in which was the kingdom of God (21:43), whereas the parable of a wedding feast in this chapter refers to the New Testament, in which is the kingdom of the heavens. <br><br>   In the foregoing parable (21:33-46) the Lord illustrated how the Jews, who were in the kingdom of God, would be punished, and how the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to the kingdom people. Another parable was needed for Him to illustrate how the kingdom people, who are in the kingdom of the heavens, will be dealt with strictly. Both parables indicate that the kingdom is a serious matter. ",
  "816":"The king is God, and the son is Christ. ",
  "817":"In the foregoing parable the Old Testament was likened to a vineyard, with the focus mainly on the matter of labor under the law; in this parable the New Testament is likened to a wedding feast, with the focus mainly on the matter of enjoyment under grace. ",
  "818":"These are the first group of New Testament apostles. ",
  "819":"These are the apostles sent later by the Lord. ",
  "820":"Primarily the first meal, taken early in the morning, before work. ",
  "821":"Both the oxen and the fatted cattle refer to Christ, who was killed so that God's chosen people could enjoy Him as a feast. ",
  "822":"These were the Roman troops who, under the leadership of Titus, destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. ",
  "823":"The rejection by the Jews made them unworthy to enjoy the New Testament (Acts 13:46). ",
  "824":"Because of the rejection by the Jews, the preaching of the New Testament turned to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46; Rom. 11:11). ",
  "825":"This wedding garment is typified by the embroidered garment in Psa. 45:14 and is signified by the fine linen in Rev. 19:8 (see note 2 there). This is the surpassing righteousness of the overcoming believers, mentioned in 5:20 (see note 1 there). The man not clothed with a wedding garment is saved, because he has come to the wedding feast. He has received Christ as his righteousness that he might be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26), but he has not lived Christ out as his subjective righteousness (Phil. 3:9) that he might participate in the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens. He has been called to salvation, but he has not been chosen for the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens, which is for the overcoming believers only. ",
  "826":"The servants should refer to the angels (cf. 13:41, 49). ",
  "827":"To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally, to be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived by Christ an overcoming life. In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom (Col. 3:4), whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness (see note 12 in ch. 8). ",
  "828":"See note 12 in ch. 8. ",
  "829":"To be called is to receive salvation (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 4:1), whereas to be chosen is to receive a reward. All believers have been called, but few will be chosen to receive a reward. ",
  "830":"See note 7 in ch. 3. ",
  "831":"The Herodians were those who took sides with King Herod's regime and took part with him in infiltrating Grecian and Roman manners of life into Jewish culture. They sided with the Sadducees but were opposed to the Pharisees. But here they united with the Pharisees to ensnare the Lord Jesus. ",
  "832":"Lit., it does not matter to you concerning anyone. ",
  "833":"Lit., look into the face of men. ",
  "834":"This was truly an ensnaring question. Giving tribute to Caesar was opposed by all the Jews. If the Lord Jesus had said that it was lawful to do this, He would have offended all the Jews, whose leaders were the Pharisees. If He had said that it was not lawful, the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, would have had strong ground to accuse Him. ",
  "835":"See note 2 in ch. 6. ",
  "836":"The Lord Jesus did not show the Roman coin but asked them to show one to Him. Since they possessed one of the Roman coins, they were caught. ",
  "837":"See note 7 in John 6. ",
  "838":"This is to pay tribute to Caesar according to his governmental regulations. ",
  "839":"This is to pay the half-shekel to God according to Exo. 30:11-16, and to offer all the tithes to God according to the law of God. ",
  "840":"See note 7 in ch. 3. ",
  "841":"Knowing the Scriptures is one thing; knowing the power of God is another. We need to know both. The Scriptures here refer to the Old Testament verses that concern the matter of resurrection, and the power of God refers to the power of resurrection. ",
  "842":"As God is the God of the living and is called \"the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,\" so the dead Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be resurrected. This is the way the Lord Jesus expounded the Scriptures &#151; not only according to the letter but also according to the life and power implied within them. ",
  "843":"One who was knowledgeable in the law of Moses, a professional interpreter of the law of the Old Testament. ",
  "844":"Lit., in. ",
  "845":"Both commandments, the commandment to love God and the commandment to love man, are a matter of love. Love is the spirit of God's commandments. ",
  "846":"As portrayed in 21:23--22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions. First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority (21:23). Their question was according to their religious concept. Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics. Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief. Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, \"What do you think concerning the Christ?\" This question of questions must be answered by everyone. ",
  "847":"Christ can be known by us only in our spirit through God's revelation (Eph. 3:5). ",
  "848":"Christ is God; in His divinity He is the Lord of David. He is also a man; in His humanity He is the Son of David. The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ's person, i.e., that He was the Son of David according to His humanity. They did not have the other half, i.e., that He was the Son of God according to His divinity. ",
  "849":"Christ's question of questions concerning His wonderful person muzzled the mouths of all His opposers. ",
  "850":"See note 4 in ch. 2. ",
  "851":"See note 7 in ch. 3. ",
  "852":"Phylacteries are small leather boxes containing parts of the law written on parchment. According to Deut. 6:8 and 11:18, they were worn on the forehead as a frontlet and on the left arm. The scribes and the Pharisees broadened them and considered them a charm. ",
  "853":"The law required the Israelites to make fringes on the borders of their garments with a band of blue. The fringes signified that their conduct (typified by the garment) was regulated by the heavenly rule (indicated by the band of blue), and they were to be a reminder to them to keep God's commandments (Num. 15:38-39). The scribes and Pharisees enlarged the fringes, pretending that they were keeping God's commandments and were being regulated by them to a surpassing degree. ",
  "854":"A title of honor meaning teacher, master. ",
  "855":"Christ alone is our Teacher and Master. ",
  "856":"God alone is our Father. ",
  "857":"Lit., the Heavenly. ",
  "858":"Or, guides, teachers, directors. ",
  "859":"Christ alone is our Instructor, Guide, Teacher, and Director. ",
  "860":"See note 2 in ch. 6. So throughout this chapter. ",
  "861":"In today's Christianity some are just like this. ",
  "862":"This verse is not found in the earliest MSS. ",
  "863":"Or, condemnation. ",
  "864":"See note 22 in ch. 5. So in v. 33. ",
  "865":"Lit., he owes. So in v. 18. ",
  "866":"To make the gold holy positionally by changing its position from a common place to a holy place. See note 19 in Rom. 6. ",
  "867":"This too was a positional sanctification, not a dispositional one, and was accomplished by changing the gift's location from a common place to a holy place. See note 19 in Rom. 6. ",
  "868":"Or, judgment. ",
  "869":"Although the Lord stressed the weightier matters, He charged us not to neglect the lighter ones. ",
  "870":"The New Testament apostles sent out by the Lord. ",
  "871":"Referring to all the sins through which the blood of the righteous was shed on the earth. ",
  "872":"It was always God Himself who cared for Jerusalem, as a bird flutters over her young (Isa. 31:5; Deut. 32:11-12). Hence, when the Lord Jesus said, \"I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings,\" He indicated that He was God Himself. ",
  "873":"Since house here is singular, it must denote the house of God, which was the temple (21:12-13). It had been the house of God, but now it was called \"your house\" because the Jews had made it a den of robbers (21:13). ",
  "874":"This prophecy corresponds with that in 24:2, which was fulfilled when Titus and the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. ",
  "875":"This is the Lord's second coming, when all the remnant of Israel will turn and will believe in Him and be saved (Rom. 11:23, 26). ",
  "876":"The Lord came out from the temple, indicating that He had left the temple. This was to fulfill His word in 23:38, concerning His leaving the temple to the rejecting Jews as their house of desolation. This was equivalent to God's glory leaving the temple in the ancient time (Ezek. 10:18). ",
  "877":"The entire precincts of the temple. ",
  "878":"This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus and the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem. ",
  "879":"To receive the vision of the Lord's prophecy concerning this age, we need to climb the high mountain to enter into His presence. ",
  "880":"The disciples' question concerned three matters: (1) the time when \"these things\" would take place, including not only the destruction of the temple (v. 2) but also the things mentioned in 23:32-39; (2) the sign of Christ's coming; and (3) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord's word from 24:4--25:46 answered the disciples' question concerning these three matters. ",
  "881":"Gk. parousia, which means presence. Christ's coming will be His presence with His people. This presence (parousia) will begin with the rapture of the man-child (Rev. 12:5) and the rapture of the firstfruits (Rev. 14:1-4) and will end with His appearing on the earth with the saints. During the period of His parousia there will be the great tribulation (v. 21; Rev. 9:1-21; 11:14; 16:1-21), which will begin with supernatural calamities (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12); Christ's descending to the air (Rev. 14:14); the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17); the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10); and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). (See the chart \"The Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints\" at the end of the New Testament.) ",
  "882":"The Lord's answer has three sections: the first section (vv. 4-31) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second (v. 32--25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. For instance, the winter in v. 20 is the actual winter, but the summer in v. 32 is a symbol signifying the time of restoration. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, also should be interpreted literally. ",
  "883":"Some aspects of the prophecy in vv. 4-14 have been fulfilled, and some are in the process of being fulfilled. At the time of the great tribulation, which will be the consummation, the end, of this age, the prophecy will be fully fulfilled. ",
  "884":"Wars here denotes all the wars from the first century to the present. They are signified by the red horse of the second seal in Rev. 6:3-4. ",
  "885":"The end denotes the consummation of this age (v. 3; Dan. 12:4, 9, 6-7), which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation. Although vv. 6-9 and 14 are in the section concerning Israel, the tribulations and the preaching of the gospel mentioned in these verses take place generally, in the whole world, from the time of Christ's ascension to the end of this age. Verse 15, immediately following v. 14, speaks concerning the beginning of the great tribulation (v. 21), which is the time when Antichrist will set up his image in the temple of God, which image will thereby become the abomination of desolation. ",
  "886":"Nation denotes the people, the Gentiles; kingdom denotes an empire. ",
  "887":"Famines issue mainly from war. According to history, war has often brought famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in Rev. 6:5-6. ",
  "888":"Since Christ's ascension, earthquakes have been occurring throughout all the centuries and will be intensified at the end of this age (Rev. 6:12; 8:5; 11:13, 19; 16:18). ",
  "889":"Birth pangs are for the bringing forth of a child. In His New Testament economy, God's desire and purpose are to bring forth many sons (Gal. 3:26; Heb. 2:10) as His expression. Hence, birth pangs here refers to all the tribulations in the New Testament age, including wars, famines, earthquakes, afflictions, and persecutions, as mentioned in vv. 6-9 and 21. The birth pangs here are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord's sake, whereas the travailing in birth in Rev. 12:2 refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God's people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel (v. 14), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future. Galatians 4:19 and Rev. 12:2 and 5 confirm this viewpoint. ",
  "890":"Referring to the Jewish disciples, who were the prophets and wise men sent to the Jews (23:34). ",
  "891":"See note 22 in ch. 10. ",
  "892":"The gospel of the kingdom, which includes the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), brings people not only into God's salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 1:9). The gospel of grace emphasizes forgiveness of sin, God's redemption, and eternal life, whereas the gospel of the kingdom emphasizes the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord. This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age. Hence, that preaching, signified by the white horse of the first seal in Rev. 6:1-2, will be a sign of the consummation of this age. ",
  "893":"The gospel of the kingdom is a testimony to all the nations (Gentiles). This testimony must spread to the whole earth before the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. ",
  "894":"See note 6. ",
  "895":"No one knows the length of time spanning the events mentioned in vv. 4-14. But the prophecy in vv. 15-31, concerning the remnant of the Jews, definitely will be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Dan. 9:27, which will begin with the setting up of Antichrist's image (the idol) in the temple (v. 15) and will end with Christ's open coming (v. 30). ",
  "896":"Abomination denotes an idol (Deut. 29:17). Here it refers to Antichrist's image, which will be set up as an idol in the temple of God (Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4) at the beginning of the great tribulation (v. 21). Hence, this idol will be another sign of the consummation of this age.",
  "897":"Lit., causing desolation, desolating. The abomination, the image of Antichrist, will cause desolation. Antichrist is called \"the destroyer\" (Apollyon &#151; Rev. 9:11); he will do much destroying (Dan. 8:13, 23-25; 9:27). ",
  "898":"Holy place here refers to the sanctuaries in God's temple (Psa. 68:35; Ezek. 7:24; 21:2). ",
  "899":"For those who are pregnant or are nursing babies, it will be difficult to escape. ",
  "900":"Winter is a time when escape is difficult. ",
  "901":"On the Sabbath one was allowed to walk only a short distance (Acts 1:12), a distance not adequate for escaping. The mentioning of the Sabbath here indicates that the Jews would still keep the Sabbath after the restoration of the nation of Israel. The disciples, the audience for the Lord's word here, had a twofold status, one as representatives of the remnant of the Jews and the other as the New Testament believers, who constitute the church. In the section of the Lord's word that concerns the Jews (vv. 4-31), the disciples represent the remnant of the Jews, whereas in the section that concerns the church (24:32--25:30), they represent the New Testament believers. In the four Gospels, in matters regarding outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews, but in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them New Testament believers. ",
  "902":"The great tribulation will occur in the last three and a half years of this age. See note 2 in Rev. 11. The great tribulation spoken of here will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference, whereas the trial mentioned in Rev. 3:10 will have Rome as its center and the whole inhabited earth as its circumference. ",
  "903":"The great tribulation will last only three and a half years. See note 2 in Rev. 11. ",
  "904":"The chosen here refers to the Jews, God's chosen people (Rom. 11:28). So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "905":"The Jews rejected Jesus as their Messiah and are expecting a Messiah who is yet to come. They need to be warned that Messiah, the Christ, will not arise here or there on earth but will descend from heaven on the cloud. ",
  "906":"Antichrist will be the last of the false Christs and will work signs and lying wonders with the power of Satan in order to deceive the perishing (2 Thes. 2:3, 9-10). ",
  "907":"Another beast in Rev. 13:11 denotes the last of the false prophets (Rev. 19:20), who will do great signs to deceive those who dwell on earth (Rev. 13:13-14). ",
  "908":"Lit., give. ",
  "909":"The wilderness is where a person might go in order to separate himself from the world. His doing this might easily cause people to wonder whether he is the Messiah, as happened in the case of John the Baptist (3:1; John 1:19-20). ",
  "910":"Or, private rooms; a place where a person can make himself appear mystical so as to charm people. ",
  "911":"The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect, related to His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect, related to the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning here signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation (vv. 29-30), whereas the thief's coming in v. 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation. Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. Hence, the Lord's coming like a flash of lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord's parousia (see note 3). This implies also that the Lord is like electricity. ",
  "912":"See note 3. So in vv. 37 and 39. ",
  "913":"Taken in context, vv. 15 and 21 imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation. It is he who will need to be judged and destroyed. All people in Adam are dead (1 Cor. 15:22); thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon (Rev. 19:17-21), is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures' appetite. Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isa. 40:31), and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles (Deut. 28:49; Hosea 8:1). Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God's judgment upon them. This indicates not only that at His appearing, Christ with His overcoming saints will appear in the place where Antichrist is with his armies, but also that Christ with His overcomers will appear swiftly from the air like vultures. This corresponds with the flash of lightning in the foregoing verse. ",
  "914":"This is strong proof that the open coming of Christ will take place after the great tribulation (v. 21). ",
  "915":"This supernatural calamity will occur in heaven after the great tribulation, at the close of the end of this age (see note 12 in Rev. 6). This differs from the calamities of the sixth seal and the fourth trumpet (Rev. 6:12-13; 8:12), which will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation. ",
  "916":"We have no way of knowing what this sign is. However, it must be supernatural and clearly visible (perhaps like the lightning in v. 27), appearing in heaven. ",
  "917":"The tribes here are the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land is the Holy Land. At the Lord's appearing, all the tribes of Israel will repent and mourn (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). ",
  "918":"Lit., beat the breast. ",
  "919":"By this time the Lord will no longer be in the cloud but on the cloud, appearing to the people on earth. This is the open aspect of His second coming. See note 1 in Rev. 10 and note 14 in Rev. 14. ",
  "920":"In Christ's first coming He manifested His authority in acts such as His casting out of demons and His healing of diseases (Mark 6:7; Matt. 8:8-9), to vindicate Himself as the heavenly King; whereas in His second coming He will exercise His power to execute God's judgment, to destroy Antichrist and his armies, and to bind Satan, for the establishing of His kingdom on earth. ",
  "921":"After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together to the Holy Land the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth. This will be the fulfillment not only of the Lord's word in 23:37 but also of God's promise in the Old Testament (see reference 31a). ",
  "922":"But indicates that v. 32 begins another section. This section, 24:32--25:30, concerns the church. ",
  "923":"The fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel, was cursed in 21:19 (see notes there). It passed through a long winter, from the first century A.D. to 1948, when Israel was restored as a nation. At that time its branch became tender and put forth its leaves. To the believers this fig tree is a sign of the end of this age. ",
  "924":"The branch's becoming tender signifies that life has come back. ",
  "925":"The putting forth of leaves signifies engaging in outward activities. ",
  "926":"Winter signifies the time of being dried up (21:19), the time of tribulation (vv. 7-21); summer signifies the age of the (restored) kingdom (Luke 21:30-31), which will begin at the Lord's second coming. ",
  "927":"All these things refers to the things predicted in vv. 7-32. ",
  "928":"It refers to the restoration of the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6), signified by the summer in v. 32. ",
  "929":"Generation here does not refer to a generation defined according to an age or a person, like the generations mentioned in 1:17; it refers to a generation defined by the moral condition of the people, like the generations in 11:16; 12:39, 41-42, 45; and Prov. 30:11-14. ",
  "930":"The Son, standing in the position of the Son of Man (v. 37), does not know the day and hour of His coming back. ",
  "931":"The Lord's coming (parousia) will be like the days of Noah. This indicates that when the Lord's parousia is about to come, it will be like the days of Noah; that is, the situation before the Lord's coming will be like that in the days of Noah. ",
  "932":"For indicates that this verse is the explanation of why and how the Lord's parousia will be like the days of Noah. In the days of Noah the following conditions existed: (1) people were befuddled by eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, and (2) they did not know that judgment was coming, until the flood came and took them away. When the Lord's parousia is about to come, people will likewise be befuddled by the necessities of this life and will not know that God's judgment (signified by the flood) will come upon them by the Lord's appearing. The believers, however, should be de-drugged and should soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God's judgment upon this corrupted world. ",
  "933":"In the beginning, eating, drinking, and marriage were ordained by God for man's existence. But because of man's lust Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God's interest. At the end of this age, near the coming of the Lord's parousia, this kind of situation will be intensified. ",
  "934":"At that time indicates that while the worldly people are befuddled by the material things and have no sense of the coming judgment, some of the sober and watchful believers will be taken. To the befuddled and senseless people, this should be a sign of Christ's coming. ",
  "935":"These men must be brothers in Christ. ",
  "936":"Both in the field and grinding signify working for a living. Although the believers should not be befuddled by the necessities of this life, they need to work for a living. Any thought of giving up proper work by which one earns a living is another extreme of Satan's tactics. ",
  "937":"This is to be raptured before the great tribulation. This rapture is a sign of the Lord's coming (parousia) and a sign to the Jews. ",
  "938":"These women must be sisters in the Lord. ",
  "939":"See note 40. ",
  "940":"See note 40. ",
  "941":"Both watch therefore and your Lord prove that the two men and two women in vv. 40 and 41 are saved believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved. ",
  "942":"Householder refers to the believer, and house to the conduct and work that a believer has built up in his Christian life. ",
  "943":"A thief comes at an unknown time to steal precious things. The Lord will come secretly, as a thief, to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch (v. 42). ",
  "944":"This is the Lord's secret coming to the watchful overcomers. ",
  "945":"Faithfulness is shown toward the Lord, whereas prudence is exercised toward the believers. Watchfulness is for being raptured into the Lord's presence (v. 42); faithfulness is for reigning in the kingdom (v. 47). ",
  "946":"Household refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who constitute the church (1 Tim. 3:15). ",
  "947":"Give them food refers to ministering the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. ",
  "948":"Here to be blessed is to be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom. ",
  "949":"In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions. This will be a reward to him. ",
  "950":"The evil slave is a saved believer, as seen in the fact that (1) he was appointed by the Lord (v. 45), (2) he called the Lord \"my Master,\" and (3) he believed that the Lord was coming. ",
  "951":"This is to mistreat fellow believers. ",
  "952":"This is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things. ",
  "953":"Referring to being cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom, unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom, which the faithful slaves will enjoy (v. 45; 25:21, 23). This corresponds with cast out ...into the outer darkness in the conclusion of the parable of the talents (25:14-30), which completes this section, vv. 45-51. ",
  "954":"This is not to perish eternally but to be chastened dispensationally. See note 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "955":"See note 2 in ch. 6. ",
  "956":"See note 12 in ch. 8. ",
  "957":"See note 3 in ch. 5 and notes 3 and 24 in ch. 13. ",
  "958":"Ten is the major part of twelve (Gen. 42:3-4; 1 Kings 11:30-31; Matt. 20:24). Hence, the ten virgins represent the majority of the believers, who will have died before the Lord's coming. The two men or two women in 24:40-41 represent the remaining believers, who will live until the Lord's coming. ",
  "959":"Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins. As virgins they bear the Lord's testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "960":"Lamps signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God as the oil (Rom. 8:16). The believers shine forth the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit. Thus, they become the light of the world and shine as a lamp in the darkness of this age (5:14-16; Phil. 2:15-16), bearing the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God. ",
  "961":"Went forth signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ. ",
  "962":"The bridegroom signifies Christ as the pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15). ",
  "963":"Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man (signified by four) with God (signified by one) added to him bears responsibility. The fact that five of the virgins are foolish and five are prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent. It indicates that all believers bear the responsibility of being filled with the Holy Spirit. ",
  "964":"Being foolish does not make these five virgins false. In nature they are the same as the five prudent ones. ",
  "965":"Oil signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). ",
  "966":"Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man's personality is in his soul. Hence, vessels here signifies the souls of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps but also take oil in their vessels. That they have oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16), and that they take oil in their vessels signifies that they have the Spirit of God filling and saturating their souls. ",
  "967":"Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30). ",
  "968":"Sleep signifies death (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His return, a majority of the believers become sick and then die. ",
  "969":"Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age (night). That time will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. ",
  "970":"This cry signifies the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16). ",
  "971":"A word different from meet in v. 1. The word in v. 1 refers to meeting someone alone and in secret, whereas the word here refers to meeting someone openly according to plan and ceremony. ",
  "972":"Arose signifies resurrection from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thes. 4:16 and 1 Cor. 15:52. ",
  "973":"Lit., adorned. Trimmed their own lamps signifies the virgins' dealing with the testimony in their living. This indicates that after we are resurrected, our living for the Lord's testimony still needs to be dealt with if it has not been perfected before we die. ",
  "974":"This word implies that even after they are resurrected, the foolish believers will still need the filling of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "975":"Going out proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins were lighted; they contained some oil but did not have an adequate supply. The foolish virgins represent the believers who are regenerated with the Spirit of God and indwelt by the Spirit of God, but who have not been filled with Him sufficiently to have their whole being saturated with Him. ",
  "976":"No one can obtain the filling of the Holy Spirit for others. ",
  "977":"Here those who sell oil must be the two witnesses who appear during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil (Rev. 11:3-4 and notes; Zech. 4:11-14). ",
  "978":"Buy indicates that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay this price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected. ",
  "979":"This is the Lord's coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16), a part of His coming (parousia). ",
  "980":"They must be those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9 and note 1). ",
  "981":"We should be ready (24:44), always having oil in our vessel, always being filled with the Spirit of God in our whole being. Watching and being ready should be our daily exercise for the Lord's coming (parousia). ",
  "982":"This is the rapture of the resurrected believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:17) at the time that the Lord's coming (parousia) descends to the air. ",
  "983":"This is the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9), which will be spread in the air (1 Thes. 4:17) on the path of the Lord's coming (parousia). It will occur before the manifestation of the kingdom and will be a reward of mutual enjoyment with the Lord, a reward to be given to the believers who are ready, who are equipped with the filling of the Holy Spirit before they die. ",
  "984":"This is not the door of salvation but the door through which one enters into the enjoyment of the Lord's wedding feast. ",
  "985":"This is the resurrected believers' coming before the Lord at a later time; it occurs later because of their unreadiness. ",
  "986":"Not know here carries the sense of not recognize, not approve, as in Luke 13:25. The foolish virgins had their lamps lighted, went forth to meet the Lord, died, and were resurrected and raptured, but were late in paying the price for the filling of the Holy Spirit. Because of this the Lord would not recognize them, approve them, for participation in His wedding feast. They miss this dispensational reward but do not lose their eternal salvation. ",
  "987":"This word, the same as in 24:42, indicates that vv. 1-13 are a completion of 24:40-44, a section on the believers' being watchful that they may be raptured. Verses 40-44 in ch. 24 unveil the rapture of living believers who are ready. Verses 1-13 of this chapter are needed to reveal the rapture of those who have died and are resurrected. ",
  "988":"This parable of the talents, like the parable of the ten virgins, concerns the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "989":"The man here signifies Christ, who was about to go abroad, into the heavens. ",
  "990":"Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service (1 Cor. 7:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1; Rom. 1:1). The believers' status in relation to Christ is of two aspects: in life they are virgins living for Him; in service, in work, they are His purchased slaves serving Him. ",
  "991":"His possessions signifies the church (Eph. 1:18) with all the believers, who constitute God's household (24:45). ",
  "992":"A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth 6,000 denarii (see note 7 in John 6). In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God (vv. 3-4), whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6). For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord's testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish. The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service (work), and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ. ",
  "993":"Own ability signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God's creation and our learning. ",
  "994":"Traded with them (talents) signifies our using of the gift that the Lord has given us. ",
  "995":"Gained another five (talents) signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste. ",
  "996":"The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift. It is very easy for the least gifted to mistreat or ignore their gift. ",
  "997":"The earth signifies the world; thus, dug in the earth signifies becoming involved in the world. Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord. ",
  "998":"Hid his master's money signifies rendering the Lord's gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses. To make any excuse for not using the Lord's gift is to hide the gift. This is always the danger with the one-talented ones, those who consider their gift to be the smallest. ",
  "999":"A long time signifies the entire church age. ",
  "1000":"Came signifies the Lord's descending to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His coming (parousia). After burying the talent in the earth, the evil slave thought that all would be well. Little did he know that his master would come to settle accounts with him. ",
  "1001":"Settled accounts signifies the Lord's judging at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers' living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15). See note 35 in Heb. 10. ",
  "1002":"This is to come to the judgment seat of Christ. ",
  "1003":"The gaining of another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents. ",
  "1004":"A few things signifies the Lord's work in this age. ",
  "1005":"Over signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom. ",
  "1006":"Many things signifies the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. ",
  "1007":"The joy of your master signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This refers to inward satisfaction, not to outward position. To participate in the Lord's joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom. ",
  "1008":"This is the same appraisal the Lord gave to the five-talented one. ",
  "1009":"This is the same reward the Lord gave to the five-talented one. Although the gift given to the two-talented one was smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord's appraisal and reward were the same in both cases. This indicates that the Lord's appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent. The same appraisal and reward would have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful. ",
  "1010":"The one-talented one also, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, came to the judgment seat of Christ in the air. This proves that he was not only saved but also raptured to the air. No unsaved person can be raptured and come to the judgment seat of Christ. ",
  "1011":"The Greek word refers to outward, objective knowledge, not to inward, subjective realization. ",
  "1012":"Apparently, the Lord is hard in His strictness. He demands that we use His gift to the fullest extent for His work, which requires our absoluteness. ",
  "1013":"Apparently, the Lord's work always begins from zero. Reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not winnow, He seemingly demands that we work for Him with nothing. This should not be an excuse for the one-talented one to neglect the use of his gift; rather, this should force him to exercise his faith so that he can use his gift to the uttermost. ",
  "1014":"Lit., scatter. So in v. 26. ",
  "1015":"To be afraid is negative. We should, rather, be positive and aggressive in using the Lord's gift. ",
  "1016":"This is to be too passive. We should be active in the Lord's work. ",
  "1017":"Merely to keep the Lord's gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it. ",
  "1018":"The Lord admits that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work. ",
  "1019":"This signifies the use of the Lord's gift to save people and to minister His riches to them. ",
  "1020":"Interest signifies the profitable result we gain for the Lord's work by using His gift. ",
  "1021":"This signifies that in the coming kingdom the Lord's gift will be taken away from slothful believers. ",
  "1022":"This signifies that the faithful believers' gift will be increased. ",
  "1023":"To everyone who gains profit in the church age, more gifts will be given in the coming kingdom age; but concerning the one who has not gained a profit in the church age, even the gift that he has will be taken away from him in the coming kingdom age. ",
  "1024":"See note 13 in ch. 22. ",
  "1025":"See note 12 in ch. 8 and note 13 in ch. 22. ",
  "1026":"This word, the same as in 24:51, indicates that vv. 14-30 are a completion of 24:45-51. Both sections concern faithfulness for the Lord's work. Verses 45-51 in ch. 24 deal with the slave's unfaithfulness in fulfilling the Lord's commission. Verses 14-30 in this chapter are needed so that the slave's unfaithfulness in using the Lord's talent can be dealt with. ",
  "1027":"See note 12 in ch. 8. ",
  "1028":"But indicates that what is spoken in vv. 31-46 is another section, the section concerning the Gentiles. ",
  "1029":"Son of Man is the title of Christ in relation to His kingdom, the Messianic kingdom (13:41). His judgment here is a preparation for that kingdom. ",
  "1030":"This is the open aspect of the Lord's coming. (See notes 27 and 37 in ch. 24.) It will be the continuation of His coming mentioned in 24:30. ",
  "1031":"The Lord's glory comprises the glory of His divinity (John 17:22, 24), the glory of His humanity (Psa. 45:3), the glory of His resurrection (John 7:39; Acts 3:13-15), and the glory of His ascension (Heb. 2:9). ",
  "1032":"The throne of David (Luke 1:32-33), which will be in Jerusalem (19:28; Jer. 3:17). ",
  "1033":"All the nations refers to all the Gentiles who remain at Christ's coming back to the earth, after He has destroyed those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). These remaining Gentiles will all be gathered and judged at Christ's throne of glory. This will be Christ's judgment of the living before the millennium (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). It differs from His judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15) and will be executed on the earth after His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat in the air (vv. 19-30). ",
  "1034":"The Lord is the Shepherd not only of the believers (John 10:11; Heb. 13:20) and the Jews (Psa. 80:1; Jer. 31:10) but also of all the Gentiles (Psa. 100:1-3). ",
  "1035":"The place of honor (1 Kings 2:18; Psa. 45:9). ",
  "1036":"After the judgment at Christ's throne of glory, the \"sheep\" will be transferred into the millennium to be the people living under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). In this way the \"sheep\" will inherit the (coming) kingdom. In the millennium there will be three sections: (1) the earth, where the blessing of God's creation will be, as mentioned in Gen. 1:28-30; (2) the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, from which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and (3) the heavenly and spiritual section (1 Cor. 15:50-52), the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (5:20; 7:21). The kingdom that the \"sheep\" will inherit consists of the first section. ",
  "1037":"The blessing of the first section in the millennium, the blessing of God's creation, was prepared for the \"sheep\" from the foundation of the world, whereas the blessing in the third section, the blessing of the heavenly and spiritual kingdom, was ordained for the believers before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4). ",
  "1038":"All the sufferings in vv. 35-39 will befall the believers who are left to be tried (Rev. 3:10 and note 2) during the great tribulation (24:21). ",
  "1039":"This will happen in the great tribulation, when the believers suffer the persecution of Antichrist (Rev. 13:6-7; 20:4). ",
  "1040":"These should refer to the believers who overcome the persecution of Antichrist (Rev. 15:2 and note 2). They will be with Christ at this judgment. ",
  "1041":"Christ's brothers are His believers (12:49-50). <br><br>   Christ is one with the believers, who are His members, as indicated in Acts 9:4. ",
  "1042":"The fire in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14-15). The \"goats\" will perish in the lake of fire, after Antichrist and the false prophet (Rev. 19:20) and before the devil and the resurrected sinners (Rev. 20:10, 15). This is part of the fulfillment of Rev. 14:10. ",
  "1043":"The lake of fire was prepared for the devil and his angels, not for man. However, if any man follows the devil in opposing the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the devil and the fallen angels. ",
  "1044":"This also will occur during Antichrist's persecution. ",
  "1045":"This is to perish in the lake of fire (v. 41). ",
  "1046":"So that the believers left on earth will be cared for during Antichrist's persecution, an eternal gospel will be preached to the nations (Rev. 14:6-7 and notes), as illustrated by the parable of the net in 13:47-50. The Lord will then judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God's dispensation. Those who obey that gospel and treat the suffering believers well will be blessed and reckoned as righteous and will inherit the kingdom (v. 34); but those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity. ",
  "1047":"The gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) brings eternal life into the believers (John 3:15-16) that they may live by God's life, whereas the eternal gospel brings the \"sheep\" into eternal life that they may live in the sphere of God's life. ",
  "1048":"The Passover was a type of Christ (1 Cor. 5:7). Christ was made the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in type by the Passover in Exo. 12. For the fulfillment of the type, Christ as the Passover lamb had to be killed on the day of the Passover. <br><br>   In the type, during the four days preceding the day of the Passover, the Passover lamb had to be examined in relation to its perfection (Exo. 12:3-6). Before His crucifixion Christ came to Jerusalem for the last time, six days before the Passover (John 12:1), and likewise was examined by the Jewish leaders for a few days (21:23--22:46). No blemish was found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover lamb for us. See note 37 in Mark 12. ",
  "1049":"Eventually, under God's sovereignty they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast (27:15) for the fulfillment of the type. ",
  "1050":"A leper signifies a sinner (8:2 and note 1). Simon, a leper, must have been healed by the Lord. Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast (v. 7) in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence. A saved sinner would always do this. ",
  "1051":"The disciples considered Mary's love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been \"wasted\" upon the Lord Jesus. To those who love Him in such a way He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering. What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness. ",
  "1052":"We must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him. ",
  "1053":"Mary received the revelation of the Lord's death through the Lord's words in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and v. 2 of this chapter. Hence, she grasped the opportunity to pour upon the Lord the best that she had. To love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him. ",
  "1054":"In the foregoing verse the Lord spoke of His burial, implying His death and resurrection, accomplished for our redemption. Hence, in this verse He called the gospel \"this gospel,\" referring to the gospel of His death, burial, and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:1-4). ",
  "1055":"The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord. We must preach both &#151; the Lord's loving us and our loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration. ",
  "1056":"At that time indicates that while one of the disciples was expressing her love to the Lord, loving Him to the uttermost, another was about to betray Him. One was treasuring the Lord, and at the same time another was delivering Him up. ",
  "1057":"I.e., thirty shekels of silver, the worth of a slave (Exo. 21:32). ",
  "1058":"The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a feast of seven days (Lev. 23:6). It is also called the Passover (Luke 22:1; Mark 14:1). Actually, the Feast of the Passover was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exo. 12:6, 11, 15-20; Lev. 23:5). ",
  "1059":"The Lord let Judas's own word condemn him. ",
  "1060":"The Lord and the disciples first ate the passover (vv. 20-25; Luke 22:14-18). Then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup (vv. 26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26) to replace the Feast of the Passover because He was going to fulfill the type and be the real Passover to us (1 Cor. 5:7). Now we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread (v. 17; 1 Cor. 5:8). ",
  "1061":"The bread of the Lord's table is a symbol signifying the Lord's body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27), which also is signified by the bread of the table (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16). ",
  "1062":"The Lord's blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God's full blessing. Concerning the Lord's table (1 Cor. 10:21), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing. Hence, the cup is called \"the cup of blessing\" (1 Cor. 10:16). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). In Adam our portion was the cup of God's wrath (Rev. 14:10). Christ drank that cup for us (John 18:11), and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us (Psa. 116:13), the cup that runs over (Psa. 23:5). By partaking of this cup we have the fellowship of the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16). ",
  "1063":"The product of the vine (v. 29) within the cup of the Lord's table also is a symbol, signifying the Lord's blood shed on the cross for our sins. His blood was required by God's righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins (Heb. 9:22). ",
  "1064":"Some MSS insert, new. The Lord's blood, having satisfied God's righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20), a portion for us. The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price that Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed that God made for us, and the cup is the portion that we receive from God. ",
  "1065":"Referring to the juice of the grape. ",
  "1066":"This is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, in which the Lord will drink with us after His coming back. ",
  "1067":"This was a praise to the Father sung by the Lord with the disciples after the Lord's table. ",
  "1068":"Gethsemane means oil press. At Gethsemane the Lord was pressed so that the oil, the Holy Spirit, could flow out. ",
  "1069":"Referring to His death on the cross. ",
  "1070":"In spiritual things we are often like this. ",
  "1071":"A word of greeting, here and in 27:29. Both greetings were false (cf. 28:9). ",
  "1072":"This word is equivalent to: \"What are you doing here? You are betraying Me!\" This word was spoken to expose Judas's evil intention to betray the Lord. ",
  "1073":"This was Peter (John 18:10, 26). ",
  "1074":"In Greek these three words are military terms. ",
  "1075":"This way refers to His death on the cross, which was prophesied in the Scriptures. These prophecies had to be fulfilled. ",
  "1076":"This was a twisting of the Lord's word in John 2:19, \"[You] destroy this temple.\" ",
  "1077":"The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself, fulfilling Isa. 53:7. ",
  "1078":"See note 62. ",
  "1079":"This is the same question that the devil asked in tempting the Lord before He began His ministry (4:3, 6). ",
  "1080":"The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with \"the Son of Man.\" In His temptation He had answered the devil in the same way (4:4 and note 2). The Lord was the Son of Man on the earth before His crucifixion, has been the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God since His resurrection (Acts 7:56), and will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds. To accomplish God's purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord had to be a man. Without man, God's purpose could not be carried out on earth, nor could the kingdom of the heavens be constituted on earth. ",
  "1081":"I.e., speak forth miraculously as a prophet. This mocking word implies, \"Since You are a prophet of God, prophesy miraculously to identify the one who hit You.\"",
  "1082":"Peter could not withstand even a fragile little female! ",
  "1083":"Under God's sovereignty the environment would not let Peter go until he had been tested to the uttermost, that he might realize that he was absolutely untrustworthy and should no longer have any confidence in himself. ",
  "1084":"In his first denial Peter spoke words only (v. 70); in his second denial he replied with an oath (v. 72); in his third denial he cursed and swore. ",
  "1085":"Pilate, an agent of Caesar Tiberius, was a Roman procurator in Judea (Palestine) from A.D. 26-35. Not long after he unjustly delivered up the Lord Jesus to be crucified, his rule ended abruptly. He was banished and committed suicide. <br><br>   In the evil conspiracy the Jewish religionists convinced the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus. ",
  "1086":"Or, repented. ",
  "1087":"They would not take blood money. Actually, what they did to the Lord Jesus was more evil than Judas's deed (v. 1). ",
  "1088":"A chest or place in the temple where the gifts offered to God were kept. ",
  "1089":"The word quoted in vv. 9-10 was spoken by Jeremiah but recorded in Zechariah (Zech. 11:12-13). There was an idea among the Jews that Zechariah had the spirit of Jeremiah. ",
  "1090":"The Lord would not vindicate Himself. ",
  "1091":"See note 12. ",
  "1092":"It was unjust of Pilate to ask this question, for he knew that the Lord was innocent (v. 18) and that Barabbas was guilty. ",
  "1093":"This was sovereign of God. ",
  "1094":"This was to appease his conscience. ",
  "1095":"A timid and irresponsible withdrawal. ",
  "1096":"Some MSS add, righteous. ",
  "1097":"This utterly exposed the darkness and injustice of politics! This injustice fulfilled Isa. 53:5, 8. ",
  "1098":"The Jewish death penalty was carried out by stoning (Lev. 20:2, 27; 24:14; Deut. 13:10; 17:5). Crucifixion was a heathen practice (Ezra 6:11) adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only. The Lord Jesus' being crucified was a fulfillment not only of the Old Testament prophecies (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13; Num. 21:8-9) but also of the Lord's word concerning how He would die (John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32). These could not have been fulfilled by stoning. See note 32 in John 18. ",
  "1099":"I.e., the governor's official residence. ",
  "1100":"Thorns are a symbol of the curse (Gen. 3:17-18). On the cross the Lord Jesus became a curse for us (Gal. 3:13). ",
  "1101":"A mocking salutation or congratulation. The same Greek word as in 26:49. ",
  "1102":"The Lord, as the Passover lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isa. 53:7-8. ",
  "1103":"Cyrene was a Greek colonial city, the capital of Cyrenaica in North Africa. It seems that Simon was a Cyrenian Jew. ",
  "1104":"Golgotha is a Hebrew word (John 19:17) that means skull (Mark 15:22). Its equivalent in Latin is Calvaria, anglicized as Calvary (Luke 23:33, KJV). It does not mean a place of dead men's skulls, but simply skull. ",
  "1105":"Wine mingled with gall (and also with myrrh &#151; Mark 15:23) was used as a stupefying drink. ",
  "1106":"The Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. ",
  "1107":"The Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psa. 22:18. This too exposed the darkness of Roman politics. ",
  "1108":"This was for the fulfillment of Isa. 53:9a. ",
  "1109":"This was a repetition of the devil's temptation in the wilderness (4:6). ",
  "1110":"If He had saved Himself, He could not save us. ",
  "1111":"The sixth hour was 12:00 noon, and the ninth was 3:00 p.m. The Lord was crucified from the third hour, 9:00 a.m. (Mark 15:25), until the ninth hour, 3:00 p.m. He suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). Darkness fell over all the land (v. 45) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there; and because of our sin God forsook Him (v. 46). ",
  "1112":"See note 45. ",
  "1113":"God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners (1 Pet. 3:18) &#151; He bore our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6) and was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21). ",
  "1114":"Offered to the Lord in a mocking way (Luke 23:36) for quenching His thirst (John 19:28-30 and note 30). ",
  "1115":"This was His giving up of His spirit (John 19:30); it indicates that the Lord voluntarily yielded up His life (Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46). ",
  "1116":"This signifies that the separation between God and man had been abolished because the flesh of sin (the flesh being signified by the veil) taken by Christ (Rom. 8:3) had been crucified (Heb. 10:20 and note 2). ",
  "1117":"From top to bottom indicates that the rending of the veil was God's doing from above. ",
  "1118":"This signifies that the base of Satan's rebellion was shaken. ",
  "1119":"This signifies that the strongholds of Satan's earthly kingdom were broken. ",
  "1120":"This signifies that the power of death and Hades was conquered and subdued. ",
  "1121":"This signifies the releasing power of the death of Christ. ",
  "1122":"In the type, the firstfruits of the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11) were not a single stalk of wheat but a sheaf of wheat, typifying not only the resurrected Christ but also the saints who were raised from the dead after His resurrection, as seen here. <br><br>   All the things listed in vv. 51-53 are different aspects of the excellent effect of the Lord's death. ",
  "1123":"Where they went after this we have no way to trace. ",
  "1124":"The mother of the Lord Jesus (13:55). ",

  "1129":"The same Greek word is used in Luke 23:54. ",
  "1130":"Christ resurrected on the first day of the week. This signifies that His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for the kingdom of the heavens. See note 1 in John 20. ",
  "1131":"This signifies that the earth, the base of Satan's rebellion, was shaken by the Lord's resurrection. ",
  "1132":"This is good news, glad tidings! ",
  "1133":"The heavenly King began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles (4:12-17), not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion; after His resurrection He again went to Galilee, not to Jerusalem. This strongly indicates that the resurrected heavenly King had fully abandoned Judaism and had initiated a new age for God's New Testament economy. ",

  "1142":"The constitution of the kingdom was decreed on a mountain (see note 1 in ch. 5), the heavenly King's transfiguration took place on a high mountain (see note 1 in ch. 17), and the prophecy concerning this age was given on a mountain (see note 3 in ch. 24). Now, for God's economy of the New Testament the disciples needed to go to the mountain again. Only on the high level of a mountain can we see clearly the New Testament economy. ",
  "1143":"Or, hesitated, wavered. ",
  "1144":"In His divinity, as the only begotten Son of God, the Lord had authority over all. However, in His humanity, as the Son of Man and the King of the heavenly kingdom, authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection. ",
  "1145":"Because all authority was given to Him (v. 18), the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations. They go with His authority. ",
  "1146":"This is to make the heathen the kingdom people for the establishing of His kingdom, which is the church, even today, on this earth. ",
  "1147":"Baptism brings the repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist's recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible baptism by the Spirit, the visible baptism by water is vain, and without the visible baptism by water, the invisible baptism by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), the Jewish part on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:5; 2:4) and the Gentile part in the house of Cornelius (Acts 11:15-17). Then, based on this, the disciples baptized the new converts (Acts 2:38) not only into water but also into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4), into Christ Himself (Gal. 3:27), into the Triune God (v. 19), and into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb in which the baptized ones' old history is ended. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, and since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) and the Triune God eventually is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side, to terminate their old life, and on the positive side, to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens. ",
  "1148":"Into indicates union, as in Rom. 6:3 and Gal. 3:27. The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:5; and 1 Cor. 1:13, 15. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him. ",
  "1149":"There is one name for the Divine Trinity. The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is. ",
  "1150":"Matthew and John are the two books in which the Divine Trinity is revealed more fully than in all the other books of the Scripture, that God's chosen people may participate in and enjoy Him. For our experience of life, John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, especially in chs. 14--16; whereas for the constituting of the kingdom, Matthew discloses the reality of the Divine Trinity by giving one name for all three. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit (1:18), Christ (the Son &#151; 1:18), and God (the Father &#151; 1:23) are present for the producing of the man Jesus (1:21), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God. In ch. 3 Matthew presents a scene in which the Son was standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit like a dove descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke out of the heavens to the Son (3:16-17). In ch. 12 the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father (12:28). In ch. 16 the Father revealed the Son to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom (16:16-19). In ch. 17 the Son entered into transfiguration (17:2) and was confirmed by the Father's word of delight (17:5), bringing about a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom (16:28). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ as the last Adam had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Later, in the Acts and the Epistles it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ (Acts 8:16; 19:5), and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the person (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, having become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), is available at any time and in any place for people to be baptized into. According to Matthew, being baptized into the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for the constituting of the kingdom of the heavens. Unlike an earthly society, the heavenly kingdom cannot be formed with human beings of flesh and blood (1 Cor. 15:50); it can be constituted only with people who have been immersed into the union with the Triune God and who have been established and built up with the Triune God, who has been wrought into them. ",
  "1151":"Like baptizing people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, which is mentioned in the foregoing verse, teaching the believers to observe all that the Lord has commanded is for the discipling of all the nations (v. 19). ",
  "1152":"The heavenly King is Emmanuel, God with us (1:23). Here He promised that in His resurrection He will be with us all the days, with all authority, until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age. Hence, wherever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst (18:20). <br><br>   Among the four Gospels the Lord's ascension is recorded only in Mark (Mark 16:19) and Luke (Luke 24:51). John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers. As such, He can never and would never leave them. Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continuously until He comes back. Hence, in John and Matthew the Lord's ascension is not mentioned. ",
  "1153":"The end of this age, which is the time of His coming (parousia). ",
  "1154":"The writer of this Gospel was Mark, also called John (Acts 12:25), the son of one of the Marys (who was close to the apostle Peter in the church at Jerusalem &#151; Acts 12:12) and the cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10). He accompanied Barnabas and Saul in their ministry (Acts 12:25) and joined Paul in the first journey of his ministry to the Gentiles; but he left Paul and turned back at Perga (Acts 13:13). Because of his turning back, Paul refused to take him on his second journey. At that time Barnabas separated himself from Paul, and Mark then joined Barnabas in his work (Acts 15:36-40). However, Mark was close to Paul in Paul's later years (Col. 4:10; Philem. 24) and was useful to him for his ministry until Paul's martyrdom (2 Tim. 4:11). He was close to Peter and was probably with him continually, as seen in the fact that Peter considered him his son (1 Pet. 5:13). From the early days of the church his Gospel has been considered a written account of the oral presentation of Peter, who accompanied the Savior in His gospel service from its beginning (vv. 16-18) to its end (14:54, 66-72). Mark's record is according to historical sequence and gives more details concerning the historical facts than the other Gospels. The entire Gospel is summarized in Peter's word in Acts 10:36-42. <br><br>   John presents the God-Savior, emphasizing the Savior's deity in His humanity. Matthew presents the King-Savior; Mark, the Slave-Savior; and Luke, the Man-Savior. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are synoptic in portraying the Savior's humanity in different aspects, with His deity. Since Mark presents the Savior as a slave, he does not tell His genealogy and status, because the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note. Furthermore, in contrast to Matthew, who presents to us the Savior's marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John, who presents His profound revelations of divine truths, Mark's intention is not to impress us with the Slave's wonderful words but with His excellent deeds in His gospel service. Mark's Gospel provides more detail than the other Gospels in order to portray the Slave-Savior's diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. In Mark's Gospel are the fulfillment of the prophecies in Isa. 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13--53:12 concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah, and the details of the teaching in Phil. 2:5-11 regarding Christ as the Slave of God. His diligence in labor, His need of food and rest (3:20-21; 6:31), His anger (3:5), His groaning (7:34), and His affection (10:21) display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection, while His lordship (2:28), His omniscience (2:8), His miraculous power, and His authority to cast out demons (v. 27; 3:15), to forgive sins (2:7, 10), and to silence the wind and the sea (4:39) manifest in full His deity in its glory and honor. What a Slave of God! How lovely and admirable! Such a Slave served sinners as their Slave-Savior, with His life as their ransom (10:45), for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God, whose Slave He was. ",
  "1155":"I.e., glad tidings, good news (Rom. 10:15). The gospel is the service (ministry) of the Slave-Savior as a Slave of God serving His people. Matthew begins with the kingly generations of Christ the King (Matt. 1:1-17); Luke, with a human genealogy of Jesus the man (Luke 3:23-38); and John, with the eternal origin of the Son of God (John 1:1-2); whereas Mark begins not with the origin of His person but with the beginning of the gospel, the service of Jesus as a lowly Slave of God (Phil. 2:7; Matt. 20:27-28). As a rule, the service, not the person, of a slave is notable. See note 1 in Matt. 1. ",
  "1156":"This Gospel is a biography of the Slave-Savior, who was God incarnated as a Slave to save sinners. In this compound title, Jesus Christ denotes His humanity and the Son of God, His deity, both of which were adequately expressed by His human virtues and divine attributes in His ministry and move for His gospel service, as recorded in this Gospel. ",
  "1157":"Some MSS omit, the Son of God. ",
  "1158":"The beginning of the gospel of the Slave-Savior was even as it is written in Isaiah concerning the ministry of John the Baptist. This indicates that John's preaching of the baptism of repentance was also a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It terminated the dispensation of law and replaced it with the dispensation of grace. Hence, the dispensation of grace began with the ministry of John, before the ministry of the Slave-Savior. ",
  "1159":"Jehovah of hosts (Mal. 3:1). ",
  "1160":"The same Greek word as for angel. So in Rev. 1:20. ",
  "1161":"Jesus Christ's. ",
  "1162":"Lit., furnish. The preaching of the baptism of repentance (v. 4) paved the way for the Slave-Savior to come to sinners (Luke 1:76). ",
  "1163":"The ministry of the gospel of the Slave-Savior began with only a voice, not with a great movement. ",
  "1164":"The preaching of the gospel of the Slave-Savior began not in any center of civilization but in the wilderness, beyond the influence of human culture. See notes 3 and 1 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1165":"Lit., make ready. To prepare the way of the Lord is to change people's mind, turning their mind toward the Slave-Savior, and to make their heart right, straightening every part of their heart through repentance, that the Slave-Savior may enter into them to be their life and take possession of them (Luke 1:17). ",
  "1166":"I.e., appeared. ",
  "1167":"John was born a priest (Luke 1:8-13, 57-63); hence, he should have lived a priestly life in the temple, doing the priestly service. But he came to the wilderness and preached the gospel. This indicates that the age of the priesthood, in which sacrifices were offered to God, had been replaced by the age of the gospel, in which sinners are brought to God that God may gain sinners and that sinners may gain God. ",
  "1168":"Repentance is to change one's mind, turning it to the Slave-Savior, and baptism is to bury the repenting people, terminating them that the Slave-Savior may germinate them by regeneration (John 3:3, 5-6). ",
  "1169":"Or, unto. Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins, that the obstacle of man's fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God. ",
  "1170":"A region with the holy city, the holy temple, and high culture; hence, a region of honor. ",
  "1171":"When people repented through his preaching, John immersed them into the death water to bury them, to terminate them, thus preparing them to be raised up by the Slave-Savior, who germinated them with the Holy Spirit through the confession of their sins. See note 6 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1172":"See note 6 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1173":"The way John lived signifies that his living and work were altogether in a new dispensation and were not according to the way of the old religion, culture, and tradition. See note 4 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1174":"Although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He did not make himself the center of his ministry, as a magnet attracting others to himself. He realized that he was only a messenger sent by Jehovah of hosts to bring people to His Son, Jesus Christ, and to exalt Him as the goal of his ministry. ",
  "1175":"Water signifies death and burial for the termination of the repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated people. The former was a sign of John's ministry of repentance; the latter, a sign of the Slave-Savior's ministry of life. John buried the repenting people in the death water; the Slave-Savior raised them up that they might be regenerated in the Spirit of His resurrection life. The death water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ, into which His believers are baptized (Rom. 6:3), buried not only the baptized people but also their sins, the world, and their past life and history (just as the Red Sea buried Pharaoh and the Egyptian army for the children of Israel &#151; Exo. 14:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:2) and separated them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption (just as the flood did for Noah and his family &#151; 1 Pet. 3:20-21). The Holy Spirit, into whom the Slave-Savior baptized those who believed in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), which is joined to Christ in the one Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5, and note 5) into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule, that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom. ",
  "1176":"Galilee was called \"Galilee of the Gentiles\" and was a region without honor, hence, a despised region (John 7:52; see note 15 in Matt. 4), and Nazareth was a despised city of that despised region (John 1:46). The lowly Slave of God grew up and came out from that source. ",
  "1177":"As a Slave of God, the Slave-Savior too was baptized, signifying that He was willing to serve God and that He would serve not in man's natural way but through death and resurrection (see notes 13 and 16 in Matt. 3). Such a baptism was the initiation of His service. ",
  "1178":"Lit., into.",
  "1179":"Mark's record of a Slave reflects not the splendor of the status of this Slave's person but the diligence of His service. The word immediately is used in his record forty-two times, and one more time in alternate MSS. ",
  "1180":"The heavens being opened to the Slave-Savior signifies that His willing offering of Himself as a Slave to God was well accepted by God, and the Spirit's descending as a dove upon Him signifies that God anointed Him with the Spirit for His service to Him (Luke 4:18-19). ",
  "1181":"See note 16 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1182":"Some MSS add, and remaining. ",
  "1183":"See note 17 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1184":"After God's acceptance and anointing, the first thing the Spirit did with this Slave of God was to thrust Him into a test to prove His integrity. ",
  "1185":"A time of testing and suffering (Deut. 9:9, 18; 1 Kings 19:8). ",
  "1186":"Satan, the enemy of God, was used for the testing and proving of God's Slave. The animals of the earth, in a negative sense, and the angels from heaven, in a positive sense, also were used for this test. ",
  "1187":"John's imprisonment was a sign of the rejection of the gospel, especially in the region of honor. Hence, the Slave-Savior left that region and returned to the despised region for His service of the gospel. See notes 12 and 15 in Matt. 4. <br><br>   The gospel service was initiated in Judea, the region of honor, by the ministry of the Slave-Savior's forerunner (vv. 1-11); but it was continued in Galilee, the despised region, by the ministry of the Slave-Savior for a period of about three years (v. 14--9:50). In contrast to John's record in his Gospel (John 1:29-42; 2:13--3:36; 5:1-47; 7:10--11:57), Mark recorded nothing of the Slave-Savior's ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during that period of time. Mark recorded only the Lord's leaving of Galilee to go to Jerusalem for the last time (10:1) to accomplish His redemptive work. Then the gospel service was continued by His ministry on the way to Jerusalem and in Jerusalem and its vicinity (10:1--14:42). It was concluded with His redeeming death, His life-imparting resurrection, His ascension for exaltation, and the continuation of His gospel service, carried out by His disciples' preaching to all the creation (14:43--16:20). ",
  "1188":"The Slave-Savior's proclaiming was to announce God's glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage; His teaching (vv. 21-22) was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth. His proclaiming implied teaching, and His teaching implied proclaiming (Matt. 4:23). This was the first thing He did in His ministry, and it was the all-embracing structure of His evangelistic service (vv. 38-39; 3:14; 6:12; 14:9; 16:15, 20). ",
  "1189":"Some MSS add, of the kingdom. The gospel of Jesus Christ (v. 1) is the gospel of God (Rom. 1:1) and the gospel of the kingdom of God (cf. Matt. 4:23). ",
  "1190":"The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. It is the goal of the gospel of God and of Jesus Christ (see notes 3 and 26 in ch. 4). To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom (John 3:3, 5). All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 14:17). This kingdom will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) that they may reign with Christ a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). Then, as the eternal kingdom it will be an eternal blessing of God's eternal life for all God's redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14, 17). It was such a kingdom of God that had drawn near and into which the gospel of the Slave-Savior would bring His believers. For this kingdom the Slave-Savior told people to repent and believe in the gospel. See notes 3 in John 3, 28 in Heb. 12, and 3 in Matt. 5. ",
  "1191":"The Greek word means have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. On the negative side, to repent before God is not only to repent of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption, which usurp and corrupt people whom God created for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, it is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man. It is a \"repentance unto God,\" and is to \"repent and turn to God\" (Acts 20:21; 26:20). See notes 2 and 2 in Matt. 3. ",
  "1192":"Repentance is mainly in the mind; believing is mainly in the heart (Rom. 10:9). To believe in is to believe into the things in which we believe and to receive into us the things in which we believe. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in the Slave-Savior (Acts 16:31), and to believe in Him is to believe into Him (John 3:15-16) and to receive Him into us (John 1:12) that we may be organically united with Him. Such a faith in Christ (Gal. 3:22) is given to us by God through our hearing of the word of the truth of the gospel (Rom. 10:17; Eph. 1:13). This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel (Gal. 3:14). Hence, it is precious to us (2 Pet. 1:1). Such a precious faith must be preceded by repentance. See note 16 in ch. 16. ",
  "1193":"This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (v. 1), the gospel of God, and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with all the processes He passed through (such as incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension) and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the content of the gospel (Rom. 1:2-4; Luke 2:10-11; 1 Cor. 15:1-4; 2 Tim. 2:8). Hence, the gospel is of Him. The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God (Eph. 1:8-9; Acts 2:23; Rom. 1:2; 2 Cor. 5:21; Acts 3:15), and it is the power of God unto salvation to all the believers (Rom. 1:16) that they may be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:19) and regenerated by Him (1 Pet. 1:3) to be His children (John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16) and to enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance (Eph. 1:14). Hence, it is the gospel of God. It brings the believers into the realm of the divine ruling that they may participate in the blessings of the divine life in the divine kingdom (1 Thes. 2:12). Hence, it is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Thus, its full contents are the same as those of the New Testament with all its bequests. When we believe in this gospel, we inherit the Triune God with His redemption, His salvation, and His divine life with its riches as our eternal portion. ",

The Slave-Savior, as the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5), came as a great light to Galilee, the land of darkness, to shine on the people who were sitting in the shadow of death (Matt. 4:12-16). His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death that they might receive the light of life (John 1:4). The second thing that the Slave of God did in His service as the Slave-Savior to fallen men was to carry out such teaching (2:13; 4:1; 6:2, 6, 30, 34; 10:1; 11:17; 12:35; 14:49) to bring people out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18). ",
  "1202":"The self-appointed scribes, who by themselves were teaching vain knowledge, had no authority and no power, but this God-authorized Slave, who by God was teaching realities, had not only spiritual power to subdue people but also divine authority to subject people to the divine ruling. ",
  "1203":"Not a fallen angel but a demon (vv. 32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33), a disembodied spirit of one of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan's rebellion (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12), and these unclean spirits, the demons, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The demons' possession of people signifies Satan's usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The third thing the Slave-Savior, who came to destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8), did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people (vv. 34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) that they might be delivered from Satan's bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan's authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13), into God's kingdom (v. 15). Five cases are recorded in this Gospel to illustrate this (vv. 23-27; 5:2-20; 7:25-30; 9:17-27; 16:9). ",
  "1204":"Lit., What to us and to you? (a Hebrew idiom). ",
  "1205":"It was not power but authority that cast out the demon. For His service the Slave-Savior had divine authority not only to teach people (v. 22) but also to cast out demons. ",
  "1206":"This may signify a person's unbridled temper, which is abnormal and intemperate. ",
  "1207":"Sickness issues from sin and is a sign of man's abnormal condition before God because of sin. The fourth thing the Slave-Savior did to rescue the sinners, as another part of His gospel service, was to heal their sick condition physically and spiritually and restore them to normality (v. 34; 3:10; 6:5, 13, 56) that they might serve Him. Nine cases are recorded in this Gospel to illustrate such healing (vv. 30-31, 40-45; 2:3-12; 3:1-5; 5:22-43; 7:32-37; 8:22-26; 10:46-52). ",
  "1208":"First she was healed, then she served. ",
  "1209":"See note 31. ",
  "1210":"See note 23. So in v. 39. ",
  "1211":"Some MSS read, they knew Him to be Christ. ",
  "1212":"To fellowship with God, seeking God's will and pleasure for His gospel service. The Slave-Savior performed the evangelistic service not by Himself, independent of God and according to His own will, but according to God's will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose (see note 38). ",
  "1213":"See note 14. ",
  "1214":"As the Slave of God, the Slave-Savior served God in His gospel to carry out not His own will or the people's proposal but the will of God, who had sent Him (John 6:38; 4:34). ",
  "1215":"A leper portrays a typical sinner. Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, much more serious than a fever (v. 30), causing its victim to be isolated from God and from men (see notes 2 and 3 in Matt. 8). The cleansing of the leper signifies the recovering of the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men. This was the consummating part of the Slave-Savior's gospel service according to the record of this chapter. <br><br>   The Slave-Savior's gospel service to God comprised (1) preaching (vv. 14-15, 38-39) to announce the glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage; (2) teaching (vv. 21-22) to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth; (3) casting out demons (vv. 25-26) to annihilate Satan's usurpation of man; (4) healing man's sick condition (vv. 30-31) that man might serve the Slave-Savior; and (5) cleansing the leper (vv. 41-42) to recover the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men. What a wonderful and excellent work! ",
  "1216":"The Slave-Savior's compassion and willingness, issuing from His love, were dear and precious to the hopeless leper. ",
  "1217":"Showing His sympathy and intimacy toward the miserable leper, whom no one dared to touch. ",
  "1218":"Not only healed (see note 31) but cleansed. Like other diseases, leprosy requires healing; like sin (1 John 1:7), it also requires cleansing because of its filthy and contaminating nature. ",
  "1219":"Such a charge, given throughout the record of the Slave-Savior's evangelistic service, is quite striking (5:43; 7:36; 9:9). It is similar to what was prophesied in Isa. 42:2 concerning His quiet character. He wanted His work to be done within the limits of a move that was absolutely according to God's purpose and that was not promoted by man's excitement and propaganda. See note 26 in ch. 8. ",
  "1220":"Lit., word. ",
  "1221":"Man's activity, which is according to the natural concept, frustrates the Slave-Savior's service, which is according to God's purpose. ",
  "1222":"The five incidents vividly recorded in 2:1--3:6 form one particular group, showing how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the needs of fallen people, who had been captured by Satan and carried away from God and the enjoyment of God, that they might be rescued from their captivity and might be brought back to God as their enjoyment. <br><br>   (1) As God with divine authority, He forgave the sins of the victim of sickness that He might release him from Satan's oppression (Acts 10:38) and restore him to God. The scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion (vv. 1-12). <br><br>   (2) As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God. This was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees (vv. 13-17). <br><br>   (3) As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting. Thus He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists) so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God's Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God's New Testament economy (vv. 18-22). <br><br>   (4) He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath so that they could satisfy their hunger. Thus, apparently they broke God's commandment concerning the Sabbath, but actually they pleased God because the hunger of Christ's followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers had been satisfied with the bread of the presence in the house of God. This indicates that in God's New Testament economy, it is a matter not of keeping the regulation of religion but of enjoying satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest (vv. 23-28). <br><br>   (5) On the Sabbath He healed a man who had a withered hand, caring not for the keeping of the Sabbath but for the health of His sheep. Thus He indicated that in God's New Testament economy it is a matter not of keeping regulations but of imparting life. For this He was hated by the Pharisees, the religionists (3:1-6). <br><br>   All five merciful and living ways taken by the Slave-Savior to carry out His gospel service contradicted the formal and traditional religion and were therefore abhorred by the fleshly, stubborn, and lifeless religious leaders. ",
  "1223":"Or, in the house. ",
  "1224":"Signifying a sinner paralyzed by sin, one who is unable to walk and move before God. ",
  "1225":"Their zeal in seeking the Slave-Savior's healing compelled the seekers to break through the proper barrier &#151; a wild act. See note 2 in Matt. 9. ",
  "1226":"A small mattress or pad. So in vv. 9, 11, and 12. ",
  "1227":"Faith here, which issues from hearing the word of Christ (Rom. 10:17), indicates that the seekers had heard of the Slave-Savior. ",
  "1228":"This loving word spoken by the Slave-Savior implies kindness; in this His human virtue was expressed. ",
  "1229":"Sins are the cause of sickness. The Slave-Savior's word here touched the cause of sickness so that a healing effect could come. Once the sins had been forgiven, the sickness was healed. ",
  "1230":"The scribes and Pharisees, as the religionists of the old and dead religion, were motivated and used by Satan, the enemy of God, to oppose, resist, and frustrate the gospel service of the Slave of God throughout His ministry (vv. 16, 24; 3:22; 7:5; 8:11; 9:14; 10:2; 11:27; 12:13, 28). They thought that they were worshipping God and were zealous for Him, not knowing that the very God of their forefathers &#151; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob &#151; was immediately in front of them in the form of a Slave who desired to serve them. Blinded by their traditional religion from seeing Him in the divine economy, they plotted to kill Him (3:6; 11:18; 14:1); and they actually did kill Him (8:31; 10:33; 14:43, 53; 15:1, 31). ",
  "1231":"The reasoning scribes, who considered themselves to be according to the Scriptures and theology, acknowledged the Slave-Savior merely as a man, even a despised Nazarene (John 1:45-46), not realizing that the One who forgave the sins of the paralytic was the very forgiving God incarnated in the form of a lowly man (see note 3 in Matt. 9), who came as a Slave to serve them with His salvation. ",
  "1232":"The Slave-Savior knew the seekers' faith, the sick one's sins (v. 5), and the scribes' inward reasoning; this indicates that He was omniscient. Such omniscience, which manifested His divine attribute, unveiled His deity, showing that He is the omniscient God. See note 2 in ch. 11. ",
  "1233":"See note 5 in Matt. 9. ",
  "1234":"The Slave-Savior was the very God incarnated. As such, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped. Outwardly, He was in the likeness and fashion of man, even in the form of a slave, but inwardly, He was God (Phil. 2:6-7). He was the Slave-Savior, and the God-Savior as well. Hence, He had not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins. In this incident, although He as God forgave people's sins, He asserted that He was the Son of Man. This indicates that He was the true God and a real man, possessing deity and humanity. In Him men could see both His divine attributes and His human virtues. ",
  "1235":"See note 5 in Matt. 9. This was the healing of the paralytic. See note 31 in ch. 1. ",
  "1236":"This is the fulfillment of the Slave-Savior's word, \"Rise, take up your mat.\" It was easier to say, \"Your sins are forgiven,\" than to say, \"Rise and take up your mat and walk.\" Since the latter word was fulfilled, surely the former also, the easier one, had been fulfilled. This is strong evidence that the Slave-Savior has authority to forgive sins on earth. ",
  "1237":"See note 6 in Matt. 9. ",
  "1238":"See note 6 in Matt. 9. ",
  "1239":"See note 21 in ch. 1. ",
  "1240":"For vv. 14-17, see notes in Matt. 9:9-13. ",
  "1241":"A tollhouse, where taxes for the Romans were collected. Matthew was one of the tax collectors (Matt. 10:3), probably in a high position. Tax collectors were condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews (Luke 18:11; Matt. 5:46 and note 2). Yet Matthew was called by the Slave-Savior and was later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles (3:18). What mercy! ",
  "1242":"As an answer to the Slave-Savior's call, this action implied that he was abandoning his dirty job and his sinful life. ",
  "1243":"See note 6. The scribes were self-righteous in condemning the Slave-Savior for His feasting with tax collectors and sinners. ",
  "1244":"This indicates that the Slave-Savior considered Himself a Physician to the people who were sick with sins. ",
  "1245":"This indicates that the Slave-Savior, as the Savior of sinners, came to save only sinners. ",
  "1246":"For vv. 18-22, see notes in Matt. 9:14-17. ",

  "1250":"Man was not created for the Sabbath; rather, the Sabbath was ordained for man that he might enjoy it with God (Gen. 2:2-3). ",
  "1251":"This shows the Slave-Savior's deity in His humanity. He, the Son of Man, was the very God who had ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath. ",
  "1252":"For vv. 1-6, see notes in Matt. 12:9-14. ",
  "1253":"This implied that the Slave-Savior was the Emancipator, who set the suffering one free from the bondage of religious ritual. ",
  "1254":"Lit., soul. ",
  "1255":"Toward the opposers the Savior's anger was exercised, and He was greatly grieved at their hardness; but toward the sick His compassion was exercised, and He restored the withered member. His anger and grief may be considered the expression of the genuineness of His humanity, whereas His compassion and healing were a merging of His human virtue with His divine power, which were manifested simultaneously to men. Thus, His deity in His humanity was again expressed before men. See note 14 in ch. 10. ",
  "1256":"See note 31 in ch. 1. The restoration of the withered hand displayed the power of the Slave-Savior's deity. ",
  "1257":"See note 6 in ch. 2. ",
  "1258":"The Slave-Savior needed first the sea (v. 7) and then a little boat to escape the pressing of the crowd, indicating that the crowd's thronging Him was a frustration to His gospel service. ",
  "1259":"See note 31 in ch. 1. ",
  "1260":"Lit., scourges. A metaphor for afflictions, calamities. ",
  "1261":"Lit., fell upon. ",
  "1262":"The demons' crying out concerning the Slave-Savior was a further frustration to His gospel service. He charged them not to make Him known. ",

  "1264":"See note 12 in Rev. 21. ",
  "1265":"Some MSS omit, whom He also named apostles. ",
  "1266":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "1267":"See note 23 in ch. 1. To preach (v. 14) the gospel was to minister God to people; to cast out demons was to keep Satan away from people. These constituted the main purpose of the Slave-Savior's gospel service. ",
  "1268":"For vv. 16-19, see notes in Matt. 10:2-4. ",
  "1269":"Lit., placed on, or, put on. So in v. 17. ",
  "1270":"Greek from Aramaic. A name added to James and John because of their impetuosity (cf. Luke 9:54-55; Mark 9:38 and note). ",
  "1271":"Lit., delivered Him up. So throughout the book. ",
  "1272":"Some MSS read, they came. ",
  "1273":"This indicates the busyness, diligence, and faithfulness of the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God in His evangelistic service. ",
  "1274":"For vv. 22-30, see notes in Matt. 12:24-32. ",
  "1275":"See note 6 in ch. 2. ",
  "1276":"This was a word of blasphemy ushered in by the exclamation of natural concern in v. 21. ",
  "1277":"The Slave-Savior cast out demons, the evil workers for the dark kingdom of Satan, yet the opposers said that He did it by the ruler of the demons. What a subtlety of the evil one, who motivated these evil opposers to say this! They were the co-workers of the evil one and even were one with him. ",
  "1278":"This indicates that Satan has not only a house but also a kingdom. His house is a house of sin (1 John 3:8, 10), and his kingdom is a kingdom of darkness (Col. 1:13). The sinners belong to both his house and his kingdom. The demons belong to his kingdom and possess people for his kingdom. ",
  "1279":"Sinners kept in Satan's house for his kingdom. The Slave-Savior bound Satan, the strong man, and entered into his house to plunder the sinners so that through regeneration they could be brought into the house of God (Eph. 2:19) for the kingdom of God (John 3:5). ",
  "1280":"This indicates that while the Slave-Savior was doing the gospel service, He was binding the strong man, Satan. The gospel service is a warfare to destroy Satan and his kingdom of darkness. ",
  "1281":"This shows that the Slave-Savior's gospel service, especially in casting out the demons to destroy the dark kingdom of Satan, was by the Holy Spirit, with whom He was anointed and by whom He was being led continuously in His move (Luke 4:18, 1; Mark 1:12). ",
  "1282":"A sin that will not be forgiven forever. ",
  "1283":"After the opposers' blasphemy, which was instigated by Satan, the relatives of the Slave-Savior came again to trouble Him with their natural concern for Him. Undoubtedly, this too was motivated by the evil one. ",
  "1284":"See note 48 in Matt. 12. This indicated the Slave-Savior's rejection of His relatives' natural concern. To defeat the evil one's schemes and to fulfill His gospel service, He refused to remain in any relationship in the natural life. This displayed His absoluteness for God in His humanity. ",
  "1285":"See note 50 in Matt. 12. ",
  "1286":"Through His gospel service the Slave-Savior made the believing sinners His spiritual relatives, who became His many brothers (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11) in the house of God (Heb. 3:5) and His many members for the building up of His mystical Body (Eph. 5:30; 1 Cor. 12:12) to do the will of God. ",
  "1287":"For vv. 1-12, see notes in Matt. 13:1-15. ",
  "1288":"See note 21 in ch. 1. So for taught in the next verse. ",
  "1289":"Signifying the Slave-Savior (Matt. 13:37), who was the Son of God coming to sow Himself as the seed of life (see note 26) in His word (v. 14) into men's hearts that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them. ",
  "1290":"This sowing was the Slave-Savior's proclaiming of the gospel of God, which brought in the kingdom of God (1:14-15). It was, as in v. 26, the sowing of the seed of life in the word (v. 14) spoken by the Slave-Savior, indicating that His gospel service was to sow the divine life into the people whom He served. The growth of this life depends on the condition of the ones served, and its issue differs according to their various conditions, as portrayed in this parable. ",
  "1291":"God's economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, which has been unveiled to the Slave-Savior's disciples. Yet since the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine, and the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and the divine light (see notes 3 26 and 21) the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age (Rom. 14:17), is still entirely a mystery to the natural man. Divine revelation is required to understand it. ",
  "1292":"Or, are done, become. ",
  "1293":"The first know here denotes the inward, subjective understanding; the second denotes the outward, objective knowledge. ",
  "1294":"The lamp here, which shines light, indicates that the Slave-Savior's gospel service not only sows life into the people whom He serves but also brings light to them. Hence, such a divine service issues in the believers as luminaries (Phil. 2:15) and the churches as lampstands (Rev. 1:20) that shine as His testimony in this dark age and consummate in the New Jerusalem, which has the outstanding characteristics of life and light (Rev. 22:1-2; 21:11, 23-24). ",
  "1295":"See note 15 in Matt. 5. ",
  "1296":"See note 15 in Matt. 5. ",
  "1297":"In Matt. 7:2 and Luke 6:38 this word is applied to the way we treat others. Here it is applied to the way we hear the word of the Lord. The measure that can be given to us by the Lord depends on the measure of our hearing. As much as we can hear, that much He will give. ",
  "1298":"The word here, as in Matt. 13:10-13 and Luke 8:18, is concerned with how we hear the word of the Lord. ",
  "1299":"The kingdom of God is the reality of the church, which is brought forth by the resurrection life of Christ through the gospel (1 Cor. 4:15). Regeneration is the entrance to the kingdom (John 3:5), and the growth of the divine life within the believers is the kingdom's development (2 Pet. 1:3-11). See note 15 in ch. 1. ",
  "1300":"The Slave-Savior as the sower. See note 3. ",
  "1301":"The seed of the divine life (1 John 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:23) sown into the Slave-Savior's believers, indicating that the kingdom of God, which is the issue and goal of the Slave-Savior's gospel, and the church in this age (Rom. 14:17) are a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest; they are not a matter of lifeless organization produced through man's wisdom and ability. The apostles' words in 1 Cor. 3:6-9 and Rev. 14:4, 15-16 confirm this. ",
  "1302":"The words sleeps and rises night and day and how, he does not know should not be applied to the Slave-Savior. This verse illustrates the spontaneity of the growth of the seed (cf. v. 28). ",
  "1303":"I.e., grows. ",
  "1304":"I.e., the good earth (v. 8), signifying the good heart that was created by God (Gen. 1:31) so that His divine life can grow in man. Such a good heart works together with the seed of the divine life sown into it, allowing the seed to grow and bear fruit spontaneously for the expression of God. The word here enables us to have faith in this spontaneity. Thus, here, in contrast to Matt. 13:24-30, tares are not mentioned, on the negative side. ",
  "1305":"Or, spontaneously. ",
  "1306":"Signifying the angels sent by the Lord to reap the harvest (Rev. 14:16; Matt. 13:39). ",
  "1307":"For vv. 30-32, see notes in Matt. 13:31-32. ",
  "1308":"Some MSS read, compare. ",
  "1309":"What is signified by the seed in vv. 3 and 26 and the lamp in v. 21 discloses the nature and inward reality of the kingdom of God; whereas what is signified by the mustard seed's becoming great, contrary to its kind, and the birds' roosting under its shade speaks of the corruption and outward appearance of the kingdom of God. ",
  "1310":"These parables display the Slave-Savior's divine wisdom and knowledge (Matt. 13:34-35). ",
  "1311":"For vv. 36-41, see notes in Matt. 8:23-27. ",
  "1312":"The Slave-Savior was sleeping and resting in the boat, which was being beaten by the windstorm, while the disciples were threatened by the storm. This indicates that He was above the threatening windstorm and was not bothered by it. As long as the disciples had Him with them in their boat, they should, by faith in Him (v. 40), have shared His rest and enjoyed His peace. ",
  "1313":"While the disciples were following Him, the Slave-Savior, as a man with divine authority, controlled the storm that threatened them. ",
  "1314":"This not only displayed the Slave-Savior's divine authority but also testified that He was the very Creator of the universe (Gen. 1:9; Job 38:8-11). He is the Creator, the One who has the authority! ",
  "1315":"For vv. 1-20, see notes in Matt. 8:28-34. In Mark the record of these events is much more detailed than in Matthew. This is strong evidence that Mark's Gospel, as a biography of the Slave of God, stresses His work instead of His word, giving more details than the other Gospels. ",
  "1316":"Tombs are places connected with death and Hades (Psa. 88:3, 5). ",
  "1317":"This indicates that the possessed man was usurped by the unclean spirit to the extent that he was being used by the spirit as if he were the spirit himself. ",

  "1322":"A district of ten cities. ",
  "1323":"For vv. 22-43, see notes in Matt. 9:18-26. In this record of the miraculous deeds of the Slave of God in His gospel service, Mark again gives more details than Matthew. It is a vivid presentation, portraying especially the sufferings of the sick, the Slave-Savior's tenderness and kindness toward them in His saving service, and Peter's presence. ",
  "1324":"Lit., saved. ",
  "1325":"Since this woman's case is merged with the case of the ruler's daughter, and since the twelve years of the woman's sickness are the age of the girl, and both are females, one older, one younger, these cases can be considered a complete case of one person. In this view the girl was born, so to speak, in the woman's death-sickness and died of it. When the woman's death-sickness was healed by the Savior, the dead girl rose up from death. This signifies that every fallen person is born in the death-sickness of sin and is dead in sin (Eph. 2:1). When his death-sickness of sin is dealt with by the Savior's redeeming death (1 Pet. 2:24), he rises up out of death into life (John 5:24-25). ",
  "1326":"Or, made whole; lit., saved. Sickness is an oppression exercised over the sick by the devil. Hence, the Slave-Savior's healing was a saving service rendered to the suffering victim that she might enjoy relief and release from the evil one's oppression (Acts 10:38). See note 31 in ch. 1. ",
  "1327":"The Slave-Savior was God incarnated to be a man (John 1:1, 14). His garments signify His perfect behavior in His humanity &#151; His perfection in His human virtues. To touch His garments was actually to touch Him in His humanity, in which God was embodied (Col. 2:9). By such a touch His divine power was transfused, through the perfection of His humanity, into the one who had touched Him, and it became her healing. The God who dwells in unapproachable light became touchable in the Slave-Savior through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment. This was the service of the Slave-Savior, as the Slave of God, to the sick sinner. ",
  "1328":"The pressing crowd did not receive anything from the Savior, but the one who touched Him did. ",
  "1329":"Fear is inward, whereas trembling is shown outwardly. ",
  "1330":"The Slave-Savior's power in healing expressed His deity (v. 30 and note); His word, given with love and kindness in sympathy, expressed His humanity. In this case His deity and His humanity again were merged for His expression. ",
  "1331":"See note 28. ",
  "1332":"Lit., into. ",

  "1337":"See note 21 in ch. 1. So for this verb throughout this chapter. ",
  "1338":"See note 55 in Matt. 13. The blind despisers' word here may be considered a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isa. 53:2-3 concerning the Slave-Savior: \"As a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men.\" To know Him in that way was to know Him in His humanity according to the flesh (2 Cor. 5:16), not in His deity according to the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). In His humanity He was a root out of dry ground, a twig out of the stem of Jesse and a Branch out of his roots (Isa. 11:1), a Branch unto David (Jer. 23:5; 33:15), the Branch who was a man and the Servant of Jehovah (Zech. 3:8; 6:12), One who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh (Rom. 1:3). In His deity He was the Shoot of Jehovah for beauty and glory (Isa. 4:2), the Son of God marked out in power according to the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). ",

The Slave-Savior's healing salvation is well able to heal the deafness and dumbness of such a one, first by dealing with his ears and then by touching his tongue. ",
  "1390":"Or, thrust. The Slave-Savior's thrusting of His fingers into the deaf one's ears signifies His dealing with his hearing organ (cf. Isa. 50:4-5; Job 33:14-16), and His touching of his tongue with His spittle signifies His anointing of the dumb one's speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of His mouth.

  "1407":"The Slave-Savior's humanity was expressed here in His intimate and loving care for the needy one. See note 36 in ch. 9. ",
  "1408":"This may indicate that the Slave-Savior would not allow what He intended to do for this blind man to be seen and known by the crowd, since He charged him not even to enter into the village (v. 26). Spiritually, this may indicate that the Slave-Savior wanted the blind man to have a private and intimate time with Him so that He could infuse him with the element by which his sight could be recovered. All who are spiritually blind need such a time with the Slave-Savior. ",
  "1409":"Blindness is related to darkness (Acts 26:18). To see, there is the need of light. The Slave-Savior's spittle may signify the word that proceeds out of His mouth (see note 6 in John 9), a word that conveys the divine light of life to the receiver for the recovery of his sight. Such spitting by the Slave-Savior, accompanied by His laying on of hands, was much richer than His mere touch, which had been requested for the blind man by his helpers. ",
  "1410":"Indicating that the Slave-Savior identified Himself with the blind man in order to transfuse His healing element into him. ",

  "1433":"Lit., upon, or, on; i.e., on the basis of, according to. ",
  "1434":"This shows that the Slave-Savior became one with the young children. ",
  "1435":"This was an impetuous act by John, the son of thunder; it was contrary to the virtue of the Slave-Savior whom he accompanied (see note 17 in ch. 3). John's attitude was like that of Joshua in Num. 11:28. ",
  "1436":"This displayed the Slave-Savior's tolerance, in the practice of the gospel service, toward those believers who were different from the ones closer to Him. In this respect the attitude of the apostle Paul in Phil. 1:16-18 and that of Moses in Num. 11:26-29, but not that of the impetuous John, are like His. It is very meaningful that this section, vv. 38-50, continues the previous section, vv. 33-37, in which the Slave-Savior taught His followers humility because they had argued with one another concerning who was greater. In that argument the two sons of thunder, James and John, probably played the leading roles (cf. 10:35-45). Here the same John would not tolerate a differing believer. His impetuous action was probably related to his ambition to be great. It might have been this ambition that caused his intolerance toward the different practice of other believers. This is a basic divisive factor among Christians. The Slave-Savior surely would not go along with John in this matter. ",
  "1437":"This word does not contradict that in Matt. 12:30. Both issued from the Slave-Savior's mouth and can be considered maxims. The maxim here speaks of outward conformity in practice and is in regard to people who are not against Him (Mark 9:39); that in Matthew speaks of the inward unity of purpose and is in regard to people who are against Him (Matt. 12:24). To maintain the inward unity, we need to practice the word in Matthew, and as to the outward conformity, we should practice the word here, tolerating believers who differ from us. ",
  "1438":"John behaved as one who acted upon others. The Slave-Savior's wise word here turned him and the other disciples, making them those acted upon by others. This implied that all &#151; whether the disciples or other believers &#151; were under the Lord's care because all were His. Whether it was their treatment of other believers or other believers' treatment of them, anything done in the Lord's name, even the giving of a cup of water, would be rewarded by Him. ",
  "1439":"This indicates that the Slave-Savior recognized that the one forbidden by John was a genuine believer belonging to Him. This should have been a lesson to John. ",
  "1440":"This reward will be given in the coming kingdom age (Luke 14:14). See notes 35 in Heb. 10 and 10 in 2 Cor. 5. ",
  "1441":"Here the Slave-Savior turned the subject from John and the other disciples to His believers in general, all of whom He considered little ones (not related to the little children in v. 37), including John, the other disciples, and the one forbidden by them. This may be considered a warning to John and the other disciples not to stumble any one of His believers who followed Him in a different way. ",
  "1442":"Lit., millstone (turned) by a donkey. ",
  "1443":"Here the one who causes the stumbling is changed from a person to a member of the believer's fleshly body. The believers should not stumble one another, nor should they be stumbled by their own fleshly members. This indicates the preciousness of the believers in the eyes of the Slave-Savior. They should all be fully preserved for Him. All the factors that could cause the believers to stumble should be dealt with seriously. ",
  "1444":"See note 29 in Matt. 5. So in v. 45. ",
  "1445":"Life here refers to eternal life, which the overcoming believers will enjoy in the coming kingdom (10:30; cf. note 29 in Matt. 19). To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom (v. 47) and participate there in the enjoyment of eternal life. ",
  "1446":"See note 22 in Matt. 5. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "1447":"In apposition to Gehenna and denoting here, according to the context, a dispensational punishment of the defeated believers (such as being hurt of the second death, mentioned in Rev. 2:11); it is not eternal perdition. See note 49. ",
  "1448":"Some MSS insert v. 44, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. ",
  "1449":"Some MSS add, into unquenchable fire. ",
  "1450":"Some MSS insert v. 46, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. ",
  "1451":"This is to enter into the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming age. See note 43. ",
  "1452":"The word given here and in vv. 44 and 46 (which were inserted in some MSS), not found in Matt. 5:29-30; 18:8-9, or in Luke 12:5, is quoted from Isa. 66:24. ",
  "1453":"I.e., to kill and eliminate the germs of corruption that came in through sin, in order to preserve the sinning believers (cf. Lev. 2:13; Ezek. 43:24). ",
  "1454":"This is the refining fire (Mal. 3:2), the purifying, purging fire, as in 1 Cor. 3:13, 15 (cf. Isa. 33:14), which, as a dispensational punishment in the kingdom age, will purge the believers who commit sin and are unrepentant in this age (see note 43). Even in this age God purges the believers through trials as if by fire (1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12, 17). Dispensational punishment by fire in the coming age is in the same principle as God's chastisement through sufferings as if by fire in this age. ",
  "1455":"Some MSS add, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. ",
  "1456":"See note 13 in Matt. 5. The application of the word here differs from that in Matt. 5:13 and Luke 14:34. In Matthew and Luke, salt, portraying the believers' influence on the world, is for the salting of the corrupted world; salt here, in apposition to the purging fire, is for the salting of sinning believers, even as God's chastisements are for the sinning believers in this age. Hence, the believers should have salt in themselves that they may be purified not only from sins but also from any divisive element (such as was displayed by the impetuous John in forbidding a differing brother and in arguing for greatness) and may thus be at peace with one another. Such purging salt purges the believers' speech that they may keep peace with one another (Col. 4:6). The Lord's word here indicates that John's speech to the brother who differed from him had not been purged. Thus, the entire section, vv. 38-50, presents the Slave-Savior's teaching concerning the believers' being tolerant for the sake of unity. ",
  "1457":"See note 13 in Matt. 5. ",
  "1458":"The Slave-Savior ministered in His gospel service for over three years in the despised region of Galilee (see note 14 par. 2, in ch. 1), far from the holy temple and the holy city, the place where He had to die for the accomplishing of God's eternal plan. As the Lamb of God (John 1:29), He had to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God's provision of a ram as a substitute for his son (Gen. 22:2, 9-14) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem (2 Chron. 3:1). It had to be there that He would be delivered, according to the counsel determined by the Trinity of the Godhead (Acts 2:23), to the Jewish leaders (9:31; 10:33) and be rejected by them as the builders of God's building (8:31; Acts 4:11). It had to be there that He would be crucified according to the Roman form of capital punishment (John 18:31-32 and note; 19:6, 14-15) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die (Num. 21:8-9; John 3:14). Moreover, according to Daniel's prophecy (Dan. 9:24-26), that very year was the year that Messiah (Christ) was to be cut off (killed). Furthermore, as the Passover lamb (1 Cor. 5:7), He had to be killed in the month of the Passover (Exo. 12:1-11). Hence, He had to go to Jerusalem (v. 33; 11:1, 11, 15, 27; John 12:12) before the Passover (John 12:1; Mark 14:1) that He might die there on the day of the Passover (14:12-17; John 18:28) at the place and the time foreordained by God.

Since the time for His death was at hand (see note 1) He went to Jerusalem willingly, even going before His followers with a speed and boldness that amazed them (v. 32). This was His obedience to God unto death (Phil. 2:8), according to the counsel of God (Acts 2:23), for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan (Isa. 53:10). The Slave-Savior knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:25-26) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (John 12:23-24; Rom. 8:29). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame (Heb. 12:2) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and to be condemned by them to death. For this, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand (16:19; Acts 2:33-35), bestowed on Him the name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9-10), made Him both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), and crowned Him with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9).

The cup signifies that His death was the portion given to Him by God, the portion He took to redeem sinners for God. Baptism denotes that His death was ordained by God as the way for Him to pass through for the accomplishing of God's redemption for sinners. For us He willingly drank this cup and was baptized with this baptism. ",
  "1478":"This is the strongest expression stating that the Slave-Savior, as the Son of Man in His humanity, was a Slave of God to serve sinners even by giving His life. ",
  "1479":"Or, soul. ",

  "1489":"Signifying people's conduct and the virtues expressed in people's conduct (see Isa. 64:6; Rev. 19:8). The disciples put their garments on the colt for the Lord to ride on, and many spread their garments in the road for Him to pass through (v. 8), signifying, on the one hand, that they revered Him and, on the other hand, that their conduct, which was an expression of their human virtues, was a seat on which He could rest and a way that He could pass through (see Matt. 21:7 and note 1). Our deeds and our conduct should pave the way for the Lord and serve as a seat on which He can rest. ",
  "1490":"This shows not only that the branches were many and thick but also that people could walk on them securely. ",

Here the crowd spread layers of this kind of branch as a carpet on the road so that the Slave-Savior, whom they revered and loved, could walk on them as He entered the capital. ",

  "1494":"In this section, vv. 12-26, the record of the Slave-Savior's cursing of the fig tree and the record of His cleansing of the temple were merged, indicating His dealing simultaneously with different aspects of the corrupted and rebellious nation of Israel. The fig tree was the symbol of the nation of Israel (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8), and the temple was the center of Israel's relationship with God. As a fig tree planted by God, the nation of Israel did not bear fruit for Him, and as the center of Israel's relationship with God, the temple was filled with corruption. Hence, the Slave-Savior cursed the fruitless fig tree and cleansed the contaminated temple. Such a dealing can be considered a harbinger of the destruction foretold in 12:9 and 13:2. ",
  "1495":"Lit., for the age. ",
  "1496":"In His ministry for the spreading of the gospel in Galilee in 1:14--10:52, the Slave-Savior's work was to proclaim the gospel, teach the truth, cast out demons, and heal the sick. In that work His human virtues with His divine attributes were expressed as His qualification for and beauty in His divine service rendered to sinners for God. In His preparation in Jerusalem for His redemptive work (11:15--14:42), His major work was to confront the opposing Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders of God's building (12:9-10) but had actually been usurped by God's enemy, Satan, and instigated by him to plot to kill Him. In this confrontation, under their subtle and evil questioning, testing, and examining, His human dignity was expressed in His human genuineness (vv. 15-18), and His divine wisdom and authority were expressed in His human conduct and perfection (11:27--12:37), so that eventually His faultfinders became His quality-provers. This paved the way for Him to point out to these blind opposers that He, the Christ, the Son of David, was the Lord of David, that is, the very God (12:35-37), that they might know His deity in His humanity, that is, that He was God living in man.

The Slave-Savior also, as the real Passover Lamb (1 Cor. 5:7), was examined for four days before He was killed. He came to Bethany six days before the Passover (John 12:1; Mark 11:1). On the next day He came into Jerusalem and went back to Bethany (John 12:12; Mark 11:11). On the third day He came to Jerusalem again (11:12-15) and began to be examined according to the Jewish law by the leaders of the Jews (11:27--12:37; 14:53-65; John 18:13, 19-24) and according to the Roman law by Pilate, the Roman governor (John 18:28--19:6; see note 1 in Mark 15). He was examined until the day of the Passover, when He was crucified (14:12; John 18:28; see note 12 in Mark 14). This insidious and ensnaring examination, coming from many angles, took exactly four days, and He passed, proving that He was fully qualified to be the Lamb required by God for the accomplishing of His redemption, that He may pass over the sinners, both Jews and Gentiles. See notes 1 in ch. 15, 2 in Matt. 26, and 13 in John 18. ",

Immediately after such a preparation, He was arrested to be crucified (14:43--15:28). ",
  "1527":"Or, what manner of stones ... ",
  "1528":"In preparing the disciples for His death, the Slave-Savior in this chapter told them first the things to come, the things that would take place in the world during the church age, from His resurrection to His coming back. Concerning the days to come, He did not leave them in darkness; rather, He told them (1) concerning the destruction of the temple, which would occur in A.D. 70 (vv. 1-2); (2) concerning the plagues at the beginning of birth pangs, which would begin after His ascension and continue until the great tribulation (vv. 3-8); (3) concerning the preaching of the gospel and the persecutions in the church age (vv. 9-13); (4) concerning the great tribulation and His second coming, both of which will take place in the last three and a half years of this age (vv. 14-27); and (5) concerning watching, praying, and awaiting the Slave-Savior throughout the church age (vv. 28-37).

During the evening of the last Passover day, first the Slave-Savior ate the Passover feast with His disciples and instituted His supper for them (vv. 12-25); then He went with the disciples to the Garden of Gethsemane at the Mount of Olives (vv. 26-42). He was arrested there and brought to the high priest, where He was judged by the Sanhedrin late in the night (vv. 43-72). In the morning of the same day, He was delivered to Pilate to be judged by him and was sentenced to death (15:1-15). Then He was brought to Golgotha and was crucified there at 9:00 a.m., remaining on the cross until 3:00 p.m. (15:16-41), for the fulfillment of the type of the Passover (Exo. 12:6-11; see note 37 in Mark 12).

He did not participate in the Slave-Savior's body and blood, because he was not a real believer in Him but a son of perdition (John 17:12), considered by the Slave-Savior even a devil (John 6:70-71). Luke 22:21-23 seems to indicate that Judas left after the Lord's supper, which is mentioned in Luke 22:19-20. However, Mark's record, like Matthew's, shows that Judas was identified by the Slave-Savior as His betrayer (vv. 18-21) before He instituted His supper (vv. 22-24). Mark's record is according to historical sequence, whereas Luke's sequence is according to morality. See note 16 par. 2, in Matt. 8. ",
  "1560":"This refers to His going to die. ",
  "1561":"For vv. 22-26, see notes in Matt. 26:26-30. ",
  "1562":"This was the eating of the Slave-Savior's supper, after He and His followers had eaten the Passover feast in vv. 16-18. He initiated this new feast, which was for His believers' remembrance of Him, to replace the Passover feast, the old testament feast for the elect's remembrance of Jehovah's salvation (Exo. 12:14; 13:3). This new feast of the new testament is for the remembering of the Slave-Savior through the eating of the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers (1 Cor. 11:24), and the drinking of the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins (Matt. 26:28). The bread denotes life (John 6:35), the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing (1 Cor. 10:16), which is God Himself as the believers' portion (Psa. 16:5). As sinners, the believers should have had the cup of God's wrath as their portion (Rev. 14:10). But the Slave-Savior drank that cup for them (John 18:11), and His salvation became their portion, the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13) that runs over (Psa. 23:5), the content of which is God as the believers' all-inclusive blessing. Such a bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior's supper, which is a table (1 Cor. 10:21), a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. Thus, as His believers remember Him, they display His redeeming and life-imparting death (1 Cor. 11:26 &#151; His blood separated from His body declares His death), testifying to the entire universe of His rich and marvelous salvation. ",
  "1563":"In Exo. 24:3-8 God made a covenant with redeemed Israel (Heb. 9:18-21), which became the old testament, as a base from which He could deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law. The Slave-Savior came to accomplish God's eternal redemption for God's chosen people by His death, according to God's will (Heb. 10:7, 9-10), and with His blood He instituted a new covenant, a better covenant (Heb. 8:6-13), which after His resurrection became the new testament (Heb. 9:16-17), as a base from which God can be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace. This new covenant replaced the old covenant and at the same time changed God's old dispensation to His new dispensation. The Slave-Savior wanted His followers to know this and to live a life based on this and according to this after His resurrection. ",

  "1569":"The Slave-Savior's sorrow and His prayer here are the same as in John 12:27. There He said that He had come for this hour; that is, He knew that the Father's will was that He should die on the cross for the fulfillment of God's eternal plan. ",
  "1570":"The Triune God determined in His divine plan in eternity past that the Second of the Divine Trinity should be incarnated and die on the cross to accomplish His eternal redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose (Eph. 1:7-9). Hence, before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past (1 Pet. 1:19-20), the Second of the Divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29); and in the eyes of God He was slain as the Lamb of God from the foundation of the world, that is, from the creation of God's creatures, who became fallen (Rev. 13:8). From the time of man's fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used as types for God's chosen people (Gen. 3:21; 4:4; 8:20; 22:13; Exo. 12:3-8; Lev. 1:2), pointing to Him who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God. In the fullness of time the Triune God sent the Second of the Divine Trinity, the Son of God, to come in incarnation to take a human body (Heb. 10:5) that He might be offered to God on the cross (Heb. 9:14; 10:12) to do the will of the Triune God (Heb. 10:7), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God's chosen people (Heb. 10:9-10). In His prayer here, immediately before His crucifixion, He prepared Himself to take the cup of the cross (Matt. 26:39, 42), being willing to do this unique will of the Father for the accomplishing of the eternal plan of the Triune God. ",
  "1571":"This was Peter (John 18:10, 26). ",
  "1572":"The God-forsaking and God-offending opposers, afraid of the people who warmly welcomed the Slave-Savior (11:7-11) and were gladdened by His speaking (12:37), dared not arrest Him in the daytime or in a public place such as the temple. Instead, they arrested Him subtly, deep in the night (v. 1), as though arresting a robber (v. 48). ",

  "1578":"The befuddled high priest of the traditional, God-forsaking and God-forsaken religion called God \"the Blessed\" in order to show how much he revered and honored God. ",
  "1579":"Concerning His behavior the Slave-Savior would not answer His faultfinders' false accusation, yet concerning His divine person, His deity, He was not silent but answered strongly and definitely, affirming His deity in His humanity by stating that as the Son of Man He would sit at the right hand of God. ",
  "1580":"Lit., tunics. Because the Greek word is plural, garments is a more suitable rendering here. ",
  "1581":"The blind opposers condemned the Slave-Savior for being blasphemous in affirming His deity, not realizing that actually it was they who were blaspheming God, who was the very One whom they were slandering and mocking at that moment. ",
  "1582":"This was the Jews' despising and rejecting of the Slave-Savior to the uttermost, as prophesied in Isa. 53:3. ",

  "1619":"The Slave-Savior's resurrection is proof that God is satisfied with what He accomplished through His death (see note 25 in Rom. 4); it is also a confirmation of the effectiveness of His redeeming and life-imparting death (Acts 2:24; 3:15). His resurrection became the evidence of our justification (Rom. 4:25) and the power by which we could be freed from sin (1 Cor. 15:17). ",
  "1620":"In the angel's message to the three sisters who discovered the resurrection of the Slave-Savior, the phrase and Peter is inserted only in Mark's record. This is probably due to Peter's influence on the contents of this Gospel. In any case, this phrase indicates that Peter's intimate relationship with the Slave-Savior was particular, so that it was stressed even by the angel. ",
  "1621":"Many ancient MSS omit vv. 9-20. ",
  "1622":"See note 23 in ch. 1. So in v. 17. ",
  "1623":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "1624":"This reveals that God's redemption, accomplished by the Slave-Savior through His death and resurrection, is not only for man, the leading one in God's creation, but also for all the creation. Hence, all things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to (in) all creation under heaven (Col. 1:20, 23). Based on this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:19-22). ",
  "1625":"To believe (see note 15 in ch. 1) is to receive the Slave-Savior (John 1:12) not only for forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43) but also for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:21, 23). Those who thus believe become the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of the Slave-Savior and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through the Slave-Savior's resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance preached by John (1:4; Acts 19:3-5). To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (the Spirit) &#151; 1 Cor. 10:2; 12:13. ",
  "1626":"Here the verse does not say, \"He who does not believe and is not baptized.\" This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing, by itself, is sufficient in order to receive salvation from condemnation; yet for the completion of one's inward salvation, believing needs baptism as an outward affirmation. ",
  "1627":"Speaking with new tongues is only one of the five signs that accompany saved believers. It is not the unique sign, contrary to what is stressed by some believers. According to the divine revelation in the Acts and the Epistles, what the Lord said here does not mean that every saved believer should have all five signs. It means that each saved believer may have some of these signs but will not necessarily have all. ",
  "1628":"The Slave-Savior's ascension for His exaltation by God was a sign of God's acceptance of all He had done for God's eternal plan according to God's New Testament economy (Acts 2:33-36). In this exaltation God crowned Him with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9), bestowed on Him the name that is above all names (Phil. 2:9), and made Him the Lord of all (Acts 2:36) and the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22) that He may have all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18) to rule over the heavens, the earth, and the nations so that they can work together for the universal spreading of His gospel service. ",
  "1629":"See note 14 in ch. 1. This preaching of God's gospel to all the creation (v. 15) by the resurrected and ascended Slave-Savior, the Slave of God, through His believers began from Jerusalem and has been proceeding to the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8) continuously and universally through the past centuries, and will continue to proceed until He comes to set up the kingdom of God on earth (Luke 19:12; Dan. 7:13-14). ",
  "1630":"Or, Since, as is well known, ... ",
  "1631":"This indicates that there were more than four who wrote an account of the Savior's earthly life. ",

  "1634":"The first group of New Testament believers, composed of those who were with the Savior during His ministry on earth. ",
  "1635":"Lit., servants; i.e., official servants, apparitors, who attend or serve an officer or authority to carry out his orders. The Greek word is used in 4:20; Matt. 5:25; Mark 14:54; Acts 26:16; and 1 Cor. 4:1. ",
  "1636":"The word of the gospel, ministered and preached to people (Acts 6:4; 8:4). ",
  "1637":"This indicates that the writer of this Gospel was not among those disciples who were with the Savior during His earthly life. ",
  "1638":"The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and the Acts. Luke's authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile (Col. 4:14; cf. Col. 4:11), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician (Col. 4:14). Beginning in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys (Acts 16:10-17; 20:5--21:18; 27:1--28:15). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul's martyrdom (Philem. 24; 2 Tim. 4:11). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul's views, as Mark's represents Peter's (see note 1 par. 1, in Mark 1). <br><br>   The Gospels of Luke, Matthew, and Mark are synoptic in regard to the Savior's humanity (see note 1 par. 2, in Mark 1). Luke's Gospel reveals God among men in His saving grace given to fallen mankind. Its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect man. It gives a complete genealogy of the man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind, and shows that He is a genuine descendant of man &#151; a son of man (see note 1 pars. 2 and 3, in Matt. 1). Its record of the life of this man impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, this Gospel stresses the Lord as the Man-Savior. Based on the moral principles that apply to all men, it presents gospel messages, as in 4:16-21; 7:41-43; 12:14-21; and 13:2-5; gospel parables, as in 10:30-37; 14:16-24; 15:3-32; and 18:9-14; and gospel cases, as in 7:36-50; 13:10-17; 16:19-31; 19:1-10; and 23:39-43. None of these are recorded in the other Gospels. In contrast to Matthew, Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background. It is the Gospel written to mankind in general, and it announces the good news to all people (2:10). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish but Gentile (4:25-28). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jewish and Gentile. As such, the sequence of its record is according to morality, not according to historical events. See notes 16 par. 2, in Matt. 8 and 20 in Mark 14. ",
  "1639":"The Greek word means loved by God, or friend of God. Probably a Gentile believer who occupied some official position under the Roman Empire. ",
  "1640":"This was the eighth of the twenty-four courses of priestly service ordained by David (1 Chron. 24:10). ",
  "1641":"They were among God's chosen people and had been preserved in the custody of the law in the Old Testament and brought forth by it to be useful to God for the initiation of the gospel in the New Testament. ",
  "1642":"This does not contradict Rom. 3:20. Here it means to be right, i.e., blameless, in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances (2:25; Phil. 3:6). It does not mean that these righteous ones were not sinful, without sin and sins. They were blameless, but not without blemish. They still needed the unblemished sin and trespass offerings in type (Lev. 4:28; 5:15) for their propitiation that they might have contact with God. ",
  "1643":"I.e., living according to. ",
  "1644":"The Old Testament law is generally called \"the law\"; its contents are divided into three categories: commandments, statutes, and ordinances. Commandments, as God's basic commands, are the general principles of the law. There are ten commandments (Exo. 20:2-17). Statutes, or laws, regulations, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the commandments, as recorded in Exo. 20:22-26. Ordinances, like statutes, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the commandments, and, in addition, include verdicts, as recorded in Exo. 21:1--23:19. Ordinances minus the verdicts become statutes. The Greek word for ordinances here is the same as that in Rom. 2:26 and in Heb. 9:1, 10. ",
  "1645":"This was sovereign of the Lord. It afforded God an opportunity to initiate His gospel not by man's natural strength but by His divine act. ",
  "1646":"On the incense altar within the Holy Place (v. 11; Exo. 30:6-8; 1 Sam. 2:28; 1 Chron. 23:13; 2 Chron. 29:11). ",
  "1647":"The prayer of God's people affords Him a way to carry out His plan. ",
  "1648":"This indicates that Zachariah had prayed that his wife would bear him a son. This indicates also that our prayer carries out God's operation, implying that our natural strength must be brought to an end that God's operation may begin by His divine act. This was revealed in the case of Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17:15-19) and in the case of Hannah (1 Sam. 1:5-20). ",
  "1649":"Of Hebrew origin, Jehohanan contracted to Johanan (2 Kings 25:23; 1 Chron. 3:24; 2 Chron. 28:12). The Hebrew word means Jehovah is favorable, Jehovah shows grace, or Jehovah is the gracious Giver. ",
  "1650":"This indicates that John would be a Nazarite (Num. 6:1-4). He would not drink wine but would be filled with the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit replaced the wine (Eph. 5:18). ",
  "1651":"In the New Testament this is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God. Such a title is not used in the Old Testament. (In Psa. 51:11 and Isa. 63:10-11, Holy Spirit should be translated Spirit of holiness.) It was at this time, for the initiation of the gospel of God, to prepare the way for the Savior's coming and to prepare a human body for Him, that this divine title of God's Spirit was used. The preparing of the way for the Savior's coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose. The preparing of a human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God's plan of redemption. ",
  "1652":"This was the fulfillment of Mal. 4:5 (Matt. 11:14 and note 2; Mark 9:11-13). ",
  "1653":"Lit., in [the sphere of ] the prudence of the righteous. ",
  "1654":"Or, counsel. Wisdom is the inward insight, whereas prudence is the outward practical application of wisdom. Hence, prudence can be rendered counsel. ",
  "1655":"Lit., her days. ",
  "1656":"Believing opens the praising and testifying mouth (2 Cor. 4:13); unbelief keeps our tongue silent. ",
  "1657":"Galilee was a region without fame, and Nazareth was a despised city (John 7:52; 1:46). ",
  "1658":"The virgin Mary lived in a despised city in a region without fame, but she was a descendant of the royal family of King David (vv. 31-32; Matt. 1:16, notes 1 and 2). ",
  "1659":"Some MSS add, You are blessed among women. ",
  "1660":"See note 21 in Matt. 1. ",
  "1661":"A divine title, denoting the Supreme (God &#151; Gen. 14:18); hence, in Greek there is no article. Jesus is great because He is the Son of the Most High, the Supreme God. ",
  "1662":"Jesus, conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin, is the Son of the Most High God, and at the same time He is the son of a highly ranked man, David the king (Matt. 1:1; 22:45). His status is both divine and human. ",
  "1663":"Jesus will have the house of Jacob &#151; the nation of Israel &#151; as the center of His reign (Acts 1:6; 15:16), through which He will rule over the entire world as His kingdom (Rev. 11:15), first in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6) and then in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 22:3, 5). ",
  "1664":"The preceding verse unveils the family of Jesus; this verse unveils His kingdom. ",
  "1665":"See note 15. ",
  "1666":"Like the overshadowing of the cloud on the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:5) and over the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34, 38). According to this verse, it seems that the Holy Spirit would be only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the holy child. However, Matt. 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary \"was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit,\" and that \"that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.\" This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary's womb before she delivered the child Jesus. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior. <br><br>   The conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of Jesus the Savior. The conception of the Baptist was God's miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power without the involvement of the divine essence. This resulted in the bringing forth of a mere man who was filled with the Spirit of God (v. 15) but who lacked the nature of God. The conception of the Savior was God's incarnation (John 1:14), constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures &#151; divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16) and might be a Man-Savior (2:11). ",
  "1667":"As the conception was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a holy thing, intrinsically holy. This was Jesus our Savior. ",
  "1668":"Or, powerless. ",
  "1669":"Lit., from. ",
  "1670":"The forerunner exulted (v. 44) on meeting the Savior even while both of them were still in their mothers' wombs. ",
  "1671":"Elizabeth's blessing, given through the Holy Spirit (v. 41), revealed the humanity of the Savior as the fruit and the deity of the Savior as the Lord (v. 43) and confirmed Mary's faith in the Lord's word (v. 45). Such a blessing indicates that Elizabeth too was a godly woman, fit for God's use in carrying out His purpose. ",
  "1672":"Here and in Acts 2:30, fruit is used to signify Christ only in the sense of offspring. In Rev. 22:2 the same Greek word is used to signify the fruit of the tree of life. Christ is the Shoot of Jehovah (Isa. 4:2) and of David (Jer. 23:5) and the fruit of Mary and of David (Acts 2:30) that we may eat of Him as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7). ",
  "1673":"Elizabeth, being filled with the Holy Spirit (v. 41), recognized the fruit of Mary's womb as her Lord, acknowledging the deity of the child to be born of Mary (Psa. 110:1; Matt. 22:43-45). ",
  "1674":"Or, And blessed is she who believed that there will be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord. ",
  "1675":"In contrast to unbelieving Zachariah (v. 20). ",
  "1676":"This is a prophecy given by the Holy Spirit (v. 41) to confirm the Lord's word in vv. 30-37, a word spoken to Mary by the angel Gabriel. ",
  "1677":"Mary's poetic praise was composed of many quotations from the Old Testament, indicating that she was a godly woman qualified to be a channel for the Savior's incarnation, and that Jesus would grow up in a family that was filled with the knowledge and love of God's holy Word. ",
  "1678":"Mary's praise magnified the Lord based on her experience of God as her Savior through His everlasting mercy (vv. 47-50) and on her observation of others' experience of God's merciful and faithful doings (vv. 51-55). In content and standard, her praise was like some of the Old Testament psalms. However, she did not say anything concerning Christ, unlike Elizabeth in her blessing (vv. 41-43) and Zachariah in his prophecy (vv. 67-71, 76-79) spoken through the Holy Spirit. ",
  "1679":"First, Mary's spirit exulted in God; then her soul magnified the Lord. Her praise to God issued from her spirit and was expressed through her soul. Her spirit was filled with joy in God her Savior, and her soul manifested that joy for the magnifying of the Lord. She lived and acted in her spirit, which directed her soul. Her spirit's exulting in God was due to her enjoyment of God as her Savior, and her soul's magnifying of the Lord was due to her exalting of the Lord, who is Jehovah, the great To Be. ",
  "1680":"Or, Powerful. ",
  "1681":"Both Mary and Zachariah stressed God's mercy (vv. 54, 58, 72, 78; see notes 16 in Heb. 4 and 5 in Titus 3), thus acknowledging their low estate (v. 48) and humbly (v. 52) recognizing that they were not worthy to be favored by God. ",
  "1682":"Referring to God's faithfulness in keeping His word. Both Mary and Zachariah stressed not only God's mercy (see note 50) but also His faithfulness (vv. 70, 72, and note 72). God's mercy took care of their condition, and His faithfulness took care of His position so that He could favor them with His gracious doings. ",
  "1683":"See note 20. ",
  "1684":"Lit., words. ",
  "1685":"Zachariah's prophecy concerned God's redemptive move for His people unto their salvation, accomplished by the raising of Christ, in His humanity, as a horn of salvation in the house of David, and, in His divinity, as the rising sun from on high, through God's rich mercy according to His holy covenant (vv. 68-73, 76-79). Concerning the divine-human person and the saving work of the Man-Savior, his prophecy brings in more light than Elizabeth's blessing, yet it still bears an Old Testament color in the Old Testament style and flavor, like Mary's praise and Elizabeth's blessing. ",
  "1686":"Jesus the Savior, who came out of the house of David (Jer. 23:5-6). ",
  "1687":"See note 55. ",
  "1688":"Or, from the foundation of the world. ",
  "1689":"See note 50. So in v. 78. ",
  "1690":"Referring to God's faithfulness in keeping His word, which was made His covenant by His oath (v. 73). ",
  "1691":"God's covenant is enacted upon His promise (Heb. 8:6). A promise is a common, ordinary word that has not been confirmed by an oath. In the Old Testament, after God made a promise, He sealed it with an oath. He swore by His Godhead to confirm His promise. Thus His promise was made His covenant. ",
  "1692":"Lit., serve Him as priests. ",
  "1693":"The emphasis of holiness here is godliness and devoutness before God; the Greek word is different from that for holy in Rom. 1:2. Holiness is mainly toward God, and righteousness is mainly toward men. This book stresses the humanity of Jesus; hence, holiness and righteousness are singled out here as the main characteristics of man's behavior before God, by which man serves Him. ",
  "1694":"Jesus the Savior (v. 17; Mal. 3:1). ",
  "1695":"See note 3 in Mark 1. ",
  "1696":"Jesus the Savior was the dawning sun to the dark age. His coming ended the night of the Old Testament and began the day of the New Testament. As the fruit in Elizabeth's blessing (v. 42 and note 2), He is life to us (John 14:6); as the sun in Zachariah's prophecy, He is light to us (John 9:5; Matt. 4:16). As such a One, He is the Accomplisher and the center of God's redemption that His people may obtain salvation. ",
  "1697":"The forerunner's mother and father were filled with the Holy Spirit (vv. 41, 67). It was easy for their child to grow and become strong in his spirit and thereby to live in the wilderness. For him to grow and become strong in spirit means that he was with and for God, and for him to live in the wilderness means that he was apart from man's culture and religion that God might have a free and clear way to use him as the forerunner of the Savior. ",
  "1698":"This is sovereign of God, as mentioned in Prov. 21:1. By this census Mary and Joseph were brought from Nazareth to Bethlehem that the Savior might be born there for the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the place of His birth (Micah 5:2; John 7:41-42). ",
  "1699":"The royal house and family in line to inherit the throne of David (3:23-31; 1:32; cf. Matt. 1:6-16). ",
  "1700":"Luke presents a Man-Savior. After the narration of the conception of the Man-Savior, Luke gives us in this chapter an excellent record of (1) His genuine human birth, which was according to the law of God's creation of man, that He might be a Man-Savior for the salvation of man; (2) His physical circumcision, carried out according to the law of God's ordination (vv. 21-24), that He might be the legal seed of Abraham (Gen. 17:9-14), the One in whom God's promise to Abraham &#151; \"In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed\" (Gen. 12:3) &#151; as the gospel announced to him (Gal. 3:8), could be fulfilled for all the Gentiles (Gal. 3:14); (3) His physical growth, which was according to the law of human life (v. 40), that He might be a perfect man to express God for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan; and (4) His proper boyhood, during which He grew in His interest concerning the things of God, which interest was related to His deity as the Son of God the Father (vv. 40-52), that He might have the full measure of wisdom, stature, and favor with God and men. <br><br>   The record here concerning the Savior's birth and youth is very different from that in Matt. 2. What Matthew recorded of events that occurred at the Savior's birth and during His youth constitutes striking evidence of Christ's legitimate kingship. Luke also recorded the Savior's birth and youth, but what he recorded were events of a different category, events that offer strong proof of Jesus' genuine humanity. The two records cover only two of the different aspects of the Savior's wonderful status. See note 2 in Matt. 2. ",
  "1701":"The Man-Savior's life began in a manger in the lowest estate because the inn was occupied by fallen mankind with his busy activities. ",
  "1702":"Their work in shepherding the flock (which provided not only food for man but also offerings to God) and their diligence in keeping the night watches qualified them to be the first to receive the good news of the wonderful birth of the Savior, which was announced by the angel. ",
  "1703":"A baby in a manger, signifying smallness in lowliness, was a sign of the Man-Savior's life. ",
  "1704":"This little baby is called \"the mighty God\" in the prophecy concerning the Man-Savior (Isa. 9:6). ",
  "1705":"The exultation of the angels, who were excited by the birth of the Savior for man's salvation (cf. 15:7), resulted in their praising God. ",
  "1706":"The coming of the Savior rendered glory to God in the heavens and brought peace to men on earth. ",
  "1707":"Men chosen by God according to His good pleasure (Eph. 1:5). ",
  "1708":"Lit., word. ",
  "1709":"So that the Man-Savior could be a proper Israelite as a proper man before God and men, whatever was required in the law was fully fulfilled in vv. 21-24 (v. 39). ",
  "1710":"This kind of sacrifice indicates the offerers' poverty (Lev. 12:8). Poverty was another characteristic of the Man-Savior's life. ",
  "1711":"Righteous mainly toward men and devout toward God. ",
  "1712":"The Man-Savior is the consolation of God's chosen people. ",
  "1713":"The Man-Savior is God's salvation given to His people. ",
  "1714":"The Man-Savior is a light to the Gentiles and the glory of Israel. ",
  "1715":"The Man-Savior was appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel, so that many of them would be stumbled by Him and many raised up by Him (Rom. 9:33). ",
  "1716":"The Man-Savior is also a sign, a token, spoken against, contradicted, and opposed by the people who take sides with His enemy, so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed. In Simeon's word the Man-Savior was revealed as the consolation of Israel, the salvation of God, a light to the Gentiles, the glory of Israel, a test to Israel, and a sign opposed. ",
  "1717":"While the Man-Savior as a sign is spoken against, the suffering also pierces the inner being of the one who brings Him forth. This is to experience His suffering in our experience of Him. ",
  "1718":"What is within man's heart is easily revealed by his attitude toward Christ. ",
  "1719":"Or, And she was a widow for eighty-four years. ",
  "1720":"Lit., serving as a priest. ",
  "1721":"The Man-Savior as the redemption of God's people. ",
  "1722":"Some MSS read, in. ",
  "1723":"The Man-Savior was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, and remained there only briefly; but He was raised in Nazareth, a despised city, which was in Galilee, a despised region. This was arranged by the sovereignty of God in order to make Him a despised person. Being despised was another characteristic of the Savior's human life. ",
  "1724":"Grew in stature (v. 52) and became strong in spirit (cf. 1:80). ",
  "1725":"The wisdom of the Savior's deity (Col. 2:2-3) was revealed in proportion to the measure of His bodily growth. So in v. 52. ",
  "1726":"As a man, even Jesus needed the grace of God for His human life. He was filled with the wisdom of His deity and needed the grace of God in His humanity. ",
  "1727":"At the age of twelve, a boy was called by the Jews \"son of the law\" and first incurred legal obligation (Alford). The number twelve signifies eternal perfection in God's administration. Hence, twelve years old indicates that what the Lord did here was altogether related to God's administration. ",
  "1728":"Ordained by God that one might be legally a male in Israel (Deut. 16:16). ",
  "1729":"Lit., painfully distressed. ",
  "1730":"Indicating that the boy Jesus was caring for the interest of God. ",

  "1733":"In His humanity He was subject to His human parents. ",
  "1734":"The Greek word denotes not only stature, as in 19:3, but also age (see note 27 in Matt. 6). ",
  "1735":"In grace before God because He was growing in the expression of God according to God's desire; in grace before men because He was growing in the divine attributes manifested in the human virtues, which were gracious to men. He was growing as a God-man before God and men. ",

  "1739":"For the rest of the verse, see notes in Mark 1:3. ",
  "1740":"Ravine, mountain, crooked places, and rough ways are figures of speech describing the condition of men's hearts toward God and toward one another, and the relationships among men (1:16-17), which needed to be dealt with to prepare the way for the Savior's coming. ",
  "1741":"I.e., fallen men. ",
  "1742":"The Savior is the salvation of God. When He comes, the salvation of God comes. To see and receive Him is to see and receive the salvation of God. ",
  "1743":"The offspring of vipers are the children of the devil (1 John 3:10). The devil is the ancient serpent (Rev. 12:9); hence, his children become serpents with the same life and nature that he has. ",

  "1753":"The Holy Spirit's conceiving of Jesus in 1:35 was essential, related to the divine being, the divine person, of Jesus. The essence of the Holy Spirit's divine element in the conception of Jesus was unchangeable and irremovable. However, the Holy Spirit's descending upon Jesus here was economical, related to the ministry, the work, of Jesus. The power of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of Jesus (4:14, 18; Matt. 12:28) could be removed from Him, depending on the need for it. It was in such an economical way that God forsook and left Jesus while He was carrying the sinners' sin in dying for them on the cross (Matt. 27:46). The Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him here, but He had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth; and while the Holy Spirit in power was descending upon Him, He was existing with the Holy Spirit in essence.

The genealogy of Luke's Gospel, the Gospel of the Man-Savior, begins from man and traces back to God (vv. 23, 38), stressing Christ's humanity to affirm His human-divine status.

Adam was created by God (Gen. 5:1-2), and God was his origin. Based on this he was considered the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God (Acts 17:28). Mankind was only created by God, not regenerated of Him. This is absolutely and intrinsically different from the believers in Christ being the sons of God. They have been born, regenerated, of God and possess God's life and nature (John 1:12-13; 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:4). ",
  "1762":"From Jesus (v. 23) back to God there are seventy-seven generations, in which are seen the history of God's creation, man's fall, God's promise, and man's salvation: of God, man was created (v. 38; Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7); in Adam, man became fallen (v. 38; Gen. 3); through Abraham, man received God's promise (v. 34; Gen. 12:1-3); and in Jesus, man is saved (v. 23; 2:10-11).

  "1767":"This must have occurred in the preadamic age. The devil's word here indicates that when God anointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age (Ezek. 28:13-14), the authority and glory of the kingdom of the earth must have been given to him. The Lord's word in John 12:31 confirms this. After he rebelled against God and became God's enemy, Satan, he was judged by God (Isa. 14:12-15), but the full execution of God's judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:7-10). Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth. He tempted the Lord Jesus by offering this authority and its glory to Him. His evil offer was rejected by God's Christ, but it will be accepted by the Antichrist, the man of lawlessness (2 Thes. 2:3-4), at the end of this age (Rev. 13:4) for the executing of Satan's evil strategy against God.

The case of Naaman in the next verse is a case of cleansing, signifying the Lord's cleansing of sinners (1 Cor. 6:11). The Savior's mentioning of these two cases implied that His gospel would turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:45-48; see notes 21 and 22 in Matt. 15) &#151; not because His standard of morality was unable to embrace the Jews but because of the Jews' hardhearted rejection of Him.

The entrance into the kingdom is regeneration (John 3:5), and the development of the kingdom is the believers' growth in the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3-11). The kingdom is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as a reward to be inherited (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) by the overcoming saints in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God's eternal life, which all God's redeemed will enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity &#151; Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14 (see notes 15 in Mark 1, and 3 3 26 26 in Mark 4).

  "1810":"This was the Lord's calling of Peter by means of a miracle in fishing. (See note 6 par. 2, in John 21.)

  "1871":"The forgiven woman had not only love toward the Savior but also faith in Him, which operated through love (Gal. 5:6) and issued in peace. The faith that saved her brought her to the Savior in love and resulted in her going forward in peace. Faith, love, and peace are three crucial virtues in experiencing and enjoying the Savior's salvation. Faith is brought forth by knowing the Savior in His saving power and virtue. Love comes out of this faith and brings in peace; then we follow the Savior. In following the Savior in our living, faith and love bring us peace that we may enjoy the Lord's life and grow in it. ",

",
  "1924":"The Savior's human life was one of suffering. In the inn, at His birth, there was no room in which He could lie (2:7); and in His marvelous ministry there was no place for Him to rest. Suffering was a sign of His human life (2:12). ",

This may serve to confirm our preaching of the gospel today by knocking on doors and visiting people from door to door. The Lord sent the disciples as lambs entering into the midst of wolves (v. 3). However, among the wolves there were sons of peace, that is, sheep that the Lord was concerned about (Matt. 9:36) and the harvest that He desired to reap (v. 2; Matt. 9:37-38). Because these sheep and the harvest, both of which belonged to the Lord, were scattered and mixed with the wolves, it was necessary for the Lord's disciples to go into the midst of the wolves to seek them out house by house and to reap them. It is the same today. Preaching the gospel by going out to every place to visit people in their homes is ordained by God.

Then God began to execute the sentence He had imposed on him. He has executed, and will execute, this sentence on different occasions and to different degrees, such as through the seventy disciples in this chapter, through Christ on the cross (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31), through the man-child and Michael before the great tribulation, when Satan will be cast down to the earth (Rev. 12:5, 7-10, 13), and through the angel before the millennium, when Satan will be cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit (Rev. 20:1-3). Finally, Satan will be cast into the lake of fire to suffer the punishment of eternal fire after the millennium (Rev. 20:10) for eternity. ",

He was despised and slandered as a low and mean Samaritan (John 8:48; 4:9 and note 1) by the self-exalted and self-justified Pharisees, including the one to whom He was speaking here (vv. 25, 29). Such a Man-Savior, in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey (19:10), came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaistic robbers lay in his miserable and dying condition. When He saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity and rendered him tender healing and saving care, fully meeting his urgent need (vv. 34-35). ",
  "1959":"In vv. 34-35 all the aspects of the good Samaritan's care for the dying one portray the Man-Savior in His merciful, tender, and bountiful care, in His humanity with His divinity, for a sinner condemned under law, showing to the uttermost His high standard of morality in His saving grace: (1) He bound up his wounds &#151; healing him; (2) He poured oil and wine on his wounds &#151; giving him the Holy Spirit and the divine life (Matt. 9:17 and note 1; John 2:9 and note 1); (3) He placed him on his own beast (a donkey) &#151; carrying him by lowly means in a lowly way (Zech. 9:9); (4) He brought him to an inn &#151; bringing him to the church; (5) He took care of him &#151; taking care of him through the church; (6) He paid the inn for him &#151; blessing the church on his behalf; (7) He said that he would repay at his return whatever the inn spent &#151; declaring that whatever the church spends in this age on one who is saved by the Lord will be repaid at the Savior's coming back.

  "1962":"Or, The one who dealt mercifully with him. The self-justified one was helped to know that he needed a loving neighbor (such as the good Samaritan, who was a figure of the Man-Savior) to love him, not a neighbor for him to love. The Savior intended to unveil to him through this story (1) that he was condemned to death under the law and was unable to take care of himself, much less love others, and (2) that the Man-Savior was the One who would love him and render him full salvation.

The meaning of Martha and Mary conveys the thought of rebellion, perhaps pointing to the natural life of Martha and Mary.

The parable shows the compassion and love of the Savior, who is a man and becomes the sinners' neighbor; the story of Martha and Mary unveils the desire and preference of the Lord, who is God and becomes the believers' Master. The Savior gives us His compassion and love so that we can be saved by Him; the Lord expresses His desire and preference so that we can serve Him. After receiving salvation from the Savior, we should render service to the Lord. For our salvation we need to realize the Savior's compassion and love; for our service we need to know the Lord's desire and preference. ",

Matt. 13:41). If that were to happen, they would by no means come out forever (v. 59). The word in these two verses was spoken to the crowds (v. 54) that they might repent and be saved.

  "2072":"This great dinner is different from the wedding feast in Matt. 22:2-14, which was for the reward of the kingdom. This great dinner is for God's full salvation. God, as the \"certain man,\" prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews (vv. 16-17). But because they were occupied by their riches, such as land, cattle, or a wife, they refused His invitation (vv. 18-20). Then God sent the apostles to invite the people on the streets &#151; the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because of their poverty and misery, they accepted God's invitation (vv. 21-22a). Yet God's salvation still had room for more; so He sent His slaves to go out farther, to the Gentile world, signified by the roads and hedges, to compel the Gentiles to come in and fill up the house of His salvation (vv. 22b-23; Acts 13:46-48; Rom. 11:25). ",
  "2073":"In vv. 26-33 the Lord unveiled to the crowds who went along with Him (v. 25) the cost of following Him. To receive salvation is to be saved (13:23); to follow the Lord is to enjoy Him as the blessing of God's salvation. This requires us to renounce all, even our life, and to carry our own cross (vv. 26-27, 33). ",
  "2074":"The aim of the cross is not suffering but the termination of the person. The believers in Christ have been crucified (terminated) with Him (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6). After being organically united with Him through faith, they should remain on the cross, keeping their old man under the termination of the cross (cf. Rom. 6:3; Col. 2:20-21). This is to carry their own cross. Christ first carried the cross and then was crucified (John 19:17-18). But the believers in Him are first crucified and then carry the cross that they may remain in the termination of their old man, thus experiencing and enjoying Christ as their life and life supply. ",
  "2075":"The Lord's word here and that in v. 31 indicate that to make a career of following the Lord, we must give to it all we have and all we can do; otherwise, we will be a failure, becoming the tasteless salt and being thrown out of the glorious realm into a sphere of shame (vv. 34-35). ",
  "2076":"For vv. 34-35, see notes in Matt. 5:13 and note 50 in Mark 9. ",
  "2077":"The believers in Christ are the salt of the earth used by God to kill and eliminate the earth's corruption. Their taste depends on their renouncing of earthly things. The more they renounce the things of earth, the more powerful will be their taste. They will lose their taste by not being willing to renounce all the things of the present life. If this happens, they will be fit neither for the land, signifying the church as God's farm (1 Cor. 3:9), which issues in the coming kingdom (Rev. 11:15), nor for the manure pile, signifying hell, the filthy place in the universe (Rev. 21:8; 22:15). They will be thrown out from the kingdom of God, especially from the glory of the kingdom in the millennium (see note 12 in Matt. 8). They are saved from eternal perdition, but because they have failed to renounce the earthly things, they lose their function in the kingdom of God, thus being unfit for the coming kingdom and needing to be put aside for discipline (see note 32 in ch. 17). ",
  "2078":"In answering the self-righteous Pharisees and scribes, who condemned Him for eating with sinners, the Savior spoke three parables, unveiling and depicting how the Divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son by the Spirit, to the Father. The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring him back home (vv. 4-7). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman carefully seeks a lost coin until she finds it (vv. 8-10). And the Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as the \"certain man\" here receives his prodigal son (vv. 11-32). The entire Divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God. All three parables stress the love of the Divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son's tender care as the good shepherd, in the Spirit's fine seeking as the treasure-lover, and in the Father's warm receiving as a loving father. ",
  "2079":"Signifying the world. This indicates that the Son has come to the world to be with men (John 1:14). ",

  "2082":"Signifying the word of God (Psa. 119:105, 130), which is used by the Spirit to illuminate and expose the sinner's position and condition that he may repent. ",
  "2083":"To search and cleanse the sinner's inward parts. ",
  "2084":"In v. 4 the Son's finding took place outside the sinner and was completed at the cross through His redemptive death; here the Spirit's seeking is inward and is carried out by His working within the repenting sinner. ",
  "2085":"Referring to the inheritance that was his by birth. ",
  "2086":"His living refers to the father's means of support, the father's livelihood, substance (v. 30). The Greek word for living means life, i.e., the present state of existence, as in 8:14, and, by implication, livelihood, as here and in Mark 12:44. ",
  "2087":"Signifying the satanic world. ",
  "2088":"Lit., unsavingly; indicating a debauched, profligate living. ",
  "2089":"Hogs are unclean (Lev. 11:7). Feeding hogs is a dirty job; it signifies the unclean business in the satanic world. ",
  "2090":"The carob is an evergreen tree. Its pod, also called the carob bean, was used as fodder to feed animals and destitute persons. An interesting rabbinical saying is that \"when the Israelites are reduced to carob pods, then they repent.\" A tradition says that John the Baptist fed on carob pods in the wilderness; hence, they are called \"St. John's bread.\" ",
  "2091":"This was due to the enlightening and searching of the Spirit (v. 8) within him. ",
  "2092":"This is the result of the Spirit's seeking in v. 8. ",
  "2093":"The Lord's parable here implies that when a sinner sins, he sins against heaven and before God the Father, who is in heaven. ",
  "2094":"The prodigal son did not know the father's love. ",
  "2095":"Once he has repented, a fallen sinner always thinks of working for God or of serving God to obtain His favor, not knowing that this thought is against God's love and grace and is an insult to His heart and intent. ",
  "2096":"This did not happen by chance; the father went out of the house to look for the prodigal's return. ",
  "2097":"God the Father ran to receive the returning sinner. What eagerness this shows! ",
  "2098":"A warm and loving reception. The prodigal son's return to the Father was due to the Spirit's seeking (v. 8); the Father's receiving of the returned son was based on the Son's finding in His redemption (v. 4). ",
  "2099":"\"But\"! What a word of love and grace! It countered the prodigal's own thinking and stopped his nonsensical talk. ",
  "2100":"To match the father's running (v. 20). ",
  "2101":"The indicates a particular robe prepared for this particular purpose at this particular time. ",
  "2102":"Lit., first. ",
  "2103":"Signifying Christ the Son as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; cf. Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4). The best robe, which was also the first robe, replaced the rags (Isa. 64:6) of the returned prodigal. ",
  "2104":"Signifying the sealing Spirit as the God-given seal upon the accepted believer (Eph. 1:13; cf. Gen. 24:47; 41:42). ",
  "2105":"Signifying the power of God's salvation to separate the believers from the dirty earth. Both the ring and the sandals were signs of a free man. The adornment, consisting of the robe on the body, the ring on the hand, and the sandals on the feet, allowed the poor prodigal to match his rich father and qualified him to enter the father's house and feast with the father. God's salvation adorns us with Christ and the Spirit that we may enjoy the riches in His house. ",
  "2106":"Signifying the rich Christ (Eph. 3:8), killed on the cross for the believer's enjoyment. God's salvation has two aspects: the outward, objective aspect, signified by the best robe, and the inward, subjective aspect, signified by the fattened calf. Christ as our righteousness is our salvation outwardly; Christ as our life for our enjoyment is our salvation inwardly. The best robe enabled the prodigal son to meet his father's requirements and satisfy his father, and the fattened calf satisfied the son's hunger. Hence, the father and the son could be merry together. ",

  "2124":"To use money to do things to help others according to God's leading. ",
  "2125":"Mammon, i.e., money, is of the satanic world. It is unrighteous in its position and existence. The steward in the parable exercised his prudence by his unrighteous act. The Lord teaches us, His believers, to exercise our prudence in the use of unrighteous mammon. ",
  "2126":"After the satanic world is over, mammon will be of no use in the kingdom of God. ",
  "2127":"I.e., eternal habitations. The prudent believers will be received into the eternal habitations by those who shared the benefit of their prudence. This will be fulfilled in the coming kingdom age (cf. 14:13-14; Matt. 10:42). ",
  "2128":"Least refers to mammon, the possessions of this age; much refers to the rich possessions in the next age (cf. Matt. 25:21, 23). ",
  "2129":"Referring to the true possessions in the coming kingdom age (cf. Matt. 24:47). ",
  "2130":"In His New Testament economy God does not intend that the New Testament believers care for material possessions. Though the material things of this world were created by God and belong to Him (1 Chron. 29:14, 16), they have been corrupted by man's fall (Rom. 8:20-21) and usurped by Satan, the evil one (1 John 5:19); hence, they belong to fallen man and are unrighteous (v. 9). While God does supply the believers with their daily necessities from the material things of this age (Matt. 6:31-33) and commits to them as His stewards a portion of these material goods for their exercise and learning that He might prove them in this age, none of these goods should be considered theirs until the restitution of all things in the next age (Acts 3:21). Not until then will the believers inherit the world (Rom. 4:13) and have an abiding possession (Heb. 10:34) for themselves. In this age they should exercise to be faithful in the temporary material things God has given them that they may learn to be faithful toward their eternal possession in the coming age. ",
  "2131":"Some MSS read, our own. ",
  "2132":"Lit., Serve as a slave. ",
  "2133":"In Greek, hold to one means cleave to the one as against the other. This indicates that to serve the Lord requires us to love Him, giving our heart to Him, and cleave to Him, giving our entire being to Him. Thus we are released from being occupied and usurped by mammon, that we may serve the Lord wholly and fully. The Lord emphasizes here that to serve Him we must overcome the enticing, deceitful mammon of unrighteousness. ",
  "2134":"See note 24 in Matt. 6. ",
  "2135":"Lit., were turning up the nose. ",
  "2136":"The self-justifying of the Pharisees was a prideful exalting of self; hence, it was an abomination in the sight of God. ",

  "2139":"See note 43 in ch. 4. ",
  "2140":"To the Pharisees, the money lovers, the Savior preached the kingdom of God as the gospel (v. 14). Money and sexual lust, which is incited by money, held them back from entering into the kingdom of God. Hence, the Savior's preaching hit these two things purposely and strongly in vv. 18-31. ",
  "2141":"For the Pharisees to force their way into the kingdom of God, they needed to humble themselves (cf. v. 15) and to divorce their money (cf. v. 14), not their wives (cf. v. 18), that is, to overcome money and lust, which is incited by money. ",
  "2142":"The minute, horn-like projection that distinguishes various Hebrew letters. ",
  "2143":"Or, fall. ",
  "2144":"Lit., releases. ",
  "2145":"This is not a parable, because it mentions names such as Abraham, Lazarus, and Hades. It is a story used by the Savior as an illustrative answer to the money-loving and self-justifying Pharisees (vv. 14-15); it is a warning to them, unveiling that their future will be miserable, like that of the rich man, as a result of their rejecting of the Savior's gospel because of their love for money. ",
  "2146":"A rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise. See note 4 in 2 Cor. 12. ",
  "2147":"See note 23 in Matt. 11. ",
  "2148":"A gulf that divides Hades into two sections: the pleasant section, where Abraham, Lazarus, and all the saved saints are (v. 22), and the section of torment, where the rich man and all the perished sinners are (vv. 23a, 28). The two sections are cut off from each other and have no bridge between them for passage. Yet those in the two sections can see and even talk to one another (vv. 23-25). ",
  "2149":"Referring to the law of Moses and the books of the prophets (cf. v. 16), which are the word of God (Matt. 4:4). Whether one hears the word of God or not determines whether one is saved or perishes. The poor man was saved not because he was poor but because he heard the word of God (John 5:24; Eph. 1:13). The rich man perished not because he was rich but because he rejected the word of God (Acts 13:46). ",
  "2150":"If people do not hear what the word of God says, they will not be persuaded even if someone miraculously rises from the dead. The Savior's word here implied that if the Jews, represented by the Pharisees, did not hear the word of God spoken through Moses and the prophets in the Old Testament, they would not be persuaded even though He would rise from the dead. This very tragedy occurred after His resurrection (Matt. 28:11-15; Acts 13:30-40, 44-45). ",
  "2151":"Or, Add to us faith. ",

  "2156":"Indicating that the kingdom of God is not material but spiritual. It is the Savior in His first coming (vv. 21-22), in His second coming (vv. 23-30), in the rapture of His overcoming believers (vv. 31-36), and in His destroying of the Antichrist (v. 37) to recover the whole earth for His reign there (Rev. 11:15). ",
  "2157":"Verses 22-24 prove that the kingdom of God is the Savior Himself, who was among the Pharisees when He was questioned by them. Wherever the Savior is, there the kingdom of God is. The kingdom of God is with Him, and He brings it to His disciples (v. 22). He is the seed of the kingdom of God to be sown into God's chosen people to develop into God's ruling realm (see note 43 in ch. 4). Since His resurrection He has been within His believers (John 14:20; Rom. 8:10). Hence, the kingdom of God is within the church today (Rom. 14:17). ",
  "2158":"Referring to the questioning Pharisees (v. 20). The Savior as the kingdom of God was not within them but only in the midst of them. ",
  "2159":"This indicates the Savior's absence. During His absence, the world, having rejected Him, will be an evil generation, living in the indulgence of lust (vv. 23-30), and an opponent of His followers, persecuting them because of their testimony concerning Him (18:1-8). Hence, His followers need to overcome the stupefying effect of the world's indulgent living by losing their soul-life in this age (vv. 31-33). Also, they need to deal with the world's persecution by being long-suffering and praying persistently in faith (18:7-8), that they may be raptured as overcomers and enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom of God at the Savior's coming back (vv. 34-37). ",

  "2161":"Lit., under. ",
  "2162":"For vv. 26-27, see notes in Matt. 24:37-39. ",
  "2163":"The conditions of evil living that stupefied the generation of Noah before the deluge and the generation of Lot before the destruction of Sodom portray the perilous condition of man's living before the Lord's parousia (presence, coming) and the great tribulation (Matt. 24:3, 21). To participate in the overcomers' rapture that we may enjoy the Lord's parousia and escape the great tribulation, we must overcome the stupefying effect of man's living today. ",
  "2164":"To linger in the earthly and material things will cause us to miss the overcomers' rapture revealed in vv. 34-36. ",
  "2165":"Lot's wife became a pillar of salt because she took a lingering look backward at Sodom, indicating that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was going to judge and utterly destroy. She was rescued from Sodom, but she did not reach the safe place that Lot reached (Gen. 19:15-30). She did not perish; neither was she fully saved. Like the salt that becomes tasteless (14:34-35 and note 34) she was left in a place of shame. This is a solemn warning to the world-loving believers. ",
  "2166":"See note 39 in Matt. 10. Preserving our soul-life is related to lingering in the earthly and material things, as mentioned in v. 31. We linger in the earthly things because we care for our soul's enjoyment in this age. This will cause us to lose our soul; that is, our soul will suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. ",
  "2167":"For vv. 34-36, see notes in Matt. 24:40-41. In these verses the rapture of the overcoming believers is revealed. It will occur secretly and unexpectedly, at night for certain believers who are sleeping, and in the daytime for certain sisters grinding at home and certain brothers working in the field. They are chosen because they have overcome the stupefying effect of the age. In 14:25-35 the Savior charges us to pay the price, insofar as we are able, that we may follow Him. In 16:1-13 He charges us to overcome mammon that we may serve Him prudently as faithful stewards. In vv. 22-37 of this chapter, He charges us to overcome the stupefying effect of self-indulgent living in this age that we may be raptured into the enjoyment of His parousia (presence, coming). All these charges are related to the believers' overcoming in their practical living. ",
  "2168":"This is the rapture of the overcomers (see note 36 in ch. 21), who do not preserve their soul-life by loving the worldly things of this age (vv. 26-32). ",
  "2169":"Some MSS omit this verse. ",

  "2172":"Or, procure justice for. ",
  "2173":"We believers in Christ have an opponent, Satan the devil, concerning whom we need God's avenging. We ought to pray persistently for this avenging (cf. Rev. 6:9-10) and should not lose heart. ",
  "2174":"God's avenging us of our enemy will take place at the Savior's coming back (2 Thes. 2:6-9). ",
  "2175":"The persistent faith for our persistent prayer, like the faith of the widow. Hence, it is the subjective faith, not the objective faith. ",
  "2176":"What is covered in vv. 9-30 may be considered the conditions and requirements for entering into the kingdom of God: (1) to humble oneself as a sinner before God, realizing the need of God's propitiation (vv. 9-14); (2) to be like a little child, without any preoccupying concept (vv. 15-17); and (3) to follow the Savior by overcoming being occupied by riches and all other material matters (vv. 18-30). ",
  "2177":"This does not sound like a prayer but like an accusing of others. ",
  "2178":"This does not sound like a prayer but like an arrogant boast to God. Such boasting is an utterly detestable sin. ",
  "2179":"The same Greek word as for Sabbath in Matt. 28:1 and for week in John 20:1. This seven-day week is the week of the Sabbath established by the Jews according to Gen. 2. ",
  "2180":"The tax collector realized how his sinfulness offended God; hence, he asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiatory sacrifice for sins, that God might be merciful and gracious to him (see notes 25 in Rom. 3, 17 in Heb. 2, and 2 in 1 John 2). ",

  "2190":"See notes 18 in Matt. 20 and 33 in Mark 10. ",
  "2191":"This means that the Savior healed the blind man before He entered Jericho. But according to Matt. 20:29 and Mark 10:46, the healing occurred at His going out from Jericho. Luke's narrative has a spiritual significance. The blind man's receiving of sight was followed in 19:1-9 by the salvation of Zaccheus. This indicates that to receive salvation one must first have sight to see the Savior. These two cases, occurring at Jericho one after the other, should be considered, spiritually, as one complete case. A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight that he may realize that he needs salvation (Acts 26:18). <br><br>   What is covered in 18:35--19:10 shows how one can fulfill the conditions revealed in vv. 9-30 for entering the kingdom of God &#151; first, one must receive sight from the Savior (vv. 35-43), and then one must receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation (19:1-10). In this way the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child and receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches and follow Him. The way to enter into all spiritual things is to receive sight from the Lord and to receive the Lord Himself. ",

  "2198":"Once a sinner receives the Savior, the issue of his dynamic salvation is that he deals with material possessions and clears his past sinful life. ",
  "2199":"The same Greek word as in 3:14. It is a mild way of saying \"extorted.\" The tax collectors would put an excessive value on property or income, or increase the tax of those unable to pay, and would then practice usury. ",
  "2200":"This was according to the law's requirements for restoration (Exo. 22:1; 2 Sam. 12:6). ",
  "2201":"However evil this tax collector was, he nevertheless was a son of Abraham, a chosen heir of God's promised inheritance (Gal. 3:7, 29). ",
  "2202":"This indicates that the Savior's coming to Jericho was not accidental but purposeful; He came to seek this unique lost sinner, just as He sought the sinful woman in Samaria (John 4:4). ",
  "2203":"Spiritually, this further parable is a continuation of the preceding case of salvation. It depicts how the saved ones should serve the Lord that they may inherit the coming kingdom. ",

  "2208":"In the parable in Matt. 25:14-30, the slaves are given a varying number of talents according to their individual ability; here the parable emphasizes the common portion given equally to each slave based on the common salvation. However, the point of both parables is the same: the faithfulness of the slaves will determine their portion as their reward in the coming kingdom. ",

  "2226":"The Savior's first coming, when He visited them in grace in the acceptable year of the Lord (2:10-14; 4:18-22). To miss the Lord's visitation of grace and thereby lose the opportunity to repent and be saved will cause a person to be judged and to regret forever. ",

  "2236":"The faultfinding opposers' insidious questions exposed their evil, subtlety, and meanness, which were the exact opposites of the Man-Savior's perfection, wisdom, and dignity. This vindicated Him in His human perfection with His divine splendor and muzzled them in their hateful plot and their Satan-instigated conspiracy (see note 46 in Matt. 22). They were trying to find fault with the Man-Savior, but eventually they were subdued by Him, the perfect and blameless One. ",

  "2346":"Forgiveness of sins could be proclaimed only after the Man-Savior's vicarious death for the sinners' sins had been accomplished and had been verified by His resurrection (v. 46; cf. Rom. 4:25). The Gospel of John, as the Gospel of the God-Savior, emphasizes life for fruit-bearing (John 15:5). The Gospel of Luke, as the Gospel of the Man-Savior, stresses forgiveness of sins for proclaiming. To bear fruit in life requires the Spirit of life essentially, received through the breathing of the Spirit (John 20:22). To proclaim forgiveness of sins requires the Spirit of power economically, received through the baptism in the Spirit (Acts 1:5, 8). To bear fruit is a matter of life; to proclaim forgiveness of sins is a matter of power. ",
  "2347":"The promise given in Joel 2:28-29, fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:4-5, 8; 2:1-4, 16-18). It concerned the outpouring of the Spirit as the power from on high for the believers' ministry economically. This is different from the Spirit of life being breathed into the disciples (John 20:22 and note 1, par. 1) by the resurrected Savior on the day of His resurrection for His indwelling that He might be life to them essentially.

The former, like the water of life, requires our drinking (John 7:37-39); the latter, like the water of baptism, requires our being immersed (Acts 1:5). These are the two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience (1 Cor. 12:13). The indwelling of the Spirit of life is essential and is for our life and living; the outpouring of the Spirit of power is economical and is for our ministry and work. ",
  "2350":"At the Mount of Olives (Acts 1:12). ",
  "2351":"In this book Luke displays and presents mainly five crucial and excellent aspects concerning the Man-Savior: His birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension. <br><br>   (1) His birth was of and with the Spirit of God essentially, making Him a God-man so that He could be the Man-Savior (1:35). <br><br>   (2) His ministry was by and through the Spirit of God economically for the carrying out of God's economy in His jubilee (4:18-19). <br><br>   (3) His death was by His being the God-man to accomplish God's redemption for man (23:42-43) and to release Himself into man as the fire of life to burn on the earth (12:49-50). <br><br>   (4) His resurrection was (a) God's vindication of Him and of His work; (b) His success in all His achievements; and (c) His victory over the universal enemy of God. <br><br>   (5) His ascension was God's exaltation of Him, which made Him the Christ of God and the Lord of all (Acts 2:36) that He might carry out His heavenly ministry on the earth as the all-inclusive Spirit poured out from the heavens upon His Body, which is constituted of His believers (Acts 2:4, 17-18), as recorded by Luke in his further writing, the Acts. ",
  "2352":"Some MSS add, Amen. ",
  "2353":"In the beginning means in eternity past. As the introduction to this Gospel, this chapter begins in eternity past with God, who had divinity but not humanity (v. 1); it then passes through His creation of all things (v. 3), His incarnation (v. 14), His becoming the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (v. 29), and His being the Spirit who causes the believers to be transformed into living stones for His building (vv. 32, 42), and continues all the way to eternity future, in which the Son of Man, who has both divinity and humanity, is the center for the communication between heaven and earth and for the union of God and man in eternity. After this, ch. 2 shows that the principle of the Triune God as life is to change death into life (2:1-11) and that the purpose of life is to build the house, the temple, of God (2:13-22). In chs. 3--11, nine cases are given to illustrate how God as life meets the different needs of different kinds of people. As a result, in the beginning of ch. 12 a miniature of the church is produced (12:1-11). From 12:12 to the end of ch. 17 an explanation is given concerning how the church is produced through the multiplication and increase of the incarnated God-man by means of His death and resurrection. Chapters 18--20 show the accomplishing of the multiplication and increase, which causes Him to have many brothers (20:17) and enables Him to enter into them (20:22) to be their life and everything that they may be constituted His Body as His increase and expression. Finally, ch. 21 reveals that He will be with them in an invisible way until His coming back (21:22). ",
  "2354":"The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed. ",
  "2355":"The Word is not separate from God. It is not that the Word is the Word and God is God, and that they are thus separate from each other. Rather, the two are one; hence, the next clause says that the Word was God. ",
  "2356":"That the Word is God implies that God in His person is not simple; He is triune. ",
  "2357":"Not God the Son only, but the complete Triune God. ",
  "2358":"Or, This One. ",
  "2359":"In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God. Contrary to what is supposed by some, it is not that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God. Christ's deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God and He is God. This is why this Gospel, unlike Matthew (ch. 1) and Luke (ch. 3), has no genealogy of Christ (Heb. 7:3). ",
  "2360":"Since v. 3 refers to the creation in Gen. 1, life here should refer to the life signified by the tree of life in Gen. 2. This is confirmed by the fact that in Rev. 22 John mentions the tree of life. Since life is in Him, He is life (11:25; 14:6), and He came that man might have life (10:10b). The introduction to this Gospel is composed of this entire chapter; it begins with life (v. 4) and ends with building (vv. 42, 51), that is, with the house of God (see notes 42 51 and 51). Hence, it is an introduction to life and building. ",
  "2361":"The light for the old creation was physical light (Gen. 1:3-5, 14-18). The light for the new creation is the light of life mentioned here. ",

  "2365":"For human beings to become children of God is for man to have the divine life and the divine nature. ",

  "2367":"Blood (lit., bloods) here signifies the physical life; will of the flesh denotes the will of fallen man after man became flesh; and will of man refers to the will of the man created by God. ",
  "2368":"For the Word as God to become flesh is for God to have the human life and the human nature. ",
  "2369":"Romans 8:3 indicates that although this flesh was the flesh of sin, it had only the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh. It is the Word who became such flesh, and this Word was God, the complete Triune God (v. 1). That the Word became flesh means that the Triune God became a man of flesh in the likeness of a sinful man. By so doing God entered into sinful man and became one with sinful man. However, He had only the likeness of a sinful man and not the sin of a sinful man. Hence, He was a sinless God-man, the complete God and the perfect man, having two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Although His two natures were mingled to produce a God-man, the individual characteristics of the two natures remained distinct; the two natures did not intermix to form a third nature. Rather, the divine nature existed in the human nature and was expressed through the human nature, full of grace, which is God enjoyed by man, and reality, which is God obtained by man. In this way the invisible God was expressed so that men can obtain and enjoy Him as their life for the fulfillment of His New Testament economy. <br><br>   God's becoming flesh was contrary to the teaching of the Gnostics of that time. The Gnostics maintained that since the flesh is an evil substance, God, who is pure, could never be united with the evil flesh. Using the teaching of the Gnostics as a basis, the Docetists denied that Christ had come in the flesh (1 John 4:2). John wrote this Gospel in part to refute the heresy of the Docetists and to prove strongly that Christ, the God-man, is indeed God who became flesh (having only the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sin of the flesh) that through this flesh, on the one hand, He might destroy the devil (Heb. 2:14) and put away the sins of man (Heb. 9:26), and, on the other hand, God might be united with man and be expressed through humanity for the fulfillment of His glorious purpose, a purpose He planned in eternity past for eternity future. <br><br>   The deep thought of the Gospel of John is that Christ, the incarnate God, came as the embodiment of God, as illustrated by the tabernacle (v. 14) and the temple (2:21), so that man could contact Him and enter into Him to enjoy the riches contained in God. Both the tabernacle and the temple had an outer court, a Holy Place, and a Holy of Holies. Therefore, John points out first that Christ was the Lamb (who took away sin &#151; v. 29) offered on the altar, which signifies the cross, in the outer court of the tabernacle, and then that He was like the bronze serpent (which caused man to have life) lifted up on the pole (3:14), which signifies the cross. This shows how Christ in His redemption was received by His believers that they might be delivered from sin and obtain life and might enter into Him as the embodiment of God, typified by the tabernacle, to enjoy all the riches that are in God. The foot-washing in ch. 13 may be considered the washing in the laver in the outer court of the tabernacle, which washed away the earthly defilement of those who drew near to God, so that their fellowship with God and with one another could be maintained. In ch. 14 those who receive Christ are brought by Him into the Holy Place to experience Him as the bread of life (6:35), signified by the showbread, and as the light of life (8:12; 9:5), signified by the lampstand. Eventually, in ch. 17, through the highest and most mysterious prayer, which is typified by the burning incense on the golden incense altar, those who enjoy Christ as life and as light are brought by Him into the Holy of Holies to enter with Him into the deepest enjoyment of God and to enjoy the glory that God has given Him (17:22-24). ",
  "2370":"The Word, by being incarnated, not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God's habitation on earth among men. ",
  "2371":"This refers to Christ's transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:1-2, 5; Luke 9:32; 2 Pet. 1:16-18). ",

  "2373":"Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. The Greek word for reality is the same as that for truth in 5:33; 8:32; and 17:17, 19. ",
  "2374":"Lit., out of. ",
  "2375":"The law makes demands on man according to what God is; grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands. The law, at most, was only a testimony of what God is (Exo. 25:21), but reality is the realization of what God is. No man can partake of God through the law, but grace enables man to enjoy God. Reality is God realized by man, and grace is God enjoyed by man. ",

But Jesus was introduced to them as a little lamb with a little dove (vv. 29-33). The Lamb takes sin away from man, and the dove brings God as life to man. The Lamb is for redemption, to redeem fallen man back to God, and the dove is for life-giving, for anointing, to anoint man with what God is, to bring God into man and man into God, and for uniting the believers in God. Both the Lamb and the dove are needed for man to participate in God. ",

It must have been from this that Peter obtained the concept of living stones for the building of a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5), which is the church. The stone here denotes a work of transformation that brings forth material for God's building (1 Cor. 3:12). ",
  "2387":"The information that Philip passed on to Nathanael in the words son of Joseph and from Nazareth was inaccurate. Jesus was born not of Joseph but of Mary (Matt. 1:16), and not in Nazareth but in Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7). ",

Christ as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and leading to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel. Jacob poured oil (a symbol of the Holy Spirit, the ultimate expression of the Triune God reaching man) upon the stone (a symbol of the transformed man) that it might be the house of God. Here in this chapter are the Spirit (v. 32) and the stone (v. 42) for the house of God with Christ in His humanity. Where this is, there is an open heaven. ",
  "2391":"This chapter, as the introduction to this Gospel, introduces Christ as both the Son of God (vv. 34, 49) and the Son of Man. Nathanael recognized Him as the Son of God and addressed Him as such (v. 49), but Christ said to Nathanael that He was the Son of Man. The Son of God is God; as such, He has the divine nature. The Son of Man is man; as such, He possesses the human nature. For the declaring of God (v. 18) and for the bringing of God to man, He is the only begotten Son of God. But for the building of God's habitation on earth among men, He is the Son of Man. God's building needs His humanity. In eternity past Christ was only God, only the Son of God, and had only divinity; but in eternity future Christ, as God and man and as the Son of God and the Son of Man, will have both divinity and humanity forever.

There the people believed into the Lord because they saw the miracles He performed. The Lord could not commit Himself to such people. But the case in this chapter concerns life in regeneration; it reveals that this book is not for miraculous things but is only for life. This is why in this book even the miracles done by the Lord are called signs, signifying that the Lord came for life so that God might be multiplied (12:24), not for miracles so that man might be benefited. ",
  "2415":"Nicodemus considered Christ a teacher who had come from God. This indicates that he might have thought that he needed better teachings so that he could improve himself. But the Lord's answer in the next verse unveiled to him that his need was to be born anew. To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life different from the human life received by natural birth. Hence, his real need was not better teachings by which he could improve himself, but the divine life by which he could be remade. He was seeking for teachings, which belong to the tree of knowledge, but the Lord's answer turned him to his need for life, which belongs to the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9, 17). ",

  "2420":"The words of water and the Spirit should have been plain to Nicodemus, without any need of explanation. In Matt. 3:11 John the Baptist spoke the same words to the Pharisees; hence, they should have been fully understood among the Pharisees. Now Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, was conversing with the Lord, and the Lord spoke these familiar words. \"Water\" was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation. \"Spirit\" is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. These two main concepts together constitute the concept of regeneration. Regeneration is the termination of people of the old creation with all their deeds, and the germination of people in the new creation with the divine life. ",

  "2426":"Things on earth here does not mean things of an earthly nature but things that take place on earth, including redemption and regeneration. In the same principle things in heaven in this verse does not mean things of a heavenly nature but things that take place in heaven. In the next verse the Lord said that He was the One who descended out of heaven and who was still in heaven. This indicates that He knew the things that took place in heaven, because He was the One who was in heaven all the time. ",
  "2427":"Some ancient MSS omit, who is in heaven. ",
  "2428":"This chapter deals with regeneration. Regeneration, on one hand, brings the divine life with the divine nature into us. On the other hand, regeneration terminates the evil nature of Satan in our flesh. In Gen. 3 Satan, the serpent, injected his nature into man's flesh. When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents (Num. 21:4-9). God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God's judgment, that by looking upon that bronze serpent all might live. That was a type. Here, in this verse, the Lord Jesus applied that type to Himself, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in \"the likeness of the flesh of sin\" (Rom. 8:3), which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison. Christ was made in \"the likeness of the flesh of sin,\" but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross, by His death Satan, the old serpent, was dealt with (12:31-33; Heb. 2:14). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with. When a man is regenerated with the divine life in Christ, his satanic nature is annulled. Because of this, in this portion of the Word, when the Lord revealed the matter of regeneration to Nicodemus, He specifically mentioned this point. <br><br>   Nicodemus might have considered himself a moral and good man. But the Lord's word in this verse implied that regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, he had the serpentine nature of Satan inwardly. As a descendant of Adam, he had been poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent's nature was within him. He needed the Lord not only to be the Lamb of God to take away his sin (1:29) but also to be in the form of the serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross and that he might have eternal life. In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this is the changing of death into life. ",
  "2429":"This is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which not only is everlasting with respect to time but also is eternal and divine in nature. So in vv. 16, 36. ",
  "2430":"The world here refers to sinful, fallen people, who constitute the world. They have not only sin but also the poisonous element of the devil, the ancient serpent; hence, they have become serpents. They need Christ to die for them in the form of a serpent and be judged by God as their Substitute (v. 14); otherwise, they will perish (v. 16). Although men are utterly fallen, God still loves them with His divine love, which is Himself (1 John 4:8, 16), because they are vessels created by God according to His own image to contain Himself (Gen. 1:26; Rom. 9:21a, 23). Moreover, He so loves them that He gave them His only begotten Son, His expression, that they might obtain His eternal life to become His many sons and be His corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal New Testament economy. Hence, God first regenerates them by His Spirit (vv. 3-6) that they may have His eternal life (vv. 15-16, 36a). Then He fills them with His unlimited Spirit (v. 34) that they may become the bride of Christ, who is above all and is all-inclusive (vv. 31-35), to be His increase and fullness (vv. 28-30). ",
  "2431":"Believing into the Lord is not the same as believing Him (6:30). To believe Him is to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him is to receive Him and be united with Him as one. The former is to acknowledge a fact objectively; the latter is to receive a life subjectively. ",
  "2432":"Or, judge. ",
  "2433":"Or, judged. ",
  "2434":"Or, judgment. ",
  "2435":"I.e., does evil habitually. The same word is used in 5:29. ",
  "2436":"Or, exposed, uncovered. ",
  "2437":"According to the context, truth here denotes uprightness (as opposed to evil &#151; vv. 19-20), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is, and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ. See note 6 in 1 John 1. ",
  "2438":"The increase in this verse is the bride in v. 29, and the bride there is a living composition of all the regenerated people. This means, in this chapter on regeneration, that regeneration not only brings the divine life into the believers and annuls the satanic nature in their flesh, but it also makes them the corporate bride for Christ's increase. The last two points, the annulling of the serpentine nature in the believers and the believers' being made the bride of Christ, are fully developed in John's Revelation. The book of Revelation reveals mainly how Satan as the old serpent will be fully eliminated (Rev. 20:2, 10) and how Christ's bride, the New Jerusalem, will be fully produced (Rev. 21:2, 10-27). ",
  "2439":"Verses 31-36 unveil to us the immeasurableness, the unlimitedness, of Christ. He is such an immeasurable and unlimited One, who comes from above, who is above all, to whom the Father has given all, and who dispenses the Spirit without measure. Such a One needs a universal increase to be His bride to match Him, as revealed in vv. 22-30. He who believes into this immeasurable One has eternal life; he who disobeys this One is under the wrath of God. ",
  "2440":"From, of, and out of are the same word in Greek. Since persons, matters, and things on the earth are from the earth, they are of the earth. He who comes from heaven refers to one who is out of heaven; therefore, such a one is of heaven. ",
  "2441":"See note 63 in ch. 6. ",
  "2442":"Lit., fountain; as in v. 14. ",
  "2443":"I.e., 6:00 p.m. ",
  "2444":"Samaria was the leading region of the northern kingdom of Israel and was the site of its capital (1 Kings 16:24, 29). Around 700 B.C., the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria (2 Kings 17:6, 24). From that time the Samaritans became a people of mixed heathen and Jewish blood. History tells us that they had the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament. But they were never recognized by the Jews as being part of the Jewish people. ",
  "2445":"This signifies the enjoyment of material things and the amusement obtained from worldly entertainment. These cannot quench the thirst deep within man. However much he drinks of this material and worldly \"water,\" he will thirst again. The more he drinks of this \"water,\" the more his thirst increases. ",
  "2446":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2447":"This word was intended to touch her conscience by referring to her history of immorality, so that she would repent of her sins. ",
  "2448":"The woman tried the first husband, drinking of that \"water,\" and she was not satisfied. Then she tried the second, third, fourth, and fifth husbands. Since none of these satisfied her, she was trying another. Her changing of husbands fully proved that however much she drank of that \"water,\" she was still thirsty. \"Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again.\" This word of the Lord's is true! ",
  "2449":"The woman's problem, like the questions in 8:3-5 and 9:2-3, was a matter of yes or no, which belongs to the tree of knowledge; but the Lord turned her to the spirit (vv. 21-24), which belongs to the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9, 17). ",
  "2450":"God here is the complete Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. ",
  "2451":"Spirit here refers to the nature of the complete Triune God; it does not refer merely to the Lord Spirit. To worship God, who is Spirit, we must worship with our spirit, which is of the same nature as He is. ",
  "2452":"This word was given to instruct the Samaritan woman regarding her need to exercise her spirit to contact God the Spirit. To contact God the Spirit with the spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God. ",
  "2453":"This is our human spirit. According to typology, God should be worshipped (1) in the place chosen by God for His habitation (Deut. 12:5, 11, 13-14, 18), and (2) with the offerings (Lev. 1--6). The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God's habitation is today (Eph. 2:22). The offerings typify Christ; Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which the people worshipped God. Hence, when the Lord instructed the woman to worship God the Spirit in spirit and truthfulness, He meant that she should contact God the Spirit in her spirit instead of in a specific location, and through Christ instead of with the offerings. Since Christ, as the reality that issues in the human virtue of truthfulness, has come (vv. 25-26), all the shadows and types are over. ",
  "2454":"According to the context of this chapter and the entire revelation of John's Gospel, truthfulness here denotes the divine reality becoming man's genuineness and sincerity (which are the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper &#151; vv. 16-18) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ (who is the reality &#151; 14:6) as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God (1:29; 3:14) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit (vv. 7-15), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks. See note 6 in 1 John 1; Rom. 3:7; and note 8 in Rom. 15. ",
  "2455":"By this word Jesus led her to believe that He was the Christ, that she might have eternal life (20:31). She believed (v. 29). ",
  "2456":"Whoever drinks the living water and is satisfied with it will drop his preoccupations and testify of it. In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this also is the changing of death into life. ",
  "2457":"This indicates that the woman believed that Jesus was the Christ. By thus believing, she received the living water and was satisfied. ",
  "2458":"The sinner was satisfied by receiving the Savior's living water, and the Savior was satisfied by doing God's will in satisfying the sinner. Doing the will of God to satisfy the sinner is the Savior's food (v. 34). ",
  "2459":"Or, for. ",
  "2460":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2461":"Others have labored should mean that some had sown the seed among the Samaritans using the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament), which the Samaritans did possess. Here the Lord sent His disciples to reap what the earlier laborers had sown. ",
  "2462":"The Lord went to Galilee to avoid gaining fame, which He had gained in Jerusalem (2:23). ",
  "2463":"See note 1 in ch. 2. ",
  "2464":"Galilee, a despised place (7:41, 52), signifies the world, which is in a low and mean condition. ",
  "2465":"The word of life out of the mouth of the Lord gives life to the dying. ",
  "2466":"I.e., 7:00 p.m. ",
  "2467":"The first sign in Cana (2:1-11) signifies the changing of death into life, setting forth the principle of life. The second sign here is a continuation, an application of the principle of the changing of death into life. The source of death is the tree of knowledge, and the source of life is the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9, 17). ",
  "2468":"The sheepgate signifies the door to the sheepfold of the religion of law keeping (10:1). ",
  "2469":"Bethesda means house of mercy, signifying that the people who practiced law keeping needed the mercy of God because they were impotent, weak, and wretched, as portrayed in Rom. 7:7-24. ",
  "2470":"Porticoes signify the shelter of the religion of law keeping, a shelter like that provided by a sheepfold. The number five signifies responsibility. ",
  "2471":"This signifies that under the shelter of law keeping, in the sheepfold of religion, there are many who are blind, unable to see; many who are lame, unable to walk; and many who are withered, lacking the life supply. ",
  "2472":"Some MSS omit this last part of v. 3 and all of v. 4. ",
  "2473":"The angel here signifies the agent through which the law, which could not give life, was given (Gal. 3:19, 21). ",
  "2474":"The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the attempt to make people perfect by the practice of law keeping. ",
  "2475":"Or, whole, sound. So in v. 6. ",
  "2476":"With this sick and impotent man there was no happiness, even on the joyful day of a feast (v. 1), and there was no rest, even on the Sabbath day (v. 10). ",
  "2477":"This sign signifies that when the practice of law keeping in the Jewish religion became an impossibility because of the impotence of man (Rom. 8:3), the Son of God came to enliven the dead (v. 25). The law could not give life (Gal. 3:21), but the Son of God gives life to the dead (v. 21). \"While we were yet weak\" (Rom. 5:6), He came to enliven us. ",
  "2478":"Or, Lord. ",
  "2479":"There was a means for healing in the religion of law keeping, but it did not profit the impotent man, because he had no strength to fulfill the law's requirements. The law keeping in religion depends on man's effort, man's doing, man's make-up. Since man is impotent, the law keeping in religion becomes ineffective. The holy city, the holy temple, the feast, the Sabbath, the angels, Moses, and the Scriptures are all good things of this religion, but they could do nothing for this impotent man. In the eyes of the Lord he was a dead person (v. 25), in need not only of healing but also of enlivening. With the Lord's enlivening there is no requirement. The impotent man heard His voice and was enlivened (v. 25). ",
  "2480":"A small mattress or pad; so in vv. 9, 10, 11, and 12. ",
  "2481":"According to vv. 24-25, this is to pass out of death into life and to live. In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this is the changing of death into life. ",
  "2482":"Formerly, the mat carried the impotent man, but now the enlivened man carried the mat. ",
  "2483":"Life's enlivening broke religion's ritual. Religion was offended by life and began its opposition to life from this point (vv. 16, 18). <br><br>   The Sabbath is for man (Mark 2:27) and should be a rest to man. Religion's law keeping did not bring rest to this man who had been sick for thirty-eight years, but life's enlivening did. Yet the religious cared only for their ritual of Sabbath keeping; they had no concern for the sick man's rest. ",
  "2484":"This indicates that the man's former sickness was due to his sin. ",
  "2485":"Some MSS omit, and sought to kill Him. ",
  "2486":"God's work in creation was finished (Gen. 2:1-3), but the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building. ",
  "2487":"On one hand, the religious people kept the Sabbath, but on the other hand, they sought to kill Jesus. How could they have had rest? Because of their religious concept, they thought that to kill those who would not keep their religious ritual was to offer service to God (16:2). This is Satan's poisoning of people with religion, causing them to murder, just as he poisons people with sin. ",
  "2488":"Actually, the Son and the Father are one (10:30). ",
  "2489":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2490":"Or, condemnation. ",
  "2491":"The source of death is the tree of knowledge, and the source of life is the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9, 17). Hence, to pass out of death into life is to change the source of one's living. ",
  "2492":"Not those who are dead physically but those who are dead in spirit, in accordance with Eph. 2:1, 5 and Col. 2:13. Hence, in this verse to live means to be alive in spirit. It does not signify resurrection of the physical body, which is mentioned in vv. 28-29. ",
  "2493":"The Lord is the Son of God (v. 25); hence, He can give life (v. 21). He is also the Son of Man; hence, He can execute judgment. ",
  "2494":"Referring to those who are dead physically and are buried in a tomb. Hence, their coming forth from the tomb in v. 29 is the resurrection of the physical body. ",
  "2495":"This is the resurrection of the saved believers, which will take place before the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16). At the Lord Jesus' coming back, the dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life. Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of life. ",
  "2496":"See note 20 in ch. 3. ",
  "2497":"This is the resurrection of the unbelievers who have perished; it will take place after the millennium (Rev. 20:5, 12). All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment. <br><br>   In this chapter vv. 24-26 speak concerning the enlivening of the spirit; vv. 28-29, concerning the resurrection of the whole being, including the body. ",
  "2498":"Or, condemnation. ",
  "2499":"The same Greek word as for reality in 1:14, 17. The preceding verse says that John testified concerning Christ; this verse says that John testified to the truth. This proves that truth here is Christ (14:6). According to the entire revelation of this Gospel, truth is the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ, the Son of God. See note 6 in 1 John 1. ",
  "2500":"See note 6 in ch. 1; so in v. 38. ",
  "2501":"This refers to the Father's testimony concerning the Lord, given at the time He was baptized (Matt. 3:17). At that time the Jews heard the Father's voice and saw the form of the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:22), although prior to that time they had neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form. ",
  "2502":"To \"search the Scriptures\" may be separated from \"come to Me\" (v. 40). The Jewish religionists searched the Scriptures but were not willing to come to the Lord. These two should go together; because the Scriptures testify concerning the Lord, they should not be separated from the Lord. We may contact the Scriptures, yet not contact the Lord. Only the Lord can give life. ",
  "2503":"See note 39. ",
  "2504":"The Son being in the name of the Father is equivalent to the Son being the Father; hence, He is called the Father (Isa. 9:6). This proves that the Son and the Father are one (10:30). See note 26 in ch. 14. ",
  "2505":"This case is in contrast to the case in ch. 5. There the person was by a pool; here the people are around a sea. The scene of the foregoing case was the holy city with a sacred pool for man's healing. The scene of this case is the wilderness with a secular sea for man's livelihood. The person in the previous case was impotent and needed life's enlivening. The people in this case are hungry and need life's feeding. In typology the land signifies the earth, which was created by God for man to live on, and the sea signifies the world, which has been corrupted by Satan and in which fallen mankind lives. In this world mankind is hungry and has no satisfaction. In this world mankind is troubled and has no peace, as portrayed in v. 18. ",
  "2506":"A mountain signifies a transcendent position above the land and the sea. To enjoy Christ's feeding, people must go with Christ to the mountain. ",
  "2507":"In the Passover, people slay the redeeming lamb, sprinkle its blood, and eat its flesh. This typifies Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7). He is the redeeming Lamb of God (1:29, 36) slain for us that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, taking Him in as our life supply that we may live by Him. ",
  "2508":"The denarius was the chief silver coin of the Romans; it was considered good pay for a day's labor (see Matt. 20:2). ",
  "2509":"The number five signifies responsibility, indicating here that Christ bears the responsibility to be our life supply. The number two signifies testimony, testifying here that Christ is our life supply. ",
  "2510":"Loaves are of the vegetable life and signify the generating aspect of Christ's life. Fish are of the animal life and signify the redeeming aspect of Christ's life. As the generating life, Christ grows in the land, the God-created earth; as the redeeming life, He lives in the sea, the Satan-corrupted world. In order to regenerate us, He grew on the God-created earth that He might reproduce; in order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world. But He is not sinful, not affected by the world, just as fish live in salt water but are not salty. <br><br>   In the Jewish land barley ripens earliest and is the first of the harvest; hence, it typifies the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:10). The barley loaves represent Christ in resurrection as food to us. <br><br>   Barley loaves and fish are small items, signifying Christ's smallness, through which He can be the life supply to us. Those who sought miracles considered Him the promised Prophet and would have forced Him to be King (vv. 14-15), but He would not seek to be a giant in religion; rather, He preferred to be small loaves and little fish that people might eat Him. ",
  "2511":"The twelve handbaskets left over signify the overflow of the riches of Christ's life supply. The five loaves, which represent this supply, not only fed one thousand times that number, that is, five thousand people, but also provided enough for something to be left over. ",
  "2512":"I.e., to make Him the Messiah. ",
  "2513":"The churning of the sea signifies the troubles in human life. ",
  "2514":"I.e., about three or four miles. ",
  "2515":"This signifies that the Lord can overrule all the troubles of human life. He can walk on the troubling waves of human life, and all the troubles are under His feet. ",
  "2516":"We need to take the Lord into our \"boat\" (our married life, our family, our business, etc.) and enjoy peace with Him on the journey of human life. ",

  "2518":"Fallen man's concept concerning God is that he must do something for God and work for God. This is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in Gen. 2. ",
  "2519":"The Lord's concept concerning God is that man should believe into Him, that is, receive Him as life and the life supply. This is the principle of the tree of life, which brings in life, as seen in Gen. 2. It is in contrast to the principle of the tree of knowledge, which brings in death. ",

  "2521":"Through incarnation. ",
  "2522":"The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food. It is like the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), which also is the life supply \"good for food.\" ",
  "2523":"In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this also is the changing of death into life. The source of death is the tree of knowledge, and the source of life is the tree of life. ",
  "2524":"See note 45 in ch. 1. ",
  "2525":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "2526":"Bread of life (v. 35) refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living. ",
  "2527":"At this point the bread becomes the flesh. Bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming. Before the fall of man, the Lord was the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), which is only for feeding man. After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb (1:29), which is not only for feeding man but also for redeeming him (Exo. 12:4, 7-8). ",
  "2528":"The Lord gave His body, that is, His flesh, dying for us that we might have life. ",
  "2529":"At this point blood is added, which is necessary for redemption (19:34; Heb. 9:22; Matt. 26:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rom. 3:25). ",
  "2530":"Lit., masticates; so in vv. 56, 57, 58. ",
  "2531":"Here flesh and blood are mentioned separately. The separation of blood and flesh indicates death. Here the Lord clearly indicated His death, that is, His being slain. He gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life. To eat His flesh is to receive by faith all that He did in giving His body for us; and to drink His blood is to receive by faith all that He accomplished in shedding His blood for us. To eat His flesh and drink His blood is to receive Him, in His redemption, as life and the life supply by believing in what He did for us on the cross. By comparing this verse with v. 47, we see that to eat the Lord's flesh and drink His blood is to believe in Him, because to believe or to believe into is to receive (1:12). ",
  "2532":"This indicates that the Lord had to be resurrected so that He could abide in us as our life and life supply. ",
  "2533":"To eat is to take food into us that it may be assimilated organically into our body. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by Him whom we have received. It is by this that He, the resurrected One, lives in us (14:19-20).",
  "2534":"In v. 56 the Lord's resurrection is implied. In this verse His ascension, which followed His resurrection, is clearly mentioned. The Lord's ascension was the proof that His redemptive work had been completed (Heb. 1:3b). ",
  "2535":"At this point the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh (1:14), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Cor. 15:45. It is as the life-giving Spirit that He can be life and the life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life into us. We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life. ",
  "2536":"Flesh here, according to the context, refers to the meat of the physical body. When the Lord said, \"The bread which I will give is My flesh\" (v. 51), the Jews thought that He would give them the meat of His physical body to eat (v. 52). They did not understand the Lord's word rightly. To them it was a hard word (v. 60). Hence, in this verse the Lord explained that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; the meat, which is the flesh, profits nothing. What He would give, eventually, was the Spirit who gives life, who is the Lord Himself in resurrection. ",
  "2537":"The Greek word for words, here and in v. 68, is rhema, which denotes the instant and present spoken word. It differs from logos (used for Word in 1:1), which denotes the constant word. Here the words follows the Spirit. The Spirit is living and real, yet He is very mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend; the words, however, are substantial. First, the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who is life. ",
  "2538":"Lit., deliver Him up; so throughout the book. ",
  "2539":"Although the Lord is God the Creator, He lived on earth as a man and suffered persecution at the hands of His creatures. ",
  "2540":"In the scene of the case in ch. 6 there was the Feast of the Passover. In the scene of this case in ch. 7 there is the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of the Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last (Lev. 23:5, 34). The Feast of the Passover, being the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man's life (cf. Exo. 12:2-3, 6), which involves man's seeking for satisfaction and results in man's hunger. The Feast of Tabernacles, being the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man's life (cf. Exo. 23:16), which will end and will result in man's thirst. In the scene of the Feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man's hunger. In the scene of the Feast of Tabernacles, the Lord promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man's thirst. <br><br>   After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped (Deut. 16:13-15). Hence, this feast signifies the completion, achievement, and success in man's career, man's study, and other matters of human life, including religion, with the joy and enjoyment thereof. <br><br>   God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents (Lev. 23:39-43), expecting to enter into the rest of the good land. Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle (Heb. 11:9-10), in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man's thirst (Rev. 22:1, 17). At the end of such a feast, which had such a background, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which will satisfy man's expectation for eternity (vv. 37-39). ",
  "2541":"Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here on earth as a man, being limited even in the matter of time. ",
  "2542":"Although He is the Almighty God, as a man under persecution the Lord was limited also in relation to His activity. ",
  "2543":"Although He is the omniscient God, as a lowly man the Lord appeared to be illiterate. ",
  "2544":"Or, countenance, face, sight. ",
  "2545":"Inward, subjective understanding. So in the next verse. ",
  "2546":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "2547":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2548":"The last day here signifies that all the enjoyment of any success in the human life will end. There is a \"last day\" to every kind of material thing of the physical life. ",
  "2549":"In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this also is the changing of death into life. The source of death is the tree of knowledge, and the source of life is the tree of life. This book shows us that life is in opposition to death (5:24-25; 8:24; 11:25-26). ",
  "2550":"The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. Rom. 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23), originating from the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God's Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). ",
  "2551":"The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but at the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). After Jesus' resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected (20:22). The Spirit is now the \"another Comforter,\" the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death (14:16-17). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, the Spirit is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive (vv. 38-39). ",
  "2552":"The Lord was born in Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) but was raised in Nazareth of Galilee, a city that was despised by people at that time. He was the seed of David, but He came as a Nazarene (Matt. 2:23). He grew up \"as a root out of a dry ground,\" having \"no form nor comeliness,\" \"no beauty that we should desire Him,\" and was \"despised and rejected of men\" (Isa. 53:2-3). Hence, we should know Him not according to the flesh (2 Cor. 5:16) but according to the Spirit. ",
  "2553":"Or, judge. ",
  "2554":"Many ancient manuscripts omit 7:53--8:11. ",
  "2555":"In this Gospel nine cases have been selected to prove that the Lord Jesus is the life and the life supply to people. The first six cases, in chs. 3--7, form a group of signs signifying that, on the positive side, the Lord is the life and the life supply to us for regenerating, satisfying, healing, enlivening, feeding, and thirst quenching. The last three cases, in chs. 8--11, form a group of signs signifying that, on the negative side, the Lord is life to us to deliver us from the three main negative things: sin, blindness, and death. <br><br>   The case in this chapter reveals all the matters related to the problem of sin: (1) the source of sin &#151; the devil; (2) the three main items of sin &#151; adultery and fornication, murder, and lies (vv. 3, 41, 44); (3) the bondage, or slavery, of sin; (4) the issue, or result, of sin &#151; death; (5) the One who is without sin &#151; the Lord; (6) the One who is qualified to condemn sin &#151; the Lord; (7) the One who is qualified to forgive sin &#151; the Lord; (8) the One who is able to set people free from sin &#151; the Lord. The Lord is the ever-existing God, the great I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross to bear our sins; hence, He is qualified to forgive our sins. Furthermore, the Lord, being the eternal God, can come into us to be life and light to deliver us from the bondage and darkness of sin. <br><br>   The case in this chapter shows also that the religion (represented by the temple &#151; vv. 2, 20) of law (vv. 5, 17) cannot set people free from sin and death; but the Lord Jesus, the I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross for the serpent-poisoned people, can do what religion and law cannot do. This chapter shows us that Christ, the great I Am, not only is versus sin and death but also is versus religion and law. ",
  "2556":"Their question here, like those in 4:20-25 and 9:2-3, was a matter of yes or no, which belongs to the tree of knowledge, the result of which is death (Gen. 2:17). But the Lord's answer in v. 7 pointed them to Himself, the One who is the tree of life, which results in life (Gen. 2:9). ",
  "2557":"The Lord Jesus' stooping down was a sign done to humble and calm the proud and self-righteous scribes and Pharisees. It might be that He was writing, \"Who among you is without sin?\" ",
  "2558":"Or, Sir. ",
  "2559":"The scribes and Pharisees could not condemn the woman, because they were all sinful. Only the Lord Jesus was without sin, and only He was qualified to condemn the woman; but He would not. ",
  "2560":"The light of life (1:4) shines within man by the inner sense of life to deliver man from sin. ",
  "2561":"Or, condemn. ",
  "2562":"This proves that when the Son was on the earth, the Father was with Him on the earth. The Father can never be separated from the Son, and the Son can never be separated from the Father. When the Son was on the earth, He was still in heaven with the Father (3:13). This proves that when God became flesh (1:14), it was the Son with the Father, the Father with the Son, in the Spirit (that is, the entire God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit) who became flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). See also v. 29. ",
  "2563":"From and of are the same word in Greek. ",
  "2564":"I am (vv. 28, 58) is the meaning of the name Jehovah (Exo. 3:14), and Jehovah is the name of God (Gen. 2:7), the One who is and who was and who is coming, the self-existing and ever-existing One (Rev. 1:4; Exo. 3:14-15). This name is used in speaking of God in His relationship with man. Hence, it indicates that the Lord is the ever-existing God who has a relationship with man. Any man who does not believe that the Lord is this very God will die in his sins. ",
  "2565":"The Lord's speaking reveals what He is, in particular His eternal divinity, as the I Am spoken of in the foregoing verse. This is the basic element revealed in the Lord's word. ",
  "2566":"The phrase lift (or lifted ) up is used also in 3:14 and 12:31-34. In 3:14 the Lord as the Son of Man was to be lifted up in the form of the serpent to bear the judgment of God for the serpent-poisoned people. In 12:31-34 the Lord as the Son of Man was to be lifted up for the casting out of the old serpent, Satan, the ruler of the world. Hence, in this chapter the Lord, as the Son of Man lifted up, can deliver the serpent-poisoned people from sin, the serpent's poison. ",
  "2567":"In Greek the same as reality in 1:14, 17. The truth is not the so-called truth of doctrine but the reality of the divine things, which is the Lord Himself (see note 6 in ch. 14; 1:14, 17). This verse says that \"the truth shall set you free,\" whereas v. 36 says that \"the Son sets you free.\" This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the truth. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the very divine element of God realized by us. When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, bringing the divine element as reality into us. This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man. When the Lord as the Word of God became flesh (1:14), He brought God to us as this reality, that God might be the grace for our enjoyment (1:17). ",
  "2568":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2569":"Because the devil is the father of sinners, sinners are the children of the devil (1 John 3:10). The devil is the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), and sinners also are serpents, the generation of vipers (Matt. 23:33; 3:7). Hence, they need the Lord in the form of the serpent to be lifted up for them on the cross (3:14) to save them not only from sin but also from the source of sin, the devil (Heb. 2:14). ",
  "2570":"The Lord's word here revealed that in the devil, the father of lies, there is a particular wicked thing that caused him to become the source of sin. This thing is something of his own, his private possession, and it is something that other creatures do not have. ",
  "2571":"Or, father of lies. Since the devil is the father of liars, he is the source of sin. The divine element of God, working as life and light within man, sets man free from the slavery of sin. But the evil element of the devil, working as sin through death and darkness within man, enslaves man to sin. The devil's nature is a lie and brings in death and darkness. With darkness is falsehood, the opposite of the truth. ",
  "2572":"See note 63 in ch. 6. ",
  "2573":"In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this also is the changing of death into life. ",
  "2574":"In this verse two Greek words are used for know: the first denotes the outward, objective knowledge; the second refers to the inward, subjective consciousness. The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees that they had not known God the Father, even in the outward, objective knowledge, but that He knew the Father in the inward, subjective consciousness. ",
  "2575":"The Lord as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God. Hence, He was before Abraham and is greater than Abraham (v. 53). ",
  "2576":"This case is further proof that the religion of law (see note 14) could not in any way help a blind man. But the Lord Jesus, as the light of the world, imparted sight to him in the way of life (10:10b, 28). ",
  "2577":"Blindness, like sin in the previous chapter, is a matter of death. A dead person surely is blind. \"The god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers.\" Hence, they need \"the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ\" to shine on them (2 Cor. 4:4) \"to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God\" (Acts 26:18). In the principle set forth in ch. 2, this also is the changing of death into life. ",
  "2578":"This question, like those in 4:20-25 and 8:3-5, was a matter of yes or no, which belongs to the tree of knowledge, the result of which is death (Gen. 2:17). But the Lord's answer in v. 3 pointed them to Himself, the One who is the tree of life, which results in life (Gen. 2:9). ",
  "2579":"Clay here, as in Rom. 9:21, signifies humanity. Spittle here, as something that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord (Matt. 4:4), signifies the Lord's words, which are Spirit and are life (6:63). The Lord's making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord's living word, which is the Spirit. The word anointed proves this, because the Lord's Spirit is the anointing Spirit (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27). Here the Lord anointed the blind eyes with the clay made of His spittle, that they might have sight. This signifies that by the anointing of the mingling of the Lord's word (which is His Spirit) with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, can have sight. ",
  "2580":"Here to wash is to cleanse away the clay. This signifies the washing away of our old humanity, as experienced in baptism (Rom. 6:3-4, 6). ",
  "2581":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2582":"His going and washing indicates that he obeyed the life-giving word of the Lord. So he received sight. If he had not gone to wash off the clay after having been anointed with it, the clay would have blinded him even more. Our obedience to the Lord's anointing cleanses us and brings us sight. ",
  "2583":"It seems that the Lord again purposely did a sign on the Sabbath to expose the vanity of religious ritual. In any case, this strengthened religion's opposition, for He had already done a sign on the Sabbath (5:10, 16). ",
  "2584":"Lit., from the age; i.e., from eternity. ",
  "2585":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "2586":"To cast him out was to excommunicate, to ostracize, him from the Jewish synagogue. This was to put him out of the sheepfold, as spoken by the Lord in 10:3-4. Religion's persecution of the Lord's called one did nothing but fulfill what the Lord intended for him. ",
  "2587":"Some ancient authorities read, Son of Man. ",
  "2588":"See note 9; so in the succeeding verses. ",
  "2589":"The sheepfold signifies the law, or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God's chosen people were kept and guarded in custody until Christ came. ",
  "2590":"Thieves and robbers (v. 8) signify those who came into Judaism, but not through Christ. ",
  "2591":"The blind man who received sight in the previous chapter was such a sheep. He was led by the Lord out of the Judaism-fold. Hence, this chapter is a continuation of ch. 9. ",
  "2592":"Christ is the door not only for God's elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in the Old Testament time, before Christ came, but also for God's chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law now that Christ has come. Thus, the Lord indicated here that He is the door not only through which God's elect may go in but also through which God's chosen people may go out. ",
  "2593":"The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available (e.g., in the wintertime or at night), the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional. Now that Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture (Gal. 3:23-25; 4:3-5). This should be final and permanent. Because they did not have such a revelation, the leaders in Judaism considered the law, on which Judaism was based, as permanent. As a result, they missed Christ and could not participate in Him as their pasture. ",
  "2594":"Gk. zoe. This word is used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life. ",
  "2595":"Gk. psuche, soul; i.e., soul-life, and so in the succeeding verses. As a man, the Lord has the psuche life, the human life, and as God, He has the zoe life, the divine life. He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep (vv. 15, 17-18) that they may share His zoe life, His divine life (v. 10b), the eternal life (v. 28), by which they can be formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd. As the good Shepherd, He feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose. ",
  "2596":"The other sheep are the Gentile believers (Acts 11:18).",
  "2597":"The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6), brought forth by the Lord's eternal, divine life, which He imparted into His members through His death (vv. 10-18). The fold is Judaism, which is of letter and regulation, and the flock is the church, which is of life and spirit. ",
  "2598":"From 170 B.C. to 168 B.C., Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, invaded Jerusalem and looted the temple. Moreover, on December 25, 168 B.C., he sacrificed a sow on the altar and set up an image in the temple, thus defiling and damaging the temple. Three years later, in 165 B.C., Judas Maccabaeus, a strong man of Judah, purified and restored the altar and the temple. He set December 25 &#151; the day on which the altar and the temple had been defiled &#151; as the beginning of a sacred feast that was to have eight consecutive days of rejoicing to celebrate the great achievement of the purification and restoration of the altar and the temple. This sacred feast is the Feast of the Dedication mentioned here. ",
  "2599":"See note 43 in ch. 5. ",
  "2600":"Eternal life (see note 15 in ch. 3) is for the believers' living. The Father's hand, by which He chooses in His love according to His purpose (17:23; 6:38-39), and the Son's hand, by which He saves by His grace for the fulfillment of the Father's purpose (1:14; 6:37), both of which have the keeping power, are for the believers' protection. Eternal life will never run out, and the hands of the Father and the Son will never fail. Hence, the believers are eternally secure and will never perish. ",
  "2601":"See note 28. ",
  "2602":"Here the Lord asserted His deity, that is, that He is God (v. 33; 5:18; 1:1; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Phil. 2:6). ",
  "2603":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2604":"At this point the Lord left the temple and went to the very place where John the Baptist had given the New Testament testimony concerning Him. This signifies that He abandoned Judaism and came to the new ground, where many believed into Him. ",
  "2605":"The Lord had left Judaism and had come to a place from which He could proceed to Bethany, which was an early miniature of the church. ",
  "2606":"In the eight foregoing cases, in chs. 3--10, religion was the main frustration to and opponent of life. Here, outside religion and on the new ground, life was going to raise a dead person. Here life no longer faced religion with its rituals, but it was frustrated by many human opinions: the disciples' opinions (vv. 8-16), Martha's opinion (vv. 21-28), Mary's opinion (vv. 32-33), the Jews' opinion (vv. 36-38), and, again, Martha's opinion (vv. 39-40). Opinions, which come from knowledge, belong to the tree of knowledge, but the Lord here was actually the tree of life for people to enjoy. ",
  "2607":"Lit., be saved. ",
  "2608":"In the Lord's salvation He does not merely heal the sick; He also gives life to the dead. Hence, He remained two days until the sick one had died (v. 6). The Lord does not reform or regulate people &#151; He regenerates people and raises them out of death. Hence, the first of the nine cases in chs. 3-11 was a case of regeneration, and the last was a case of resurrection, revealing that all the aspects of Christ as life to us, as unveiled in the other seven cases, are in the principle of regeneration and resurrection. This last case was the actual changing of death into life. ",
  "2609":"I.e., Twin. ",
  "2610":"I.e., about two miles. ",
  "2611":"The Lord told Martha, \"Your brother will rise again\" (v. 23). This meant that the Lord would raise him immediately; but Martha expounded the Lord's word so as to postpone the present resurrection to the last day. What an exposition of the divine word! Some of the knowledge of fundamental teaching is truly destructive and frustrates people from enjoying the Lord's present resurrection life. ",
  "2612":"The Lord said to Martha, \"I am the resurrection and the life,\" and asked her, \"Do you believe this?\" She answered, \"Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God.\" Her reply did not answer the Lord's question. Her old, preoccupying knowledge covered her, preventing her from understanding the Lord's new word. Man's old knowledge and old opinions are coverings that keep him from knowing clearly the Lord's new revelation. ",
  "2613":"This might have been Martha's opinion and not the Lord's command. ",
  "2614":"Lit., wail. ",
  "2615":"Lit., wailing. ",
  "2616":"This word differs from the word translated weep and weeping in vv. 31 and 33. Here it means to shed tears, to weep silently. This is the only time the word is used in the New Testament. ",
  "2617":"Their taking the stone away and loosing Lazarus were their submitting to and cooperating with the resurrection life. ",
  "2618":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2619":"The phrase gather into one the children of God mentioned in this chapter implies that not only the Lord's death but also the Lord's resurrection life are for the building up of God's children. By His death the Lord released His life so that it could be imparted into those who believe into Him. This life is experienced by us in His resurrection. It is in the Lord's resurrection that we grow together into one by His life to become His Body. ",
  "2620":"Bethany means house of affliction. At this point the Lord was outside Judaism. Through His resurrection life He had gained a house in Bethany where He could feast and have rest and satisfaction. This house of feasting was a miniature of the church life and depicted the situation of the church: (1) produced by the resurrection life &#151; Lazarus (11:43-44); (2) composed of cleansed sinners &#151; Simon the leper (Mark 14:3); (3) outwardly afflicted &#151; Bethany; (4) inwardly feasting in and with the presence of the Lord (v. 2); (5) having more sisters than brothers (vv. 2-3); (6) having members with different functions: serving &#151; Martha, testifying &#151; Lazarus, and loving &#151; Mary (vv. 2-3); (7) spotted by the false one &#151; Judas (v. 4); (8) persecuted by religion (v. 10); (9) being a test and exposing people (vv. 6, 10); and (10) bringing in many believers (v. 11). ",
  "2621":"A unit of weight at that time, about twelve ounces. ",
  "2622":"This was the house of Simon the leper (Mark 14:3). ",
  "2623":"See note 7 in ch. 6. ",
  "2624":"The Lord Jesus was a test to all those around Him. The chief priests and Pharisees conspired to kill Him (11:47, 53, 57), Simon the leper prepared his house for Him (Matt. 26:6), Martha served Him, Lazarus testified concerning Him, Mary loved Him (vv. 2-3), Judas was about to betray Him (v. 4), and many believed into Him (v. 11). The Lord is the center of God's economy and is a sign set up by God (Luke 2:34). Anyone who contacts Him will inevitably be tested and exposed. ",
  "2625":"A Hebrew expression that means save now (Psa. 118:25). ",
  "2626":"For Jesus as the Son of Man to be glorified was for Him to be resurrected, that is, to have His divine element, His divine life, released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), just as a grain of wheat (v. 24) has its life element released when it falls into the ground and grows up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains. See note 1 in ch. 17. ",
  "2627":"At this point, according to the worldly view, Jesus was in His golden time. A great crowd of the Jews esteemed Him highly and welcomed Him warmly because of the resurrection of Lazarus (vv. 12-19), and even the Greeks were seeking after Him (vv. 20-22). But He preferred to fall as a grain of wheat into the ground and die that He might produce many grains for the church. ",
  "2628":"This \"much fruit\" became Christ's increase in resurrection. This increase is the glory into which Christ entered through His death and resurrection (Luke 24:26). The portion from v. 23 of this chapter to the end of ch. 17 is a discourse on the mystery of this glory. Christ had the glory with God (17:5). His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh. Through His death and resurrection His glory was released, producing many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory. What was spoken in vv. 23, 28; 13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8; 16:14; and 17:1, 4, 5, 10, 22, 24 is related to this glory. In the Lord's last words to the believers in chs. 14--16, there are three concrete, corporate expressions of this glory: the Father's house (the church) in 14:2, the branches of the vine (the constituents of the Body of Christ) in 15:1-5, and a newborn corporate man (the new man) in 16:21. All three denote the church, showing that the church is the glorious increase produced by the glorious Christ through His death and resurrection. In this glorious increase, Christ, the Son of God, is glorified, causing God the Father also to be glorified in Christ's glorification, that is, to be fully expressed through the church (Eph. 3:19-21). This expression needs to be maintained in the oneness of the Triune God. Therefore, the Lord prayed in particular for this matter in His concluding prayer in ch. 17 (17:20-23). This glorious increase of Christ is the peak of the mystery revealed in the Gospel of John, and its ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem in Revelation, also written by John. The new holy city will be the aggregate of Christ's increase throughout the generations, and in it Christ's divine glory will be expressed to the uttermost. In the glorifying of God the Son, God the Father also will obtain eternal, matchless glory, which will be His full expression in eternity. Thus His eternal economy will be fulfilled for eternity. ",
  "2629":"The same Greek word as for life in 10:11, 15, 17. The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains. As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection. This is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on this way, the way of losing our soul-life and living in His resurrection, as mentioned in v. 26. ",
  "2630":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2631":"As a man, the Lord was troubled in His soul because of the death He was about to suffer. Hence, He prayed, \"Father, save Me out of this hour.\" However, it must have been that in His spirit He realized that it was for the glorifying of the Father that He had come to that hour. ",
  "2632":"This refers to the glorifying of the Father's name in the next verse. ",
  "2633":"To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father's divine element to be expressed. The Father's divine element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son's incarnation had to be broken through death that the Father's divine element, the eternal life, might be released and expressed in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by the breaking of its shell and is expressed by its blossom. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son. See note 1 in ch. 17. ",
  "2634":"Lit., happened. ",
  "2635":"On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man (v. 23) was lifted up in the form of the serpent (3:14), that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Satan as the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), the ruler of this world, had injected himself into man's flesh. Through His death on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin, the Lord destroyed Satan, who is in man's flesh (Heb. 2:14). By judging Satan (16:11) in this way, the Lord also judged the world, which is hanging on Satan. Hence, the Lord's being lifted up caused the world to be judged and its ruler, Satan, to be cast out. ",
  "2636":"The Greek word here means arrangement (see note 15 in 1 John 2). The world is an evil system arranged systematically by Satan. All the things on the earth, especially those related to mankind, and all the things in the air have been systematized by Satan into his kingdom of darkness to occupy people and frustrate them from accomplishing the purpose of God, and to distract them from the enjoyment of God. This evil system, the kingdom of darkness, was judged when its ruler, Satan, was cast out by the Lord's being crucified in the flesh. See note 31. ",
  "2637":"In one aspect, the Lord's death was His falling into the ground, as revealed in v. 24; in another aspect, it was His being lifted up on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). His falling into the ground was to produce the many grains; His being lifted up on the tree was to draw all men to Himself. The many grains produced by His falling into the ground are the \"all men\" drawn by His being lifted up on the tree. <br><br>   In this chapter the Lord's death is revealed not as the redeeming death but as the producing, generating death. By this death His incarnation-shell of humanity was broken that He might accomplish His threefold purpose: (1) the producing of many grains, the drawing of all men to Himself (vv. 24, 32); (2) the releasing of the divine element, the eternal life (vv. 23, 28); and (3) the judging of the world and the casting out of its ruler, Satan (v. 31). We must experience the Lord's death that we may participate in the threefold purpose that He accomplished. ",
  "2638":"The arm of the Lord is the Lord Jesus Himself. ",
  "2639":"These two, blindness and the hardening of the heart, are related; they are a punishment to the unbelieving ones. ",
  "2640":"His glory here confirms that the Lord Jesus is the very God, Jehovah of hosts, whose glory Isaiah saw (Isa. 6:1, 3). This glory was seen and appreciated by Isaiah but was not loved by the Lord's weaker believers (vv. 42-43). ",
  "2641":"This was the Lord's declaration to the unbelieving religionists. It implied that (1) He was God manifested to man (vv. 44-45); (2) He came as a light into the world so that by believing into Him man would not remain in darkness (vv. 46, 36); and (3) He came to man with the living words; whoever receives His words has eternal life now and forever, and whoever rejects His words will be judged by His words in the last day (vv. 47-50). ",
  "2642":"See note 63 in ch. 6; so in the next verse. ",
  "2643":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2644":"In this Gospel, the first section, chs. 1--13, describes how the Lord as God Himself, as the Son of God, came through His incarnation to bring God into man that He might be man's life for the producing of the church. The second section, chs. 14--21, describes how the Lord as the Son of Man went through His death and resurrection to bring man into God that man and God, God and man, might be built together as a mutual abode. This chapter, coming at the end of the first section, is a dividing line and a turning point. ",
  "2645":"The outer garments here signify the Lord's virtues and attributes in His expression. Hence, the laying aside of His outer garments signifies the putting off of what He is in His expression. ",
  "2646":"From a Latin word denoting a linen towel. ",
  "2647":"To gird oneself signifies to be bound and restricted with humility (cf. 1 Pet. 5:5). ",
  "2648":"Water here signifies the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5), the word (Eph. 5:26; John 15:3), and life (19:34). ",
  "2649":"In chs. 1--12 life came and brought forth the church, composed of the regenerated ones. In their spirit the regenerated ones are in God and in the heavenlies, but in their body they are still living in the flesh and walking on the earth. Through their contact with earthly things they often become dirty. This frustrates their fellowship with the Lord and with one another. Hence, there is the need for the washing with the Holy Spirit, the word, and life. This is the washing away of their dirtiness that their fellowship with the Lord and with one another may be maintained; it is not the washing away of their sins by the blood (1 John 1:9). This is why, after ch. 12, there is a need for such a sign in this chapter. Since this Gospel is a book of signs, what is recorded in this chapter should be considered a sign, having spiritual significance. Foot-washing should not be taken merely in a physical sense, but rather in a spiritual sense. ",
  "2650":"In ancient times the Jews wore sandals, and since their roads were dusty, their feet easily became dirty. If, when they came to a feast, they sat at the table and stretched out their feet, the dirt and the smell would certainly frustrate the fellowship. Hence, for the feast to be pleasant they needed foot-washing. The Lord washed His disciples' feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost (v. 1), and He charged them to do the same to one another in love (vv. 14, 34). Today the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated. For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing &#151; with the washing Holy Spirit, the washing word, and the washing life &#151; carried out both by the Lord in His love and by one another in love. This is absolutely necessary in order for us to live in the fellowship of the divine life, which is revealed in John's first Epistle, a continuation of the Gospel of John. ",
  "2651":"In Greek, know in the first instance denotes the inward, subjective consciousness; in the second it refers to the outward, objective knowledge. See note 55 in ch. 8. ",
  "2652":"Bathing here signifies the washing of regeneration (Titus 3:5; John 3:5). ",
  "2653":"One who is sent is, literally, an apostle. ",

  "2659":"See note 28 in ch. 12. ",
  "2660":"See note 23 in ch. 12. ",
  "2661":"The Greek word for commandment here is the same word as in Matt. 5:19 and Rom. 7:8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. However, in Matt. 5 and Rom. 7 it refers to the old commandments of the law in the Old Testament; here it refers to the new commandment given to us by the Lord in the New Testament. Also in 14:15, 21; 15:10, 12; 1 John 2:3, 4, 7, 8; 3:22, 23, 24; 4:21; 5:2, 3; 2 John 4, 5, 6, it refers to the new commandment given to us in the New Testament, either by the Lord Jesus or by God. This new commandment is different from the old commandments in the Old Testament. ",
  "2662":"Lit., soul, soul-life; so in the next verse. ",
  "2663":"Here the Lord showed His disciples that He is the same as God. The disciples were troubled upon hearing of His leaving. By this word He made them realize that as God He is omnipresent and is not limited by time and space. ",
  "2664":"According to the interpretation in 2:16, 21, My Father's house refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God's dwelling place. At first the body of Christ was only His individual body. But through Christ's death and resurrection, the body of Christ has increased to be His corporate Body, which is the church, including all His believers, who have been regenerated through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). In Christ's resurrection the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 3:6), God's habitation (Eph. 2:21-22), God's temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). ",
  "2665":"The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5), which is God's temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). This is adequately proven by v. 23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him. ",
  "2666":"This book has two main sections. The first section, chs. 1--13, points out how Christ, as the eternal Word, came through incarnation to bring God into man that He might be the life and life supply to man. The second section, chs. 14--21, unveils how Christ, as the man Jesus, went through death and resurrection to bring man into God for the building of God's habitation, which is the building of the church (Matt. 16:18) and which is related to the building of the New Jerusalem (Heb. 11:10; Rev. 21:2). In the entire universe God has only one building, that is, the building of His living habitation with His redeemed people. ",
  "2667":"If I go ...I am coming proves that the Lord's going (through His death and resurrection) was His coming (to His disciples &#151; vv. 18, 28). He came in the flesh (1:14) and was among His disciples, but He could not enter into them while He was in the flesh. He had to take the further step of passing through death and resurrection in order to be transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit that He might come into the disciples and dwell in them, as revealed in vv. 17-20. After His resurrection He did come to breathe Himself as the Holy Spirit into the disciples (20:19-22). ",
  "2668":"The Lord's intention in this chapter was to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place. But between man and God there were many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan. For the Lord to bring man into God, He had to solve all these problems. Therefore, He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption that He might open the way and make a standing for man, that man might enter into God. This standing in God, being enlarged, becomes the standing in the Body of Christ. Anyone who does not have a standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God's dwelling place. Hence, the Lord's going in order to accomplish redemption was to prepare a place in His Body for the disciples. ",
  "2669":"In receiving the disciples to Himself, the Lord put them into Himself, as indicated in v. 20 by the words you in Me. ",
  "2670":"The Lord is in the Father (vv. 10-11). He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in 17:21. Through His death and resurrection He brought His disciples into Himself. Since He is in the Father, they are in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where He is, the disciples are also. ",
  "2671":"The way for man to enter into God is the Lord Himself. Since the way is a living person, the place to which the Lord brings man must also be a person, God the Father Himself. The Lord Himself is the living way by which man is brought into God the Father, the living place. The way needs the reality, and the reality needs the life. The Lord Himself is the life to us. This life brings us the reality, and the reality becomes the way by which we enter into the enjoyment of God the Father. ",
  "2672":"Christ is the reality of the divine things. This reality came through Him and becomes the realization of God to us. See note 14 in ch. 1 and note 6 in 1 John 1. ",
  "2673":"This chapter unveils the way God dispenses Himself into man. In the dispensing of Himself into us, God is triune. He is one, yet He is three &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (vv. 7-11), and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (vv. 17-20). In the Son (the Son is even called the Father &#151; Isa. 9:6) the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) the Son is revealed and realized. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything. Hence, this Triune God &#151; the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit &#151; dispenses Himself into us to be our portion that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His divine trinity. ",
  "2674":"See note 63 in ch. 6. ",
  "2675":"The Lord came from the Father to bring God into man through His incarnation. Here, He is going to the Father to bring man into God through His death and resurrection. ",
  "2676":"To be in the Lord's name, here and in v. 14, means to be one with the Lord, to live by the Lord, and to let the Lord live in us. The Lord came and did things in the Father's name (5:43; 10:25), meaning that He was one with the Father (10:30), that He lived because of the Father (6:57), and that the Father worked in Him (v. 10). In the Gospels the Lord as the expression of the Father did things in the Father's name. In the Acts the disciples as the expression of the Lord did even greater things (v. 12) in the Lord's name. ",
  "2677":"For the Father to be glorified in the Son means that His divine element is expressed from within the Son. Whatever the Son does expresses the Father's divine element. This is the glorifying of the Father in the Son. ",
  "2678":"The Greek word here means advocate, one alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. The Greek word for Comforter is the same as that for Advocate in 1 John 2:1. Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens and the Spirit (the Comforter) within us as our Advocate, who takes care of our case. ",
  "2679":"The Spirit promised here was referred to in 7:39. This Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and this promise of the Lord's was fulfilled on the day of the Lord's resurrection, when the Spirit as the breath of life was breathed into the disciples (20:22). The Lord's promise here is different from the promise of the Father concerning the Spirit of power in Luke 24:49. That promise was fulfilled fifty days after the Lord's resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit as the mighty wind blew upon the disciples (Acts 2:1-4). In this verse the Spirit of life is called \"the Spirit of reality.\" This Spirit of reality is Christ (v. 6); hence, the Spirit of reality is the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9). This Spirit is also the reality of Christ (1 John 5:6, 20) that Christ may be realized in those who believe into Him, as their life and life supply. ",
  "2680":"The very \"He\" who is the Spirit of reality in this verse becomes the very \"I\" who is the Lord Himself in v. 18. This means that the Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. First Corinthians 15:45 confirms this. In dealing with the matter of resurrection, that verse says, \"The last Adam [Christ in the flesh] became a life-giving Spirit.\" ",
  "2681":"This is the first time that the promise of the Spirit's indwelling is revealed. It is fulfilled and fully developed in the Epistles. See 1 Cor. 6:19 and Rom. 8:9, 11. ",
  "2682":"See note 17. ",
  "2683":"This coming was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection (20:19-22). After His resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples to be with them forever, thus not leaving them as orphans. ",
  "2684":"It should be after His resurrection that the Lord lives in His disciples and that they live by Him, as mentioned in Gal. 2:20. ",
  "2685":"This should refer to the day of the Lord's resurrection (20:19). ",
  "2686":"This is one of the many abodes mentioned in v. 2. It will be a mutual abode, in which the Triune God abides in the believers and the believers abide in Him. ",
  "2687":"The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was to be sent by the Father in the Son's name. Therefore, the Holy Spirit was sent by the Father and also by the Son. Thus, the Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He is the reality not only of the Father but also of the Son. Hence, when we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). ",
  "2688":"The Father being in the Son's name is equivalent to the Father being the Son (see note 43 in ch. 5). Therefore, the Father's sending of the Holy Spirit in the Son's name is the Son's sending of the Holy Spirit from the Father (15:26). The Son and the Father are one (10:30). Hence, the Spirit who is sent comes not only out of the Father (15:26) but also out of the Son. Moreover, when the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father and the Son (see note 26 in ch. 15). This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, the Triune God, who reaches us and is working, that is, dispensing, Himself into us in His divine trinity to be our life and everything. ",
  "2689":"In 5:43 we are told that the Son came in the Father's name, and here that the Father sent the Holy Spirit in the Son's name. This proves not only that the Son and the Father are one (10:30) but also that the Holy Spirit is one with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit, who is sent by the Father in the Son's name, is not only the reality that comes from the Father but also the reality that comes from the Son. This is the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; who reaches man eventually as the Spirit. ",
  "2690":"See note 18. ",
  "2691":"See note 12. ",
  "2692":"This true vine (the Son) with its branches (the believers in the Son) is the organism of the Triune God in God's economy. This organism grows with His riches and expresses His divine life. ",
  "2693":"The Greek word means cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer (2 Tim. 2:6; James 5:7; Matt. 21:33). The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. The Son as the vine is the center of God's economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all His riches into the vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father in a corporate way through its branches. This is the Father's economy in the universe. ",
  "2694":"Lit., cleanses. ",
  "2695":"Lit., from. ",
  "2696":"For a branch to be cast out means that it is cut off from participation in the riches of the life of the vine. ",
  "2697":"See note 63 in ch. 6. ",
  "2698":"When we abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, we actually are one with Him, and He works within us. Then, when we ask in prayer for whatever we will, it is not only we who are praying; He too is praying, in our praying. This kind of prayer is related to fruit-bearing (v. 8) and will surely be answered. See note 16. ",
  "2699":"In fruit-bearing the Father's divine life is expressed; hence, He is glorified. ",
  "2700":"When we abide in the Lord, He speaks His instant words within us. These words are His commandments to us. If we keep those commandments, it shows that we love Him; it is thus that we will abide in His love. ",
  "2701":"Being branches of the divine vine and bearing fruit to express the divine life are matters of joy, and they also issue in a joyful life. ",
  "2702":"The Greek word here means soul, soul-life. ",
  "2703":"We were wild branches, and through faith we have been grafted into Christ. Here the Lord said that He set us. This fits the thought of grafting.",
  "2704":"The Greek word for go forth means to depart, implying to leave for another place; hence, it is rendered go forth. It is the same Greek word as that for go in 14:4 and 16:5. The fruit borne by going forth in this way does not denote the virtues of the fruit-bearer's character, such as the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the believer's living, mentioned in Gal. 5:22-23, but it denotes the believers produced by the fruit-bearer. This corresponds with the subject of this section, 12:20--17:26, which is Christ's multiplication. The virtues we possess through our abiding in the Lord cannot be counted as Christ's multiplication. Only the believers that we produce in the Lord are the tangible multiplication of Christ. The Father's house in ch. 14, the true vine in this chapter, and the man-child in ch. 16 are all related to the multiplication of Christ. ",
  "2705":"After we go forth to produce believers in the Lord, we need to care for them. The best way is to set up meetings in their homes to cover and protect them that they may be cared for by being nourished and taught, and may become the remaining fruit, living in the branches of the true vine, that is, in the Body of Christ, to be Christ's increase. ",
  "2706":"The same Greek word used for abide in this chapter. ",
  "2707":"To ask in the Lord's name requires us to abide in the Lord and allow Him and His words to abide in us that we may actually be one with Him. Then when we ask, He asks in our asking. This kind of asking is related to fruit-bearing and will surely be answered by the Father. See note 7. ",
  "2708":"This is to love one another in the Lord's life, the divine life, in the Lord's love, and in His commission of fruit-bearing. Life is the source, love is the condition, and fruit-bearing is the goal. If we all live by the Lord's life as the source, in the Lord's love as the condition, and for fruit-bearing as the goal, we surely will love one another. Having different sources of life, different conditions, or different goals will separate us and prevent us from loving one another. ",
  "2709":"Lit., out of. ",
  "2710":"The sense in Greek is from with (see note 14 in ch. 1). The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father. The Father is the source. When this Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but comes with the source. This Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, testifies concerning the Son. Therefore, His testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God. ",
  "2711":"In this Gospel religion is revealed as the enemy of life. In the Gospels, Judaism opposed and persecuted the Lord Jesus. In the Acts it continued by opposing and persecuting the apostles and the disciples (Acts 4:1-3; 5:17-18, 40; 6:11-14; 7:57-59; 26:9-12). In subsequent history the Catholic Church persecuted the Lord's followers. All organized religions, of whatever kind, persecute those who seek the Lord in life. All these religions consider their persecuting of the Lord's seekers a service offered to God. ",
  "2712":"This \"going\" was ultimately fulfilled by His ascension in 20:17. ",
  "2713":"To convict means to convince, to condemn, to cause people to rebuke themselves. ",
  "2714":"Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (v. 10; 1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan (v. 11), who is the author and source of sin (8:44). In Adam we were born of sin. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe into Christ, the Son of God (v. 9). If we believe into Him, He is righteousness to us, and we are justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin that is in Adam and believe into Christ, the Son of God, we will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41). These are the main points of the gospel. The Spirit uses these points to convict the world. ",
  "2715":"The work of the Spirit is, first, to convict the world. Second, as the Spirit of reality He guides the believers into all the reality; that is, He makes all that the Son is and has real to the believers. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is declared as reality to the believers through the Spirit (vv. 14-15). This declaring is the glorifying of the Son with the Father. Hence, it is a matter of the Triune God being wrought into and mingled with the believers. Third, the Spirit declares the things that are to come, which are revealed mainly in Revelation (Rev. 1:1, 19). The three aspects of the Spirit's work correspond with the three sections of John's writings: his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation. ",
  "2716":"The bringing forth here is the begetting in Acts 13:33. The incarnated Christ, including all His believers, was begotten in His resurrection to be the Son of God (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, He has become the firstborn Son of God, and all His believers have become God's many sons as His brothers to constitute His church (Rom. 8:29; John 20:17 and note 2; Heb. 2:10-12) as His multiplication (12:24), His increase (3:29-30), and His Body, which is His fullness, His expression (Eph. 1:23). ",
  "2717":"In this parable the Lord indicated that the disciples were then like a woman travailing in birth, and that He was the little child to be brought forth in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4). ",
  "2718":"After being born in resurrection, the Lord came to see the disciples in the evening of the day of His resurrection, and the disciples rejoiced at His presence (20:20). ",
  "2719":"Or, Whatever you ask the Father, He will give to you in My name. ",
  "2720":"See note 16 in ch. 15; so in v. 26. ",
  "2721":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "2722":"Some MSS read, came forth from the Father. The word from in these MSS is the same as that in v. 27. ",
  "2723":"The word from used by the disciples here does not have the sense of from with. It is different from the word used by the Lord in v. 27. ",
  "2724":"See note 16 in ch. 8. ",
  "2725":"This is the subject of the Lord's prayer in this chapter. He was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth (1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by the three disciples (Matt. 17:1-4; John 1:14). But then it was concealed again in His flesh. Before this prayer He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (12:23; 13:31-32). Now He was about to pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken and His divine element, His divine life, might be released. Also, He would resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified (see note 23 in ch. 12). The Father would thus be glorified in Him (see note 28 in ch. 12). Hence, He prayed for this. <br><br>   The Lord's prayer here concerning the divine mystery is fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers (12:23-24), and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory (Luke 24:26), and in that the Father's divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In His resurrection God answered and fulfilled His prayer (Acts 3:13-15). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them, and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church (Eph. 3:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). Third, it will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23-24). <br><br>   In praying in this way, the Lord unveiled His person, His deity; He is the same as the Father in the divine glory. ",
  "2726":"This indicates the Lord's work. The Lord has the Father's authority over all mankind that He may give eternal life, not to all mankind but only to those whom the Father has given Him &#151; the Father's chosen ones. ",
  "2727":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "2728":"Eternal life is the divine life with a special function, that is, to know God and Christ (cf. Matt. 11:27). God and Christ are divine. To know the divine person, we need the divine life. Since the believers are born of the divine life, they know God and Christ (Heb. 8:11; Phil. 3:10). ",
  "2729":"See note 6 in ch. 1; so in vv. 8, 18, 21, 23, 25. ",
  "2730":"This means that while He was living on earth, the Lord manifested and expressed the Father. ",
  "2731":"This word strengthens the indication in v. 1, concerning the deity of the Lord's person. He had the divine glory along with the Father before the world was, in eternity past; hence, He should be glorified now with that glory along with the Father. The Lord participates in the divine glory not by Himself but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one (10:30). ",
  "2732":"Your name, here and in v. 26, means the very name Father. The name God and the name Jehovah were adequately revealed to man in the Old Testament, but the name Father was not, though it was mentioned briefly in Isa. 9:6; 63:16; 64:8. The Son came and worked in the Father's name (5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to the men whom the Father gave Him and to make the Father's name known to them (v. 26). That name reveals the Father as the source of life (5:26) for the propagation and multiplication of life. Many sons would be born of the Father (1:12-13) to express the Father. Hence, the Father's name is very much related to the divine life. ",
  "2733":"The Father's words are of two kinds: the constant word (v. 6) and the instant words (v. 8). Both are used by the Lord to impart eternal life to the believers who receive both kinds of words. ",
  "2734":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "2735":"Since the disciples expressed the Lord, He was glorified in them. ",
  "2736":"I.e., because of them. ",
  "2737":"The Son's believers are still in the world. They need to be kept that they may be one even as the Divine Trinity is one, that is, that they may be one in the Divine Trinity. The Son prayed that the holy Father would so keep them. ",
  "2738":"To be kept in the Father's name is to be kept by His life, because only those who are born of the Father and have the Father's life can participate in the Father's name. The Son has given the Father's life to those whom the Father has given Him (v. 2); hence, they share the Father's name by being kept in it, and they are one in it. The first aspect of this oneness, that is, the first aspect of the building up of the believers, is the oneness in the Father's name and by His divine life. In this aspect of oneness the believers, born of the Father's life, enjoy the Father's name, that is, the Father Himself, as the factor of their oneness. ",
  "2739":"Perished (a verb) and perdition (a noun) are from the same Greek root. ",
  "2740":"The Lord has given the believers two kinds of words: the constant word (vv. 14, 17) and the instant words (v. 8). ",
  "2741":"The world is the system of Satan (12:31). The believers are not of the world (vv. 14, 16) but are separated from the world (v. 19), and are not taken out of the world (v. 15) but are sent into the world (v. 18) for the Lord's commission. (So in vv. 15, 16.) ",
  "2742":"Lit., out of; so in v. 16. ",
  "2743":"Or, out of the evil. ",
  "2744":"The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19). Hence, the believers need to be kept out of the hands of the evil one, and they need always to be watchful in prayer that they may be delivered from the evil one (Matt. 6:13). ",
  "2745":"To be sanctified (Eph. 5:26; 1 Thes. 5:23) is to be separated from the world and its usurpation unto God and His purpose, not only positionally (Matt. 23:17, 19) but also dispositionally (Rom. 6:19, 22). God's living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly. This is to be sanctified in God's word, which is the truth, the reality. ",
  "2746":"Or, in the reality. Reality is the Triune God (1:14, 17; 14:6; 1 John 5:6). Since the Triune God is contained and concealed in His word, His word is reality (see notes 14 in ch. 1 and 6 in 1 John 1). We are sanctified in the reality of this word. ",
  "2747":"The Father's word carries the reality of the Father with it. When God's word says, \"God is light,\" it carries God as light in it. Hence, God's word is reality, the truth, unlike Satan's word, which is vanity, a lie (8:44). ",
  "2748":"The Father sent the Son into the world with Himself as life and everything to the Son. In the same way, the Son sends His believers into the world with Himself as life and everything to the believers. See note 21 in ch. 20. ",
  "2749":"The Son is absolutely holy in Himself. Yet, to set an example of sanctification for His disciples, He still sanctified Himself in His way of living while He was on earth. ",
  "2750":"This is the second aspect of the believers' oneness, the oneness in the Triune God through sanctification, separation from the world by the word of God. In this aspect of oneness the believers, separated from the world unto God, enjoy the Triune God as the factor of their oneness. ",
  "2751":"The glory that the Father gave to the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature (5:26). The sonship was given so that the Son could express the Father in His fullness (1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). The Son has given this glory to His believers that they too may have the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature (v. 2; 2 Pet. 1:4) to express the Father in the Son in the Son's fullness (1:16). ",
  "2752":"This is the third aspect of the believers' oneness, the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of God. In this aspect of oneness the believers, their self having been fully denied, enjoy the glory of the Father as the factor of their perfected oneness and thus express God in a corporate, built-up way. This is the oneness of the divine commission; it fulfills the Son's prayer that He be fully expressed, that is, glorified, in the building up of the believers, and that the Father be fully expressed, glorified, in the Son's glorification. Hence, the ultimate oneness of the believers is (1) in the eternal life of God (in the Father's name), (2) by the holy word of God, and (3) in the divine glory to express the Triune God for eternity. That the Son might accomplish this oneness, the Father gave Him six things: the authority (v. 2), the believers (vv. 2, 6, 9, 24), the work (v. 4), the words (v. 8), the Father's name (vv. 11-12), and the Father's glory (v. 24). That the believers may participate in this oneness, the Son gave them three things: the eternal life (v. 2), the holy word of God (vv. 8, 14), and the divine glory (v. 22). (So also for one in v. 23.) ",
  "2753":"The Father loved the Son by giving the Son His life, His nature, His fullness, and His glory that the Son might express Him. In the same way, the Father loved the Son's believers by giving them His life, His nature, His fullness, and His glory that they might express Him in the Son. This is a story of love as well as glory. ",
  "2754":"The Son is in the divine glory of the Father's expression. Therefore, for the Son's believers to be with Him where He is means that they are with Him in the divine glory to express the Father. The fulfillment of this matter began with the Son's resurrection, when He brought His believers into participation in His resurrection life, and will consummate in the New Jerusalem, when His believers will be brought fully into the divine glory for the ultimate corporate expression of the Triune God in eternity. ",
  "2755":"The world neither knows nor wants the Father, but the Son and the Son's believers do. Hence, the Father loves the Son and His believers so that He gives His glory to both the Son and His believers. In this matter He is righteous and just. In sanctifying the Son's believers, the Father is holy (v. 11). In loving the Son and His believers so that He gives the Son and the believers His glory, the Father is righteous. ",
  "2756":"The love here is the love of the Father. In this love the Father gave His life and glory to the Son and His believers so that the Son and His believers can express Him. The Son prayed that this love would be in His believers and that they would always have the sense of this love. ",
  "2757":"The Lord delivered Himself of His own accord to the process of death, as He had indicated in 10:17-18. He did it voluntarily and boldly. ",
  "2758":"See note 1. ",
  "2759":"I Am is the name of Jehovah (so in vv. 6, 8). See note 24 in ch. 8. When the soldiers heard this name, they drew back and fell to the ground. ",
  "2760":"While suffering betrayal at the hands of His false disciple and arrest by the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples. This reveals that He was at ease in passing through the process of death. ",
  "2761":"This word, too, shows that the Lord was willing to pass through the process of death. ",
  "2762":"The Lord was the Lamb of God (1:29), and He was killed on the day of the Passover (v. 28). As the Passover lamb was examined before it was killed (Exo. 12:3-6), so He was examined by the whole of mankind, represented by the high priest of the Jews and the governor of the Romans, and proved to be without blemish (v. 38b; 19:4, 6). See note 37 in Mark 12. ",
  "2763":"While judging the Lord, both the high priest of the Jewish religion and the governor of the Roman Empire were judged by Him in His dignity. ",
  "2764":"The governor's official residence. ",
  "2765":"A reference to the fourth watch, 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. ",
  "2766":"The Jews' way to put criminals to death was to stone them (Lev. 24:16). But the Lord Jesus predicted, according to the type in the Old Testament (Num. 21:8-9), that He would be lifted up (3:14; 8:28; 12:32). It was of God's sovereignty that not long before that time the Roman Empire had made it a law that criminals sentenced to death should be crucified. It was in this way that the Lord was executed. This proves that the Lord's death was not accidental but was predetermined by God (Acts 2:23). ",
  "2767":"See note 21. ",
  "2768":"Lit., out of; so in v. 37. ",
  "2769":"The world. ",
  "2770":"In view of the entire revelation of this book, truth here denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. See notes 14 in ch. 1 and 6 in 1 John 1. ",
  "2771":"See note 29 in Matt. 27. ",
  "2772":"The governor's official residence. ",
  "2773":"An Aramaic term from Hebrew, meaning a raised place. This must have been an elevated place, like a raised platform, paved with beautiful stones, as indicated by the Greek word for Pavement, mentioned earlier in the verse. ",
  "2774":"See note 62 in Matt. 27. ",
  "2775":"I.e., 6:00 a.m. ",
  "2776":"This unjust, joint sentence exposed the blindness of religion and the darkness of politics. ",
  "2777":"Hebrew here represents the Hebrew religion, Latin represents Roman politics, and Greek represents Greek culture. These three together represent the entire world, all of mankind. This signifies that the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God was killed by and for all mankind. ",
  "2778":"What Pilate wrote was not of himself but of God's sovereignty. ",
  "2779":"In His crucifixion, the Lord's right to be clothed (vv. 23-24) and to drink (vv. 28-30) was stripped from Him, along with His life. ",
  "2780":"A shirt-like undergarment. ",
  "2781":"This was not of the soldiers but of God's sovereignty. ",
  "2782":"Salome (Mark 15:40), the wife of Zebedee and the mother of James and John (Matt. 27:56). ",
  "2783":"In Luke 23:43 the Lord said to one of the two thieves crucified with Him, \"Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.\" That word was in regard to salvation, since Luke's Gospel proves that the Lord is the sinner's Savior. Here, in vv. 26-27, the Lord said to His mother, \"Behold, your son,\" and to the disciple whom He loved, \"Behold, your mother.\" These words indicate a life-union, since this Gospel testifies that the Lord is life imparted into His believers. It is by this life that His beloved disciple could be one with Him and become the son of His mother, and that she could become the mother of His beloved disciple. ",
  "2784":"See note 26. ",
  "2785":"Thirst is a taste of death (Luke 16:24; Rev. 21:8). The Lord Jesus suffered this for us on the cross (Heb. 2:9). ",
  "2786":"In Matt. 27:34 and Mark 15:23, wine mingled with gall and myrrh was offered to the Lord as a stupefying drink before His crucifixion, but He would not drink it. In this verse vinegar was offered to Him in a mocking way at the end of His crucifixion (Luke 23:36). ",
  "2787":"In His crucifixion the Lord was still working, and through His crucifixion He finished the work of His all-inclusive death, by which He accomplished redemption, terminated the old creation, and released His resurrection life to bring forth the new creation to fulfill God's purpose. In the process of death He proved to His opposers and His believers, by the way He behaved, that He was life. The dreadful environment of death did not frighten Him in the least; rather, it provided a contrast that proved strongly that He, as life, was versus death and could not be affected by death in any way. Therefore, the work that the Lord finished here included the accomplishing of redemption, the termination of the old creation, the release of His resurrection life, and the displaying of Himself as the life that cannot be affected by death. ",
  "2788":"Two substances came out of the Lord's pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death (12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30). The Lord's death, on the negative side, takes away our sins, and on the positive side, imparts life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the other three Gospels portrays only the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death; John's record portrays not only the redemptive aspect but also the life-imparting aspect. In Matt. 27:45, 51, Mark 15:33, and Luke 23:44-45, darkness, a symbol of sin, appeared, and the veil of the temple, which separated man from God, was rent. These signs are related to the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death. The words spoken by the Lord on the cross in Luke 23:34, \"Father, forgive them,\" and in Matt. 27:46, \"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\" (because He bore our sin at that time), also depict the redemptive aspect of His death. But the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned by John in vv. 34 and 36 are signs that relate to the life-imparting aspect of the Lord's death (see note 26). This death that imparts life released the Lord's divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all His believers, into whom His divine life has been imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord's is typified by Adam's sleep, out from which Eve was produced (Gen. 2:21-23), and is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains (12:24) to make the one bread &#151; the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, it is also the life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death. <br><br>   The Lord's pierced side was prefigured by Adam's opened side, out from which Eve was produced (Gen. 2:21-23). The blood was typified by the blood of the Passover lamb (Exo. 12:7, 22; Rev. 12:11), and the water was typified by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). The blood formed a fountain for the washing away of sin (Zech. 13:1), and the water became the fountain of life (Psa. 36:9; Rev. 21:6). ",
  "2789":"It was absolutely of God's sovereignty that these things happened in such a meaningful and wonderful way. This is further proof that the Lord's death was not accidental but had been planned by God before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:19-20). ",
  "2790":"In the Scripture the first mention of a bone is in Gen. 2:21-23; there it was a rib taken out of Adam for the producing and building of Eve as a match for Adam. Eve was a type of the church, which is produced and built with the Lord's resurrection life released out of Him. Hence, the bone is a symbol, a figure, of the Lord's resurrection life, which nothing can break. The Lord's side was pierced, but not one of His bones was broken. This signifies that although the Lord's physical life was terminated, His resurrection life, the very divine life, could not be hurt or damaged by anything. This is the life with which the church is produced and built; it is also the eternal life, which we have obtained by believing into Him (3:36). ",
  "2791":"After the Lord accomplished His redemptive and life-imparting death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into a situation of honor. Joseph, a rich man (Matt. 27:57), and Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews (3:1), came to take care of His burial, binding His body with myrrh and aloes and burying it in a new tomb with the rich (Isa. 53:9). In human honor of a high standard, the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to rise from the dead. ",
  "2792":"See note 3 in ch. 12. ",
  "2793":"The first day of the week, or the day after the Sabbath, signifies a new beginning, a new age. In Lev. 23:10-11, 15, a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest was offered to the Lord as a wave offering on the day after the Sabbath. That sheaf of the firstfruits was a type of Christ as the firstfruits in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20, 23). Christ resurrected on precisely the day after the Sabbath. By His all-inclusive death He terminated the old creation, which had been completed in six days, after which was the Sabbath day. In His resurrection He germinated the new creation with the divine life. Hence, the day of His resurrection was the beginning of a new week &#151; a new age. This day of His resurrection was appointed by God (Psa. 118:24), was prophesied as \"this day\" in Psa. 2:7, was predicted by Himself as the third day (Matt. 16:21; John 2:19, 22), and later was called by the early Christians \"the Lord's Day\" (Rev. 1:10). On this day Christ was born in resurrection as the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5) and the Firstborn from the dead to be the Head of the Body, the church (Col. 1:18). ",
  "2794":"The Lord's resurrection had been accomplished, but the discovery of it required the disciples' seeking in love toward the Lord. It was thus that Mary the Magdalene discovered it and obtained the fresh manifestation of the Lord and the revelation of the issue of His resurrection: that His Father is the Father of those who believe into Him, and that those who believe into Him are His brothers (v. 17; see notes 17 and 17). Peter and John only knew of the discovery; Mary obtained the experience. The brothers were satisfied with having faith in the fact of the Lord's resurrection, but the sister went further and sought the resurrected Lord Himself, i.e., the personal experience of the Lord. The Lord was there all the time, but He was not manifested until v. 16.",
  "2795":"All the things that were cast off from the Lord's resurrected body and left in His tomb signify the old creation, which He wore into the tomb. He was crucified with the old creation and buried with it. But He rose from within it, leaving it in the tomb and becoming the firstfruits of the new creation. All the things left in the tomb were a testimony to the Lord's resurrection. If these things had not been left there in good order, it would have been difficult for Peter and John to believe (v. 8) that the Lord had not been taken away by someone but had risen by Himself. These things had been offered to the Lord and wrapped around Him by His two disciples, Joseph and Nicodemus (19:38-42). What they had done toward the Lord in their love to Him became very useful in the Lord's testimony. (So for linen cloths in v. 6.) ",
  "2796":"See note 5. ",
  "2797":"The Lord is not only life but also resurrection (11:25). Hence, death cannot hold Him (Acts 2:24). He went into death of His own accord to accomplish His work. When He finished His mission, He came out of death and rose up from it. ",
  "2798":"Lit., wailing; so in vv. 13, 15. ",
  "2799":"On the day of His resurrection the Lord ascended to the Father. This was a secret ascension, the ultimate fulfillment of the going predicted in 16:7. It occurred forty days prior to His public ascension, which took place before the eyes of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11). On the day of resurrection, early in the morning He ascended to satisfy the Father, and late in the evening He returned to the disciples (v. 19). The freshness of His resurrection must be first for the Father's enjoyment, as in the type the firstfruits of the harvest were brought first to God. ",
  "2800":"Previously, the most intimate term the Lord had used in reference to His disciples was \"friends\" (15:14-15). But after His resurrection He began to call them \"brothers,\" for through His resurrection His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) with the divine life, which had been released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in 12:24. He was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died and grew up to bring forth many grains for the producing of the one bread, which is His Body (1 Cor. 10:17). He was the Father's only Son, the Father's individual expression. Through His death and resurrection the Father's only begotten became the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). His many brothers are the many sons of God and are the church (Heb. 2:10-12), a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. This is God's ultimate intention. The many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life. Hence, in the Lord's resurrection God's eternal purpose is fulfilled. ",
  "2801":"Through His life-imparting death and resurrection, the Lord made His disciples one with Him. Therefore, His Father is the Father of His disciples, and His God is the God of His disciples. In His resurrection they have the Father's life and God's divine nature, just as He has. In making them His brothers, He has imparted the Father's life and God's divine nature into them. By making His Father and His God theirs, He has brought them into His position &#151; the position of the Son &#151; before the Father and God. Thus, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are the same as the Lord, with whom they have been united. ",
  "2802":"The gathering of the disciples here may be considered the first meeting of the church before Pentecost. This meeting took place to fulfill Psa. 22:22, according to Heb. 2:10-12, so that the Son could declare the Father's name to His brothers and praise the Father in the church, which is composed of His brothers. ",
  "2803":"Though the doors were shut, the Lord came with His resurrected body (Luke 24:37-40; 1 Cor. 15:44) into the room where the disciples were. How could He have entered, having bones and flesh? Our limited mind cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact! We must receive it according to the divine revelation. This was a fulfillment of His promise in 16:16, 19, 22. ",
  "2804":"This was a fulfillment of the Lord's promise in 16:22. Now they rejoiced because they saw the newborn child (16:21), who was the resurrected Lord, born in His resurrection as the Son of God (Acts 13:33). The Lord fulfilled His promise and came back to His disciples, bringing them five blessings: (1) His presence, (2) His peace, (3) His sending, His commission (v. 21), (4) the Holy Spirit (v. 22), and (5) His authority, with which they could represent Him (v. 23). ",
  "2805":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "2806":"The Lord sent His disciples with Himself as life and everything to them. (See note 18 in ch. 17.) This is why, immediately after He said, \"I also send you,\" He breathed the Holy Spirit into them. By His breathing into them He entered as the Spirit into the disciples to abide in them forever (14:16-17). Hence, wherever His disciples were sent, He was always with them. He was one with them. ",
  "2807":"This was the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13. Hence, the Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. This fulfillment differs from the one in Acts 2:1-4, which was the fulfillment of the Father's promise in Luke 24:49. (See note 17 in ch. 14.) In Acts 2 the Spirit as a rushing, violent wind came as power upon the disciples for their work (Acts 1:8). Here the Spirit as breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself into them as life and everything. Thus, all that He had spoken in chs. 14--16 could be fulfilled. <br><br>   As falling into the ground to die and growing out of the ground transform the grain of wheat into another form, one that is new and living, so the death and resurrection of the Lord transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh, through the process of death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water (7:38-39). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them (14:16-17). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and enable them to live by and with Him (14:19). It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and enable them to abide in Him (14:20; 15:4-5). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to His lover and make an abode with him (14:23). It is as the Spirit that He can cause all that He is and has to be fully realized by the disciples (16:13-16). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father's name to them and to praise the Father in their midst (Heb. 2:11-12). It is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples for His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him (v. 21). They are thus qualified to represent Him with His authority in the fellowship of His Body (v. 23) for the carrying out of His commission. <br><br>   The Lord was the Word, and the Word is the eternal God (1:1). For the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (1:14), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (1:29), to declare God to man (1:18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (14:9-11). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything, and that He might bring forth many sons of God, His many brothers, for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. Hence, originally He was the eternal Word; then, through His incarnation He became flesh to accomplish God's redemption, and through His death and resurrection He became the Spirit to be everything and do everything for the completion of God's building. <br><br>   This Gospel testifies that the Lord is (1) God (1:1-2; 5:17-18; 10:30-33; 14:9-11; 20:28), (2) the life (1:4; 10:10; 11:25; 14:6), and (3) the resurrection (11:25). Chapters 1--17 prove that He is God among men. Men are in contrast to Him as God. Chapters 18--19 prove that He is life in the environment of death. Death, or the environment of death, is in contrast to Him as life. Chapters 20--21 prove that He is the resurrection in the midst of the old creation, the natural life. The old creation, the natural life, is in contrast to Him as the resurrection, of which the Spirit is the reality. As the resurrection, He can be realized only in the Spirit. Hence, eventually He is the Spirit in resurrection. He is God among men (chs. 1--17), He is life in death (chs. 18--19), and He is the Spirit in resurrection (chs. 20--21). ",
  "2808":"I.e., Twin. ",
  "2809":"After His resurrection the Lord came to meet with His disciples, beginning from the evening of this first day. Thus, in the Lord's resurrection the matter of meeting with the saints is crucial. Mary the Magdalene met the Lord personally in the morning and obtained the blessing (vv. 16-18), but she still needed to be in the meeting with the saints in the evening to meet the Lord in a corporate way to obtain more and greater blessings (vv. 19-23). Thomas missed the first meeting that the Lord held with His disciples after His resurrection, and he missed all the blessings as well. However, he compensated for it by attending the second meeting (vv. 25-28). ",
  "2810":"This was on the second first day of the week, the second Lord's Day after the Lord's resurrection. ",
  "2811":"The gathering of the disciples here may be considered the second meeting of the church held with the Lord's presence before Pentecost. ",
  "2812":"After the Lord came in v. 19, eight days before, there is no plain word or hint in John's record that the Lord left the disciples. Actually, He stayed with them, though they were not conscious of His presence. Hence, His coming in v. 26 was actually His manifestation, His appearing (see note 1 in ch. 21). Before His death the Lord was in the flesh, and His presence was visible. After His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit, and His presence was invisible. His manifestations, or appearings, after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, to enjoy, and to practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real than His visible presence. In His resurrection this dear presence of His was just the Spirit, whom He had breathed into them and who would be with them all the time. ",
  "2813":"This Gospel proves strongly and purposely that the man Jesus is the very God (1:1-2; 5:17-18; 10:30-33; 14:9-11). ",
  "2814":"The Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission. The Son of God is His title according to His person. His person is a matter of God's life, and His mission is a matter of God's work. He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God. He works for God by the life of God that man, by believing in Him, may have God's life to become God's many sons and work by God's life to build the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), thus fulfilling God's purpose concerning His eternal building. ",
  "2815":"By the end of ch. 20 the Lord had come back as the Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ, to be with the disciples as everything to them. Therefore, this Gospel might be considered closed there (20:30-31). But how could the disciples make a living? What should they do to carry out His commission? How should they follow Him after His resurrection? What would be their future? This additional chapter is needed that these problems might be dealt with. ",
  "2816":"This proves that His coming to the disciples in 20:26 was actually a manifestation, for here it is said that He manifested Himself again to the disciples. He was again training them to practice His invisible presence. It was a matter not of His coming but of His manifestation. Whether or not they were conscious of His presence, He was with them all the time. Because of their weakness He sometimes manifested His presence in order to strengthen their faith in Him. ",
  "2817":"I.e., Twin. ",
  "2818":"It must have been because of the trial related to their need to make a living that Peter returned to his old occupation, thus backsliding from the Lord's call (Matt. 4:19-20; Luke 5:3-11). ",
  "2819":"Peter and the sons of Zebedee (John and James) were professional fishermen, the Sea of Tiberias was large and full of fish, and night was the right time for fishing; still, through the entire night they caught nothing. This was a miracle! It must have been that the Lord bade all the fish to stay away from their net. ",
  "2820":"Fish is not in the Greek text; however, because the Greek word here refers to something prepared for eating, fish is implied. ",
  "2821":"When the disciples were in the right position, as in Luke 24:41-43, they had &#151; even in the house &#151; more fish than they needed, so they offered a piece to the Lord. But here they were in a backslidden condition; thus, after fishing the whole night, they had &#151; even on the sea &#151; no fish, not even one piece! ",
  "2822":"Morning (v. 4) was not the right time for fishing, but when they obeyed the Lord's word and cast the net, they caught an abundance of fish. This surely was a miracle! It must have been that the Lord bade the fish to come into their net. <br><br>   In Luke 5:3-11 the Lord called Peter by a miracle in fishing. Here He recovered him to His call by another miracle in fishing. He is consistent in His purpose. ",
  "2823":"Or, had on his undergarment only. ",
  "2824":"I.e., a little over one hundred yards. ",
  "2825":"Here the Lord trained Peter to have faith in Him for his living. Peter and those with him had fished the entire night but had caught nothing. Then, according to the Lord's word they cast the net, and they caught an abundance of fish. But without these fish, and even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord prepared fish and even bread for the disciples. This too was a miracle! By this the Lord trained them to realize that without His leading, even if they should go to the sea, where the fish were, at night, the right time for fishing, they would catch nothing; but if they followed the Lord's leading, even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord could provide fish for them. Though they caught many fish according to the Lord's word, the Lord would not use these fish to feed them. This was a real lesson to Peter. For his living he needed to believe in the Lord, who calls things not being as being (Rom. 4:17). ",
  "2826":"This indicates the Lord's gracious care for the need of His called ones. ",
  "2827":"In the Lord's provision, bread represents the riches of the land, and fish represent the riches of the sea. ",
  "2828":"Here the Lord was restoring Peter's love toward Him. Peter did have a heart to love the Lord, but he was too confident in his own strength, his natural strength. His love for the Lord was precious, but his natural strength had to be denied and dealt with. The Lord allowed Peter to fail utterly in denying the Lord to His face three times (18:17, 25, 27), so that his natural strength and his self-confidence could be dealt with. Furthermore, Peter had just taken the lead to backslide from the Lord's call. His natural confidence in his love toward the Lord also must have been dealt with by this failure; yet he might have been somewhat disappointed. The Lord therefore came to restore his love toward Him, to charge him with the shepherding of His church, and to prepare him for his martyrdom so that he would not follow Him with any confidence in his natural strength. ",
  "2829":"The Greek word refers to a higher and nobler love. So for the first love in v. 16.",
  "2830":"The Greek word denotes an intimate love. So for the second love in v. 16, and for all occurrences of love in v. 17. ",
  "2831":"The fruit-bearing in ch. 15 is the outflow of the riches of the inner life. Here, to feed the lambs is to nourish them with the riches of the inner life. To feed others, we need to enjoy the riches of the Lord's divine life. This requires that we love Him. To believe in the Lord is to receive Him; to love the Lord is to enjoy Him. The Lord came as life and the life supply to us. We need to have faith in Him and love toward Him. This Gospel presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord. ",
  "2832":"Lit., little lambs. ",
  "2833":"Shepherding is for the flock (10:14, 16), which is the church (Acts 20:28); hence, it is related to God's building (Matt. 16:18). Later, Peter in his first Epistle indicated this, saying that growth by feeding on the pure milk of the word is for the building of God's house (1 Pet. 2:2-5) and charging the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-4). ",
  "2834":"Some MSS have, little sheep. So in v. 17. ",
  "2835":"Perhaps in questioning Peter three times, the Lord was reminding Peter of how he had denied Him three times. ",
  "2836":"The first know in this verse refers to the inward, subjective consciousness; the second refers to the outward, objective knowledge. See note 55 in ch. 8. ",
  "2837":"This may refer to his going fishing in v. 3. ",
  "2838":"Later, Peter referred to this (2 Pet. 1:14). What the Lord wanted here was to prepare Peter to follow Him unto death, not by anything of himself or according to his own will. ",
  "2839":"The Lord was there with the disciples. How then could He say \" ... until I come\"? Since He was there, He did not need to come. If He meant that He would leave them and later come back to them, how could He say to them, \"Follow Me\"? How could they follow Him? The answer to all these questions is related to His invisible presence. In His visible presence He would leave and come back later. But in His invisible presence He would be with them all the time. On one hand, He would be with them, and on the other hand, He would be away from them. So, on one hand, they could follow Him, and on the other hand, they would have to wait for His coming back. <br><br>   After His resurrection the Lord remained with the disciples for forty days (Acts 1:3-4) in order to train them to realize, practice, and live by His invisible presence. In v. 23 the Lord indicated that some of His believers would follow Him unto death, and that some would remain, i.e., live until He comes. ",
  "2840":"The span of what is covered in the last two chapters of this Gospel is broad. It begins with the discovery of the Lord's resurrection and ends with His coming back. Between these two events are all the matters related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord's resurrection &#151; that His Father is our Father and we are His brothers &#151; by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord's presence; having the Lord breathe the Holy Spirit into us, and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord, the natural strength having been dealt with; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; practicing the Lord's invisible presence, with some following the Lord even unto death to glorify God, not by self-will but according to His leading, and some living until He comes back. ",
  "2841":"This verse, together with 20:30-31, affirms that this Gospel is the record of selected things that serve the purpose of testifying to the matter of life and building. <br><br>   In note 20 para. 2, in Matt. 28 it is pointed out that the Lord's ascension is not mentioned in John or Matthew. The reason it is not mentioned is that today, after His resurrection, the Lord is still on the earth to be with His believers, and He will be with them until the end of this age, when He will be manifested in His visible glory (1 Pet. 1:7; 2 Thes. 1:7), that is, when He will come back to the earth in His visible presence (Matt. 16:27) to establish His visible kingdom. The Gospel of Matthew unveils and testifies that today, after His resurrection, the Lord, who is the spiritual King of the invisible kingdom of the heavens, is still on the earth in His Spirit of resurrection to be with the people of the kingdom of the heavens in His invisible presence; hence, Matthew does not mention His leaving the earth to ascend to the heavens. The Gospel of John reveals and testifies that as the Triune God, the Lord became flesh (1:14) to be the Lamb of God (1:29) and, after accomplishing His redemptive death for man, was transfigured in resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) and to enter into those who believe into Him to be their life for eternity, never to be separated from them; hence, it would have been inappropriate for John to mention His going away in ascension. <br><br>   Furthermore, the four Gospels are a full revelation of how the Triune God came to complete Christ, that is, to make Christ complete. The record in the Gospel of John is crucial regarding this matter. It shows us that the completing of Christ, who was anointed and commissioned by God to accomplish God's eternal will, was carried out by the Triune God becoming flesh in order to be united with man. First, through His death in the flesh He accomplished redemption for man, and then through resurrection He was transfigured to become the Spirit that He might enter into the believers (20:22) to be united with them, that they might be united with the Triune God (17:21). Thus He became Christ, the embodiment of God, and is able to take away men's sins and enter into men to be their life that they may become the sons of God to be His members, constituting His Body as the full expression of the Triune God. Thus, He is in them to be all their reality and to be with them invisibly until their bodies are redeemed and transfigured that they may enter into His visible presence to be completely united with Him and completely like Him, and to become the New Jerusalem, which is about to be completed, as the mutual habitation of the Triune God and His redeemed people for eternity!

  "2844":"See note 1 in Luke 1. ",
  "2845":"The resurrected Christ had become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), yet in resurrection He still did things through the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). ",
  "2846":"This was to train the disciples to practice and enjoy the Lord's invisible presence. See note 26 in John 20. ",
  "2847":"The resurrected Christ dwelt in the disciples, because He had breathed Himself as the Spirit into them on the day of His resurrection (John 20:22). His appearing does not mean that He had ever left them; it simply means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and enjoy His invisible presence all the time. ",
  "2848":"Forty days is a period of trial and testing (see note 2 in Matt. 4). ",
  "2849":"This proves that the kingdom of God would be the main subject of the apostles' preaching in their commission that was to come after Pentecost (8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). It is not a material kingdom visible to human sight but a kingdom of the divine life. It is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life. See notes 15 in Mark 1, 26 in Mark 4, and 43 in Luke 4. ",
  "2850":"Or, ate together. ",

  "2853":"This was accomplished in two sections: (1) all the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost (2:4); and (2) all the Gentile believers were baptized in the house of Cornelius (10:44-47; 11:15-17). In these two sections all genuine believers in Christ were baptized in the Holy Spirit into the one Body of Christ once for all universally (1 Cor. 12:13 and note 1). ",
  "2854":"The kingdom of Israel, for which the apostles and other devout Jews were looking, was a material kingdom, unlike God's kingdom of life, which is mentioned in v. 3 and which Christ is building up through the preaching of His gospel. See note 3. ",
  "2855":"This is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit (v. 5) for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father (v. 4). ",
  "2856":"Different from in you (John 14:17). The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection (John 20:22) to be the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) to them essentially. The same Holy Spirit would come upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power to them economically. See note 49 in Luke 24. ",
  "2857":"Lit., martyrs; those who bear a living testimony of the resurrected and ascended Christ in life, differing from preachers who merely preach doctrines in letters. In His incarnation Christ carried out His ministry on the earth by Himself, as recorded in the Gospels, to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God only in the Jewish land. In His ascension He would carry out His ministry in the heavens through these martyrs, in His resurrection life and with His ascension power and authority, as recorded in the Acts, to spread Himself as the development of the kingdom of God from Jerusalem, as a beginning, unto the uttermost part of the earth, as the consummation of His ministry in the New Testament. All the apostles and disciples in the Acts were His martyrs, His witnesses, of this kind (reference 8). See notes 11 in ch. 23 and 16 in ch. 26. ",
  "2858":"Lit., Men, Galileans. More dignified and solemn than simply \"Galileans.\" ",
  "2859":"Luke's Gospel ends with the Lord's ascending into heaven (Luke 24:51), and his Acts begins with it. His Gospel is a narrative of the ministry of the incarnated Jesus on earth; his Acts is a record of the continuing ministry of the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven, carried out through His believers on earth. In the Gospels His ministry on earth, carried out by Himself, only sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God into His believers, with no church being built up yet. In the Acts His ministry in heaven, carried out through His believers in His resurrection and ascension, spread Him as the development of the kingdom of God for the building up of the church (Matt. 16:18) throughout the entire world to constitute His Body, which is His fullness (Eph. 1:23) for His expression, and which is even the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19) for God's expression. ",
  "2860":"The Lord's ascension points to His coming back. Between these two events is the dispensation of grace that He, as the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), might apply His all-inclusive redemption to God's chosen people for their full salvation, that He might produce and build up the church as His Body for the establishing of the kingdom of God on earth. ",
  "2861":"Christ ascended into heaven from Mount Olivet (v. 12), being taken up by a cloud, in a way that was visible to human sight. He will return to the same mount (Zech. 14:4), coming on a cloud (Matt. 24:30), in the same visible way. ",
  "2862":"This vision of Christ's ascension into heaven strengthened the disciples' faith in Him and in what He had done for them through His death and resurrection. It broadened their view of God's heavenly economy, which had brought them into cooperation with Christ's ministry in the heavens for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy on the earth. The believers should have such a vision concerning Christ's ascension. ",
  "2863":"The disciples returned to Jerusalem to keep the Lord's words in Luke 24:49 and 1:4 of this book, that they might receive the Spirit of power economically as promised by the Father. They were all Galileans (v. 11). For them to stay in Jerusalem, especially under the Jewish leaders' threatening, meant that they were risking their lives. ",
  "2864":"According to Jewish tradition, a Sabbath day's journey equaled about three-quarters of a mile. ",
  "2865":"The Zealots, a Galilean sect, were excessively zealous in striving for their religion, and in particular for the Mosaic law. See note 4 in Matt. 10. ",
  "2866":"Or, son. ",
  "2867":"Before the Lord's death the disciples had no interest in praying for spiritual things (Luke 22:40, 45-46); rather, they contended among themselves as to which of them was considered to be greatest (Luke 22:24). But after the Lord's resurrection and ascension, their spiritual condition changed radically. They did not contend among themselves but were burdened to continue steadfastly with one accord in prayer, even before the day of Pentecost, when they would receive the outpoured Spirit of power economically (ch. 2). This is a strong sign and proof that they had received the indwelling Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord's resurrection (John 20:22). This is also evidence that they had been strengthened in God's New Testament economy by the vision of the Lord's ascension. ",
  "2868":"Or, with one mind. ",
  "2869":"The disciples might have prayed to be clothed with the Spirit of power, the promise of the Father, for which the Lord had charged them to remain in Jerusalem (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4), and might also have prayed for the commission given to them by the Lord in Luke 24:47-48 and 1:8 of this book to bear His testimony to the uttermost part of the earth. <br><br>   God wanted to pour out His Spirit for the carrying out of His New Testament economy and had promised to do it. Yet He still needed His chosen people to pray for this. As God in heaven, He needs men on earth to cooperate with Him for the carrying out of His plan. The one hundred twenty disciples' praying for ten days met this need of God's. ",
  "2870":"Here Mary is mentioned for the last time in the New Testament. ",
  "2871":"Before the Lord's death Peter often spoke nonsensically (Matt. 16:22-23; 17:24-26; 26:33-35). But now, after the Lord's resurrection, he could expound the Old Testament prophecies properly in their correct significance (vv. 16-20). This too is proof that the disciples, before they received the Spirit of power economically on the day of Pentecost, had received the Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord's resurrection. ",
  "2872":"More dignified and solemn than simply \"brothers.\" ",
  "2873":"Mentioned also in v. 25; referring to the ministry that bears the testimony of Jesus (v. 8). Though the apostles were twelve in number, their ministry was uniquely one &#151; this ministry, a corporate ministry in the principle of the Body of Christ. All the apostles carried out the same ministry to bear the testimony not of any religion, doctrine, or practice but uniquely of the incarnated, resurrected, and ascended Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of all.

  "2878":"The Lord's resurrection was the focus of the apostles' testimony. It points back to His incarnation, humanity, human living on the earth, and God-ordained death (2:23), and points forward to His ascension, ministry and administration in heaven, and coming back. Thus, the apostles' testimony of Jesus Christ, the Lord of all, was all-inclusive, as depicted in the whole book of Acts. They preached and ministered the all-inclusive Christ as He is revealed in the entire Scripture. ",
  "2879":"After the Lord's ascension and before the day of Pentecost the apostles were in a transitional period, as shown by the way they sought the Lord's guidance. They had received the indwelling Spirit on the day of the Lord's resurrection (John 20:22) and had been trained by the Lord for forty days before His ascension to practice and become accustomed to His invisible presence (v. 3). Yet it was still difficult for them to drop the old, traditional way of seeking God's leading by casting lots (Lev. 16:8; Josh. 14:2; 1 Sam. 14:41; Neh. 10:34; 11:1; Prov. 16:33). They were still not accustomed to the leading and guidance of the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:14), unlike the apostle Paul later, in 16:6-8. They were still in the initial stage of God's New Testament economy before the day of Pentecost. ",
  "2880":"Meaning fiftieth. It was the fiftieth day from the Lord's resurrection, there being seven weeks in between, counting from the second day (the first day of the week &#151; Luke 23:54--24:1) after the Passover on which the Lord was crucified (John 19:14). It was the fulfillment of the Feast of Weeks (Deut. 16:10), which was also called the Feast of Harvest (Exo. 23:16), and was counted from the day of the offering of a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, to the day after the seventh Sabbath (Lev. 23:10-11, 15-16). The sheaf of the firstfruits offered before God was a type of the resurrected Christ offered to God on the day of His resurrection (John 20:17), which was the day after the Sabbath (John 20:1). From that day to the day of Pentecost there were exactly fifty days (cf. 1:3). The Feast of Harvest typifies the enjoyment of the rich produce brought in by the resurrected Christ. This rich produce is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God, given by Him to His chosen people as the blessing of the gospel (Gal. 3:14) that they may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ (the very embodiment of the Triune God) as their good land. This signifies that the believers, by receiving the bountiful Spirit on the day of Pentecost, not only have entered into the good land but also have participated in the bountiful riches of the all-inclusive Christ (Eph. 3:8) in His resurrection and ascension, as God's full allotment in His New Testament economy. ",
  "2881":"In the Lord's resurrection the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples (John 20:22) for their spiritual being and living essentially. In the Lord's ascension the Spirit of ascension power, poured upon the disciples, is symbolized here by the wind and is for the disciples' ministry and move economically. The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission. ",
  "2882":"Gk. pleroo, to fill inwardly, as the wind filled the house. ",
  "2883":"A symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God's economical Spirit of power is mainly for speaking. He is the speaking Spirit. ",
  "2884":"Symbolizing burning power for purging and motivating in God's economical move. ",
  "2885":"The verb is singular, indicating that one tongue sat on each of them. ",
  "2886":"All modifies only filled in the first clause, not began to speak in the second clause. It cannot be used as evidence that all the disciples who were filled with the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues. ",
  "2887":"Gk. pletho (used also in 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; Luke 1:15, 41, 67), to fill outwardly. According to its usage in this book, pleroo denotes the filling of a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in v. 2, and pletho denotes the filling of persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in this verse. The disciples were filled ( pleroo) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit (13:52) for their Christian living, and were filled ( pletho) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the disciples (John 14:17; Rom. 8:11), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them (1:8; 2:17). Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit. Even Christ as a man experienced the same thing: He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20) for His being and living, and He was anointed with the Holy Spirit economically (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18) for His ministry and move. The essential Spirit was within Him and the economical Spirit was upon Him. <br><br>   The outward filling of the poured out Spirit was the ascended Head's baptizing of His Body into the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Jewish believers, the first part of His Body, were baptized; in the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way (10:44-47). By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), who is the application and realization of Himself. His baptizing His Body into the Spirit was His baptizing it into Himself. This was the accomplishment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit promised in 1:5 by Christ, the Head of the Body. ",

  "2905":"Calling on the name of the Lord is not a new practice that began with the New Testament. Rather, it began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, in Gen. 4:26. It was continued by Job (Job 12:4; 27:10), Abraham (Gen. 12:8; 13:4; 21:33), Isaac (Gen. 26:25), Moses and the children of Israel (Deut. 4:7), Samson (Judg. 15:18; 16:28), Samuel (1 Sam. 12:18; Psa. 99:6), David (2 Sam. 22:4, 7; 1 Chron. 16:8; 21:26; Psa. 14:4; 17:6; 18:3, 6; 31:17; 55:16; 86:5, 7; 105:1; 116:4, 13, 17; 118:5; 145:18), the psalmist Asaph (Psa. 80:18), the psalmist Heman (Psa. 88:9), Elijah (1 Kings 18:24), Isaiah (Isa. 12:4), Jeremiah (Lam. 3:55, 57), and others (Psa. 99:6), all of whom practiced this in the Old Testament age. Isaiah charged the seekers of God to call upon Him (Isa. 55:6). Even the Gentiles knew that the prophets of Israel had the habit of calling on the name of God (Jonah 1:6; 2 Kings 5:11). The Gentile raised up by God from the north also called upon His name (Isa. 41:25). It is God's commandment (Psa. 50:15; Jer. 29:12) and desire (Psa. 91:15; Zeph. 3:9; Zech. 13:9) that His people call on Him. This is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God's salvation (Isa. 12:3-4) and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God (Job 27:10), that is, to enjoy Him. Hence, God's people must call upon Him daily (Psa. 88:9). Such a jubilant practice was prophesied by Joel (Joel 2:32) concerning the New Testament jubilee. <br><br>   In the New Testament, calling on the name of the Lord was first mentioned by Peter, here, on the day of Pentecost, as the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy. This fulfillment is related to God's outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit economically upon His chosen people that they may participate in His New Testament jubilee. Joel's prophecy and its fulfillment concerning God's New Testament jubilee have two aspects: on God's side, He poured out His Spirit in the ascension of the resurrected Christ; on our side, we call on the name of the ascended Lord, who has accomplished all, attained unto all, and obtained all. Calling on the Lord's name is vitally necessary in order for us, the believers in Christ, to participate in and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ with all He has accomplished, attained, and obtained (1 Cor. 1:2). It is a major practice in God's New Testament economy that enables us to enjoy the processed Triune God for our full salvation (Rom. 10:10-13). The early believers practiced this everywhere (1 Cor. 1:2), and to the unbelievers, especially the persecutors, it became a popular sign of Christ's believers (9:14, 21). When Stephen suffered persecution, he practiced this (7:59), and his practice surely impressed Saul, one of his persecutors (7:58-60; 22:20). Later, the unbelieving Saul persecuted the callers (9:14, 21) by taking their calling as a sign. Immediately after Saul was caught by the Lord, Ananias, who brought Saul into the fellowship of the Body of Christ, charged him to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord, to show others that he too had become such a caller. By his word to Timothy in 2 Tim. 2:22, Paul indicated that in the early days all the Lord's seekers practiced such calling. Undoubtedly, he was one who practiced this, since he charged his young co-worker Timothy to do this that Timothy might enjoy the Lord as he did. <br><br>   The Greek word for call on is composed of on and call (by name); thus, it is to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did (7:59-60). ",
  "2906":"The name denotes the person. Jesus is the Lord's name, and the Spirit is His person. When we call, \"Lord Jesus,\" we receive the Spirit. ",
  "2907":"This is the conclusion of the quotation of Joel's prophecy, which began in v. 17, indicating that the issue of God's pouring out of His Spirit upon all flesh is their salvation through calling on the name of the Lord. God's outpouring of His Spirit is the applying of the Lord's salvation to His chosen people. To be saved is to receive this Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel in God's New Testament economy (Gal. 3:2, 5, 14). This Spirit is the Lord Himself as the breath (John 20:22) and the living water (John 4:10, 14) to us. To breathe Him in as our breath and drink Him as our living water, we need to call on Him. Lamentations 3:55-56 indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing, and Isa. 12:3-4 indicates that our calling on the Lord is our drinking. After we believe in the Lord, we need to call on Him that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches (Rom. 10:12-13). When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, breathe Him in, and drink Him, we enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God. The Lord connected such worship (John 4:24) to the drinking of the living water given by Him (John 4:14). ",

In his Gospel, Luke presented to his readers this man, from His conception, through His birth, youth, life on earth, death, and resurrection, to His ascension.

In 10:40-41 he said the same thing again but added, \"He rose from the dead.\" Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead (Rom. 8:11); considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This proves His dual status &#151; human and divine. ",
  "2916":"The Lord is both God and resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Since He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to hold Him.

The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually His receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself. Christ was conceived of the Spirit essentially for His existence in humanity (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20) and was anointed with the Spirit economically for His ministry among men (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18). After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again that He might pour Himself out upon His Body to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth for the accomplishing of God's New Testament economy. ",

And as God's sent and anointed One, He was Christ from the time that He was born (Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; John 1:41; Matt. 16:16). But as such a One, He was also officially made the very Christ of God in His ascension. <br><br>   The Lord was made Lord, the Lord of all, to possess all; and He was made Christ, God's Anointed (Heb. 1:9), to carry out God's commission.

To be baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, or into the name of the Lord Jesus, is to be baptized into a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. See notes 16 in ch. 8 and 19 in Matt. 28. <br><br>   (3) Epi, upon, or on (v. 38). To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for. It stands for all that the person of Jesus Christ is and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the belief (the faith) of God's New Testament economy. It is on this ground that the believers in Christ are baptized. ",

  "2944":"Forgiveness of sins is based on the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished through His death (10:43; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:3); it is the initial and basic blessing of God's full salvation. Based on it the blessing of God's full salvation goes forward and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "2945":"Not any gift distributed by the Spirit, such as is mentioned in Rom. 12:6, 1 Cor. 12:4, and 1 Pet. 4:10, but the gift that is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in Rom. 12, 1 Cor. 12, and 1 Pet. 4. Those gifts are the abilities and capacities for the service of God, and they come from this unique gift, the Holy Spirit. ",
  "2946":"The all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God in His New Testament economy, both essential for life and economical for power, given to the believers at the time of their believing in Christ (Eph. 1:13; Gal. 3:2), as the all-inclusive blessing of God's full gospel (Gal. 3:14) that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14). <br><br>   The apostles preached and ministered Christ, but when their hearers repented and believed in Him, they received this wonderful Spirit of the Triune God. This implies that this Spirit is just the resurrected and ascended Christ Himself. The receiving of the Spirit here is both essential and economical, in a general and all-inclusive sense, differing from the receiving of the Spirit in 8:15-17 and 19:2-6, which is particularly the receiving of the Spirit in His falling upon the believers economically.

  "2952":"Be is active, and saved is passive; hence, be saved is in the active-passive voice. Salvation is to be carried out by God, but man needs to be active to receive what God intends to do. At the time of Pentecost, everything concerning God's full salvation had been prepared, and the Holy Spirit was poured out as the application and full blessing of God's salvation, ready for man to receive. In this matter God is waiting for man, and man needs to take the initiative. Man, be saved! ",
  "2953":"At the conclusion of his message Peter did not say, \"Be saved from God's condemnation,\" or \"from eternal perdition,\" but, \"Be saved from this crooked generation.\" The crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in that age, who rejected God's Christ (v. 36) and were considered by God as the \"present evil age\" (Gal. 1:4). For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age required a genuine repentance concerning their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God. This indicates that they needed to turn to God not only from their sins but also from their generation, their Jewish society, including their Jewish religion. The result of such a salvation was not their entering into heaven but their entering into a new generation &#151; the church. Thus, the saved ones were separated from the Jewish society into the church. Being saved in this way implies being saved from God's condemnation and eternal perdition unto God's eternal purpose and His pleasure (Eph. 3:11; 1:9). ",

  "2955":"The first group of believers produced through the apostles' preaching and ministering of Christ on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in four things: teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers. Teaching is the unveiling of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church; fellowship is the communion and communication between the believers in their communion and communication with God the Father and Christ the Son; breaking of bread is the remembrance of the Lord in His accomplishing of God's full redemption; and prayer is cooperation with the Lord in heaven for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy on earth. The first two, teaching and fellowship, conjoined by and to be one group, are of the apostles, but breaking of bread and prayers are not, indicating that besides the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, the believers in Christ should not have any other teaching and fellowship. In God's New Testament economy there is only one category of teaching revealed and recognized by God &#151; the teaching of the apostles &#151; and only one category of fellowship that is of God and is acceptable to Him &#151; the fellowship of the apostles, which is with the Father and the Son, Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3 and note 3), and which is the unique fellowship of the unique church, the Body of Christ. The last two, the breaking of bread and prayer, also conjoined by and to be another group, are practices of the believers in their Christian life and are not related directly to God's economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not of the apostles, who brought in God's New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ. ",
  "2956":"Wonders and signs are not part of God's central testimony, which is the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ; neither are they part of His full salvation. They are only evidences that what the apostles preached and ministered and the way they acted were absolutely of God, not of man (Heb. 2:3-4). ",
  "2957":"Also in 4:32. Having all things common was not a sign of love but of Christ's dynamic salvation, which saved the believers from greediness and selfishness. It was practiced for only a short time at the initiation of God's New Testament economy; it did not continue for the long run as a practice of legality (see note 4 in ch. 5) in the church life during Paul's ministry, as proved by his words in 2 Cor. 9 and other places. ",
  "2958":"This too was an evidence of the Lord's dynamic salvation, which caused the believers to overcome earthly possessions, which occupy, possess, and usurp all fallen mankind (Matt. 19:21-24; Luke 12:13-19, 33-34; 14:33; 16:13-14; 1 Tim. 6:17). ",
  "2959":"In the initiation of God's New Testament economy, the early believers and even the first group of apostles were not clear that God had forsaken Judaism with its practices and facilities, including the temple (see Matt. 23:38 &#151; \"your house,\" referring to the God-forsaken temple). Hence, according to their tradition and habit, they still went to the temple for their New Testament meeting. ",
  "2960":"The early believers remembered the Lord by breaking bread daily in their houses; this showed their love and enthusiasm toward the Lord. ",
  "2961":"Or, at home; in contrast to in the temple. Meeting in homes as the Christian way of meeting together is fitting to God's New Testament economy. This way differs from the Judaic way of meeting in the synagogues (6:9). It became a continual and general practice in the churches (cf. Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2). ",
  "2962":"Or, singleness; describing the heart's being simple, single, and plain, having one love and desire and one goal in seeking after the Lord. ",

  "2964":"This indicates that from the very beginning of their Christian life the early believers were brought into the corporate church life; they did not live individualistically as Christians separated from one another. ",
  "2965":"See note 46 in ch. 2. It was not only the early believers who were not clear concerning God's New Testament economy in relation to the Judaic temple; even the early apostles did not have a clear vision concerning God's abandoning of the Judaic things. Hence, even after God poured out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost to initiate a new dispensation, they still would not separate themselves from the Judaic temple. At the initial stage God tolerated their ignorance in this matter. But this led to a mixture of the church with Judaism, which was not condemned by the early church in Jerusalem (cf. 21:20-26). Eventually, the temple was destroyed by Titus with his Roman army in A.D. 70, as prophesied by the Lord in Matt. 23:38 and 24:2. That destruction cleared up the religious mixture. ",

The Roman Church is filled with gold but not with the person of Christ. She is rich in gold but poor in Christ. ",

It seems that Peter's word skips over the church age and goes directly from the time of Pentecost to the millennium. This may indicate that Peter did not have a clear vision concerning the church age in God's New Testament economy. The entire New Testament reveals that before the seasons of refreshing, the church occupies a considerable period of time in God's dispensation. ",

Now, in this book, the same Sanhedrin, with the same constituents, began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry (5:21; 6:12; 22:30). This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God's enemy, Satan the devil, and was being used by him in his attempt to frustrate and even destroy God's move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, that is, to bring His kingdom to the earth by establishing and building up the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ.

  "2999":"This word was spoken by the Lord in Matt. 21:42 (see note 1 there), quoted from Psa. 118:22. It unveiled the Jewish leaders' rejection of Him and God's honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on the earth. By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle (1 Pet. 2:4-7). Peter's quoting of this word indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the sinners' salvation but also as the stone for God's building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners, and it is in His unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God (Phil. 2:9-10), that sinners must be saved (v. 12) not only from sin (Matt. 1:21) but also to participate in God's building (1 Pet. 2:5).

  "3032":"Or, Prince; the same Greek word as for Author in 3:15. See note 1 there. God exalted the man Jesus, who had been rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader, the Prince, the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world (Rev. 1:5; 19:16), and the Savior to save God's chosen people. Leader is related to His authority, and Savior to His salvation. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation (cf. 17:26-27; John 17:2). ",
  "3033":"To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads God's chosen people to repent, and His salvation, which is based on His redemption, affords them forgiveness of sins. ",

  "3049":"To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and strengthened.

The opposing Jews twisted the believers' words, just as in Matt. 27:40, when they crucified the Lord, they twisted the word that the Lord spoke in John 2:19. Undoubtedly, the Jews' opposition was instigated by Satan to frustrate God's New Testament economy. But the ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions. God's New Testament economy is to have a new dispensation absolutely separated from Judaism. This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations, and it stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord's ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce at the time of the apostles' ministry in this book, during which the Lord's New Testament move was passing through a transitional period. According to Luke's narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully, because of the remaining influence of their Judaic background and the entangling opposition from their Jewish kinsmen. This problem returned to trouble them again and again in this book (11:1-3; 15:1-5; 21:18-26). Even the apostle Paul was in danger of being brought back to the Judaic practices in his last visit to Jerusalem (21:20-26). See notes 10 in James 2 and 11 in James 1. ",
  "3061":"Signifying a heavenly appearance. Stephen was a man on earth, but he bore a heavenly appearance while being persecuted. ",

It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham and called him. His glory was a great attraction to him. It separated (sanctified) him from the world unto God (Exo. 29:43) and was a great encouragement and strength that enabled him to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4). In the same principle, God calls the New Testament believers by His invisible glory (2 Pet. 1:3). ",

  "3069":"Compare with seventy in Gen. 46:27 and Exo. 1:5. Stephen quoted this number from the Septuagint, which mentions five additional descendants of Joseph in Gen. 46:20. Hence, the number he mentioned of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt was seventy-five instead of seventy. ",
  "3070":"Or, different (in character). Not only another king, but a king of different character. ",
  "3071":"From v. 20 through v. 44 Stephen purposely gave a long narration in the most positive way concerning Moses. He did this to vindicate himself before his opposers, who had accused him of blaspheming Moses (6:11). ",
  "3072":"Lit., fair to God. A Hebraism denoting fair in the sight of God; hence, exceedingly fair. ",

  "3088":"Implying that God would abandon the material temple of the Old Testament and initiate a new dispensation, that His people might worship Him in the spirit (John 4:24), in which is God's spiritual habitation, the church (Eph. 2:22). ",
  "3089":"This quotation from Isa. 66:1-2 indicates that the Lord was seeking a spiritual habitation in man's spirit. This is proved by the unquoted part of Isa. 66:2 that says, \"But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit.\" ",
  "3090":"A very strong expression. ",
  "3091":"Since Stephen was full of the Spirit (v. 55) and was one with the Lord the Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), to oppose him was to oppose the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Lord indicated to Saul, one of Stephen's persecutors (v. 58; 8:1), that he was persecuting Him (9:4). ",
  "3092":"The Greek word is a noun; the verb form of the same word is used in Gal. 3:19 and is rendered ordained there. The law of God was ordained through angels and became ordinances of angels. ",
  "3093":"See note 33 in ch. 5. ",
  "3094":"See note 3 in ch. 6. ",
  "3095":"A great vindication and encouragement to the persecuted one. ",
  "3096":"The Lord in ascension is usually referred to as sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64; Heb. 1:3, 13). But Stephen saw Him standing there. This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one. ",
  "3097":"The earth rejected Stephen and was closed to him, but the heavens opened up to him, indicating that the heavens were with him and for him. ",
  "3098":"Saul, who later became an apostle (13:9), helped the persecutors in their slaying of Stephen. ",
  "3099":"See note 21 in ch. 2. ",
  "3100":"Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way that his Lord, whom he loved and lived, had prayed for His (Luke 23:34). ",
  "3101":"This was the first church established in a locality (see note 11 in ch. 5) within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem. It was a local church in its locality, as indicated by the Lord in Matt. 18:17. It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matt. 16:18, but only a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The record concerning this matter (the establishing of the church in its locality) is consistent throughout the New Testament (13:1; 14:23; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11). ",
  "3102":"It was sovereign of God that the scattering of the believers from Jerusalem to other localities through the persecution should carry out the spreading of the gospel for the fulfillment of the Lord's word in 1:8 (11:19). ",
  "3103":"This was not the Philip among the apostles (1:13) but the Philip among the seven appointed by the apostles to serve tables (6:5). Through his ministry in preaching the gospel, as recorded in this chapter, he was manifested to be an evangelist (21:8). ",
  "3104":"This was a further step in the Lord's evangelistic move. By this He spread Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God from the racially pure Jews to the racially mixed Samaritans for the fulfillment of His prophecy in 1:8. ",
  "3105":"Philip announced the kingdom of God as the gospel just as the Lord had done (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:43 and note 1). ",
  "3106":"See note 43 in ch. 2. ",
  "3107":"See note 38 par. 2, in ch. 2. ",
  "3108":"This does not mean that the believers in Samaria did not receive the Holy Spirit within them essentially when they believed in the Lord. According to the teaching of the New Testament in Eph. 1:13 and Gal. 3:2, they must have received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed for their regeneration (John 3:6, 36). But they had not yet received the Spirit economically to identify them with the Body of Christ. The reason the Holy Spirit did not fall upon them outwardly and economically was so that the apostles, through whom the practical establishing of the church had been initiated in Jerusalem, might come to bring them into identification with the Body of Christ. This case is different from that of the ones in the house of Cornelius, who, when they believed in the Lord, received the Holy Spirit both essentially within them for regeneration and economically upon them for baptism into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13) and identification with the Body of Christ. That was because the gospel was preached then directly by Peter, who played the main role in the initiation of the practical establishing of the church. ",
  "3109":"Not in the name but into the name. The name denotes the person. To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the person of the Lord, to be identified with the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, to be put into an organic union with the living Lord. See notes 38 in ch. 2 and 19 in Matt. 28. <br><br>   In Matt. 28:19 the Lord charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. But later, in practice, the believers were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, here and in 19:5, and into Christ, in Rom. 6:3 and Gal. 3:27. This indicates that (1) to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, because the Lord Jesus is the Triune God, the embodiment of God Himself (Col. 2:9), and (2) to be baptized into the name of the Triune God or into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the person of Christ. ",
  "3110":"Since the Samaritan believers had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, that is, into the Lord Himself, they surely must have received the Spirit of life essentially within them that they might be not only born of the Lord but also joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), although they had not received the Spirit of power outwardly and economically. ",
  "3111":"See note 14 in 1 Tim. 4. Peter and John were sent to Samaria not only to confirm the preaching of the gospel by Philip, one of the seven appointed to serve tables, but also to bring the church in Samaria, composed of Samaritans, with whom the Jews had no dealings, into identification with the Body of Christ by laying their hands on them. The Holy Spirit honored this laying on of hands and fell upon the Samaritans, signifying their identification with the Body of Christ. In this way the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit economically in addition to their having received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed in the Lord Jesus. ",
  "3112":"See notes 4 and 17 in ch. 2. ",
  "3113":"Some MSS add, Holy. ",
  "3114":"This indicates that Simon's practice of magic, which amazed people, was for money. ",
  "3115":"Not eternal perdition but a punishment, as in Heb. 10:39 (see note 2 there) and Matt. 7:13 (see note 3 there). Simon had believed in the gospel and had been baptized (v. 13); hence, he must have experienced salvation in its initial stage, but he had not been saved from his wicked thought and act concerning money. Therefore, he needed to repent of this wickedness that he might receive the Lord's forgiveness; otherwise, he would go with his silver into punishment. ",
  "3116":"The gift of God (v. 20). ",
  "3117":"To testify the word of the Lord is to witness according to personal experience of the Lord, and to speak the word of the Lord is to preach and teach according to the revelation of the Lord. See note 40 in ch. 2. ",
  "3118":"Ethiopia is Cush (Isa. 18:1), the land of the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham (Gen. 10:6). The gospel had spread from the racially pure Jews to the racially mixed Samaritans through Philip and Peter and John (vv. 5-25). Now the angel of the Lord directed Philip to contact an utter Gentile from Ethiopia. Through this the gospel spread southward to Africa. ",
  "3119":"Proving that the Ethiopian eunuch was seeking God (cf. 17:26-27). ",
  "3120":"The mentioning of the Spirit here, as in v. 39; 10:19; 13:2; and 16:6-7, indicates that in this book the Lord's move in spreading His kingdom through the preaching of the gospel was by the Spirit's leading and directing, not by man's device and schedule. Hence, this move was not the act of man but the act of the Spirit. This is altogether different from today's degraded practice. ",
  "3121":"Referring to Christ the Redeemer. It must have been sovereignly of the Spirit's leading that the eunuch opened to the passage concerning Christ as the sinners' redeeming Lamb, a passage good for gospel preaching. ",
  "3122":"This indicates that Philip preached water baptism to the eunuch. In this gospel case, water baptism was particularly emphasized, but no mention was made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers' identification with Christ's death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:12), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism produces the reality of the believers' union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers' affirmation of the Spirit's reality. Both are needed (cf. 10:47), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized in the cloud (signifying the Spirit) and in the sea (signifying water) &#151; 1 Cor. 10:2. See notes 8 in Mark 1, 5 in John 3, and 6 in 1 John 5. ",
  "3123":"Many ancient MSS omit this verse. ",
  "3124":"Denoting the Lord's full salvation in God's New Testament economy. It is the way God dispenses Himself into the believers through Christ's redemption and the Spirit's anointing; it is the way the believers partake of God and enjoy God; it is the way the believers worship God in their spirit by enjoying Him and follow the persecuted Jesus by being one with Him; and it is the way the believers are brought into the church and built up into the Body of Christ to bear the testimony of Jesus (cf. notes 2 15 and 21 in 2 Pet. 2). ",
  "3125":"A corporate \"Me,\" comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers. Saul did not have this revelation. He thought that he was persecuting Stephen and other Jesus-followers, who were in the Way, which he considered heresy (24:14). He did not know that when he persecuted these he persecuted Jesus, for they were one with Him by being united to Him through their faith in Him. He considered that he was persecuting people on earth, never thinking that he touched anyone in heaven. To his great surprise a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom he was persecuting and that His name was Jesus. To him this was a unique revelation in the universe! By this he began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person &#151; the wonderful \"Me.\" This must have impressed and affected him for his future ministry concerning Christ and the church as the great mystery of God (Eph. 5:32) and laid a solid foundation for his unique ministry. ",
  "3126":"Saul called Him \"Lord,\" even without knowing Him (cf. Rom. 10:13). ",
  "3127":"The Lord would not directly tell Saul immediately after his conversion what He wanted him to do. This was because he needed a member of His Body to initiate him into identification with the Body, for he had been saved and brought to the Lord directly by Him, not indirectly through any channel. Unless a member of His Body had been sent by the Lord to contact him, it would have been difficult for any member of the Body to receive Saul (cf. v. 26). This is related to Saul's knowledge concerning the Body of Christ and to his ministry for the Body of Christ later (Col. 1:24). ",
  "3128":"This was the Lord's dealing with Saul. Before this, Saul would have considered himself marvelously knowledgeable, as one who knew all things concerning man and God. Now the Lord made him blind so that he could see nothing until the Lord opened his eyes, especially his inner eyes, and commissioned him to open the eyes of others (26:18). ",
  "3129":"The Lord sent Ananias, one member of His Body, to Saul that Saul might be initiated into identification with the Body of Christ. This too must have impressed Saul with the importance of the Body of Christ, helping him to realize that a saved believer needs the members of the Body of Christ. ",
  "3130":"Or, regain. The blinded Saul's receiving of sight was his being saved in full. This was exceedingly important to him. It was especially important that his inner eyes were opened to see the things of God concerning His mysteries and His economy. ",
  "3131":"Indicating that in the early days calling upon the Lord's name was a sign of the Lord's followers (1 Cor. 1:2). This calling must have been audible, so that others could hear; thus it became a sign. ",
  "3132":"Because of this, Saul had been set apart from his mother's womb and called by the Lord (Gal. 1:15). The Lord is sovereign and able, according to His choosing in eternity, to make the most fierce among His persecutors a vessel, a leading apostle, to carry out His commission in preaching the gospel and taking the way he had opposed and persecuted. Eventually, the opposing Saul became, in his victorious ministry of the gospel, Christ's vanquished captive in the triumphal procession celebrating Christ's victory over all His enemies (2 Cor. 2:14 and notes 1 and 2). The Lord's perfecting of His chosen vessels in such a way is excellent and glorious. ",
  "3133":"Saul's case was a particular one also because, as the most significant persecutor, he had been saved directly by the Lord from heaven while on his way to persecute the believers. Hence, like the Samaritan believers (8:14-17 and note 17) and the twelve disciples in Ephesus (19:1-7), he needed a member of the Body of Christ to initiate him into identification with the Body of Christ by the laying on of hands. ",
  "3134":"Filled outwardly (see note 4 in ch. 2). According to the principle of salvation in God's New Testament economy, Saul must have received the Holy Spirit of life essentially at the time of his conversion, prior to Ananias's coming and laying his hands on him. Before Ananias came, Saul was praying to the Lord (v. 11), indicating that he had believed in the Lord and was calling on Him (cf. Rom. 10:13-14) like those believers whom he had ravaged and was going to arrest (vv. 21, 14). But since he had not been saved through any member of the Body of Christ, the Holy Spirit did not fall upon him economically (2:17 and note 2) until Ananias came as the representative of the Body to identify him with the Body of Christ. ",
  "3135":"See note 12. ",
  "3136":"By water (see notes 36 in ch. 8 and 16 in Mark 16). ",
  "3137":"See note 2 in James 2. ",
  "3138":"Since at that time the church had spread only to the provinces of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and since the word whole covers all the places where the church existed, church in singular is used here in the universal sense, although there must have been churches in the local sense in a number of the cities of these three provinces. ",
  "3139":"They had peace inwardly, although there was persecution outwardly. The church is afraid not of being persecuted outwardly but of not having peace inwardly, for only when there is peace can there be the building up. ",
  "3140":"The building up proceeded after the establishing of the church. ",
  "3141":"Not in the fear of men, although there were persecutions, but in the fear of the Lord lest the church offend the Lord by being put down or even subdued by the persecution, and lest she offend Him in other things. ",
  "3142":"Indicating that the church was suffering affliction through the persecutions, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "3143":"A town about eleven miles southeast of Joppa, called Lod in the Old Testament (1 Chron. 8:12; Ezra 2:33). ",
  "3144":"I.e., put in order. ",
  "3145":"Meaning gazelle. ",
  "3146":"Lit., her. ",
  "3147":"Lit., in it. ",
  "3148":"A shirt-like undergarment. ",
  "3149":"Here the Lord took a further step in His evangelistic work. By this He reached another utter Gentile, a man of Italy of the Roman Empire in Europe. Thus the door of the gospel was opened to all the Gentiles. It was difficult for the Jewish apostles and disciples, with their Jewish background and habit, to come near the Gentiles (v. 28). Hence, this was an extraordinary move, needing the participation of an angel of God (v. 3), just as when Philip approached the Ethiopian, a man from Africa, in 8:26. In the two cases the Spirit spoke to Philip and to Peter, respectively, in a particular way (8:29; 10:19). ",
  "3150":"One of ten divisions of an ancient Roman legion. It was composed of 600 men. ",
  "3151":"Like the Ethiopian eunuch, Cornelius, the Roman centurion, was seeking God, as Paul mentioned in 17:27. ",
  "3152":"See note 10. ",
  "3153":"I.e., 3:00 p.m. (so also in v. 30). ",
  "3154":"Though Cornelius was part of fallen mankind, sinful and condemned before God like all others, God accepted his prayers and his alms, whereas He rejected Cain's (Gen. 4:3, 5). This must have been because of the fact that God, based on Christ's eternal redemption and in view of Cornelius's believing in Christ in the ensuing days, forgave him (v. 43) according to His foreknowledge. ",
  "3155":"Cornelius received a vision in prayer (v. 30), and Peter also received a vision (vv. 17, 19) in prayer, through which God's plan and move were carried out. Man's prayer is needed as a means of cooperating with God's move. ",
  "3156":"I.e., 12:00 noon (cf. Psa. 55:17). ",
  "3157":"Signifying seeking after the things of God (Matt. 5:6). God fills the hungry with good things (Luke 1:53). ",
  "3158":"A word usually rendered taste. ",
  "3159":"The Greek word means being put out of its place, referring to a state in which a man senses that he passes out of himself and from which he comes to himself (note 11 in ch. 12), as in a dream but without sleep. It differs from a vision, as in vv. 3, 17, and 19, in which definite objects are visible to human eyes. However, in this ecstasy, or trance, Peter saw a vision (11:5). ",
  "3160":"Indicating that the Lord's evangelistic move on earth is under His administration on the throne in heaven (cf. Heb. 8:1; Acts 7:56). All the apostles and evangelists were and still are carrying out the heavenly commission on earth for the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom of God. ",
  "3161":"The vessel that was like a great sheet symbolizes the gospel spreading to the four corners of the inhabited earth to collect all kinds of unclean (sinful) people (Luke 13:29). ",
  "3162":"Symbolizing men of all kinds (vv. 15, 28, and notes). ",
  "3163":"In this sign, to eat is to associate with people (v. 28). ",
  "3164":"As taught in Lev. 11. Circumcision, Sabbath keeping, and a particular diet are the three strongest ordinances according to the law of Moses that make the Jews distinct and separate from the Gentiles, whom the Jews consider unclean. All these scriptural ordinances of the Old Testament dispensation became an obstacle to the spreading of the gospel to the Gentiles according to God's New Testament dispensation (15:1; Col. 2:16). ",
  "3165":"Referring to people whom God has cleansed through the redeeming blood of Christ (Rev. 1:5) and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5; Acts 15:9). ",
  "3166":"See note 10. ",
  "3167":"This indicates that Cornelius's sending of the three men was the Spirit's move and act through him even before his conversion. ",
  "3168":"In this strategic case Peter did not act individualistically but with some of the brothers, in the principle of the Body of Christ, that they might bear witness to the way in which God dealt with the Gentiles, that is, preaching the gospel to them through Peter's breaking of the Jewish tradition and habit (11:12). ",
  "3169":"This indicates that eventually Peter understood the significance of the vision he had seen in the trance (vv. 11, 17, 19), that is, that the animals in the great sheet represented men. ",
  "3170":"Those who fear God and work righteousness in every nation are still a part of fallen mankind. God accepts them in view of the redemption of Christ (see note 4). Outside of Christ, no fallen man is justified by his works (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16). ",
  "3171":"Referring to men (1 Tim. 2:4), not only Jews but also Gentiles. ",
  "3172":"Lit., the word which has taken place. The Greek word for word here denotes instant words. ",
  "3173":"See note 24 in ch. 2. ",
  "3174":"Lit., to become visible. ",
  "3175":"See note 24 in ch. 2. ",
  "3176":"At His coming back, before the millennium, the resurrected Christ will judge the living on His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46). This is related to His second coming (2 Tim. 4:1). After the millennium He will judge the dead on the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). See note 31 in ch. 17. That will be the final clearance of the defiled old creation. ",
  "3177":"This proves that even though Cornelius feared God and worked righteousness and his prayers and alms had been accepted by God, he still needed God's forgiveness of his sins through his believing into Christ, the Redeemer (see notes 4 and 35). ",
  "3178":"Outwardly and economically (see note 8 in ch. 1). In the case of the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit's entering into the believers essentially for life and falling upon them economically for power occurred simultaneously when they believed in the Lord. However, only His falling upon them economically is noted here, because it was outward and could be realized by others through their speaking in tongues and magnifying God (v. 46). His entering into them occurred silently and invisibly. They received both aspects of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head, without any mediatorial channel, before they were baptized in water by other members of the Body of Christ. This indicates emphatically that the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom of God to the Gentiles was of the Lord, and that the Head of the Body baptized the Gentile believers into His Body directly, without the laying on of hands of any member of His Body, in contrast to the cases of the Samaritan believers and Saul of Tarsus (8:17; 9:17). ",
  "3179":"This included their believing into the Lord (v. 43; John 5:24; Rom. 10:14; Eph. 1:13). ",
  "3180":"The Holy Spirit Himself, not anything of the Holy Spirit given to the believers as a gift (see note 38 in ch. 2). ",
  "3181":"By God from the all-inclusive, resurrected, and ascended Christ (see note 17 in ch. 2). ",
  "3182":"Speaking in tongues was not the unique issue of receiving the Holy Spirit economically, because in this case the magnifying, that is, the praising, of God was also one of its issues, as was prophesying in the case of the twelve believers in Ephesus (19:6). Hence, speaking in tongues is not the only evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit economically; neither is it the necessary evidence, because there is at least one case of the receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, the case of the Samaritan believers (8:15-17), which does not mention speaking in tongues. In the case of Saul of Tarsus (9:17) concerning this matter, there again is no mention of speaking in tongues, although he told us later, in 1 Cor. 14:18, that he spoke in tongues. ",
  "3183":"The same expression as in Luke 1:46. ",
  "3184":"Like the early apostles and the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost (2:4), the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius received the Holy Spirit economically directly from the ascended Head. Only these two instances in the New Testament are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit (1:5; 11:15-16). By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers, both Jewish and Gentile, once for all into His one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). Hence, the baptism in the Spirit is an accomplished fact carried out by Christ in His ascension, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. None of the other cases &#151; the Samaritan believers in ch. 8, Saul of Tarsus in ch. 9, and the twelve Ephesian believers in ch. 19 &#151; are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the revelation of the New Testament. These other cases were merely the believers' experiences of the once-for-all-accomplished baptism in the Holy Spirit. <br><br>   In this book, concerning the believers' receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, that is, the Holy Spirit's falling upon them, only five cases are mentioned. Two of them are for the accomplishing of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. These are the instances that occurred on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. The other three &#151; the cases of the Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the twelve believers in Ephesus &#151; are considered extraordinary, in that some members of the Body of Christ were needed to identify those believers with the Body by the laying on of hands. Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand (2:41), the five thousand (4:4), the Ethiopian eunuch (8:36, 38-39a), the many who believed in Antioch (11:20-21, 24), the many instances in chs. 13 and 14 under Paul's preaching ministry, Lydia in Philippi (16:14-15), the jailer in Philippi (16:33), the believers in Thessalonica (17:4), the believers in Berea (17:10-12), the believers in Athens (17:34), the ruler of the synagogue and many other believers in Corinth (18:8), and the believers in Ephesus (19:18-19), there is no mention of the believers' receiving of the Holy Spirit economically &#151; the Holy Spirit's falling upon the believers &#151; because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ in a normal way through their believing and had no particular need for a member of the Body of Christ to bring them into identification with the Body by the laying on of hands. According to the principle of God's New Testament economy, they all must have received the Holy Spirit essentially for life and economically for power in a normal way through their believing into Christ. ",
  "3185":"See note 36 in ch. 8. ",
  "3186":"Cf. into the name in 8:16. ",
  "3187":"The name denotes the person (see note 19 in Matt. 28). To be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized into the person of Christ (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27), which is also to be baptized into the sphere of His person (see note 38 in ch. 2). ",
  "3188":"Circumcision was an outward ordinance inherited by the Jews from their forefathers, beginning from Abraham (Gen. 17:9-14). It made them distinct and separate from the Gentiles. It became a dead, traditional formality, a mere mark on the flesh without any spiritual significance, and became a great obstacle to the spread of God's gospel according to His New Testament economy (15:1; Gal. 2:3-4; 6:12-13; Phil. 3:2; see note 14 in ch. 10). ",
  "3189":"Or, making no distinction. ",
  "3190":"The six brothers were present while Peter was speaking, as witnesses to his word. ",
  "3191":"See note 31 in ch. 16. ",
  "3192":"Gk. zoe, referring to the life of God (Eph. 4:18), the eternal life (1 John 1:2), the uncreated, indestructible life (Heb. 7:16), which is Christ Himself (John 14:6; 11:25; Col. 3:4) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), of which life the Spirit is (Rom. 8:2). This life is received by the believers through their believing into Christ (John 3:15-16) after repentance, and issues in their full salvation (Rom. 5:10). The gospel preached by Peter comprises the divine blessings not only of forgiveness (5:31; 10:43) and salvation (2:21; 4:12) but also of the Spirit (2:38) and life. Forgiveness deals with people's sins, and life, with people's death (John 5:24; 1 John 3:14; 2 Cor. 5:4). ",
  "3193":"See note 4 in ch. 8. ",
  "3194":"This indicates how strong the Jewish believers were in keeping their traditions. They would not come near the Gentiles (10:28). This condition continued even after Peter's preaching to Cornelius, an Italian. It surely restricted the Lord's move in spreading His gospel according to God's New Testament economy. ",
  "3195":"They must have been from among the Jewish believers in dispersion (cf. 1 Pet. 1:1). ",
  "3196":"This was a further step of the Lord's move in spreading His gospel to the Gentiles after what happened in the house of Cornelius (ch. 10) and before Paul's ministry to the Gentiles, which began in ch. 13. ",
  "3197":"The Greek word denotes being sent out (on a mission) as an authoritative representative. Barnabas was sent out from Jerusalem to visit the believers in other places; he was sent with authority from the apostles, not from the church, because the apostles were there in Jerusalem. ",
  "3198":"Saul was saved by the Lord directly without any preaching channel (9:3-6) and was brought into identification with the Body of Christ through Ananias, a member of the Body of Christ (9:10-19). However, he was introduced to practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem through Barnabas (9:26-28). Now Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to go as far as Antioch to encourage the believers, and he went to Tarsus to bring Saul to Antioch (vv. 25-26). This was a great step. It initiated Saul into the Lord's move in spreading the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world (13:1-3; see note 25 in ch. 12). ",
  "3199":"See notes 14 in John 1 and 10 in 1 Cor. 15. The grace that was seen by Barnabas must have been the Triune God received and enjoyed by the believers and expressed in their salvation, change in life, holy living, and the gifts they exercised in their meetings, all of which could be seen by others. ",
  "3200":"I.e., be persistently faithful to the Lord, cleave to Him, and live in close fellowship with Him. ",
  "3201":"See note 3 in ch. 6. ",
  "3202":"Or, crowd (also in v. 26). ",
  "3203":"See note 16 in 1 Pet. 4. That the disciples in Antioch were given such a nickname, a term of reproach, indicates that they must have borne a strong testimony for the Lord, a testimony that made them distinct and peculiar in the eyes of the unbelievers. ",

  "3205":"A Caesar of the Roman Empire. In the fourth year of his reign, about A.D. 44, there was a famine in Judea and the neighboring countries. ",
  "3206":"This verse shows that the believers' having all things in common (2:44-45; 4:32), which was practiced at the time of Pentecost, had become a thing of the past at the time the matter here was mentioned, no more than ten years after Pentecost, long before Paul began his ministry to the Gentiles (13:2-4). This word indicates further that there was no uniformly prescribed way in the early days of the church concerning the believers' giving of material things; rather, it was left to each believer to give out of his own will and his own initiation. ",
  "3207":"The Greek word here means to progress favorably, or to go on smoothly; hence, it denotes to thrive smoothly, to prosper, in an enterprise, an occupation, or other activities. Prosperity is given by God, and it issues in surplus and abundance. ",
  "3208":"Lit., for a service. Derived from the same Greek word as the word for ministered in Matt. 4:11. ",
  "3209":"This indicates that in the early days the finances of the church were under the management of the elders (see note 3 in 1 Tim. 3). ",
  "3210":"Now Saul, through Barnabas, was brought into the service among the churches. ",
  "3211":"Herod, Agrippa I, whose successor was King Agrippa (II) in 25:13. Both were different from Herod the tetrarch in 13:1. Thus far the church had suffered persecution only from the Jewish religion. Now Gentile politics began to participate in the persecution in cooperation with the Jewish religion (v. 11). ",
  "3212":"A quaternion was a group of four soldiers. ",
  "3213":"Perhaps Peter felt that he had gone out of himself as in a trance; now he came to himself, that is, became sober. Cf. note 10 in ch. 10. ",
  "3214":"Not only the apostle Peter had an angel; even the little ones among the believers have their angels (Matt. 18:10). Angels are servants to the believers who inherit God's salvation (see note 14 in Heb. 1). This is an arrangement in God's eternal economy. ",
  "3215":"This indicates that James was a leader among the apostles and among the elders of Jerusalem (cf. 15:13; 21:18; Gal. 1:19; 2:9, 12). ",

This verse is a continuation of 11:30, which, with the preceding verses from 11:22, is a narration of Paul's initiation into his apostolic ministry (see note 22 in ch. 11). The passage from 11:19--12:25 is a transitional record between Peter's apostolic ministry to the Jews in chs. 2--11 and Paul's apostolic ministry to the Gentiles in chs. 13--28 (cf. Gal. 2:7-8). ",

  "3227":"The one who killed John the Baptist (Luke 9:7-9). It was the Lord's sovereign doing that the foster brother of John the Baptist's murderer became one of the leading functioning members in the church. ",
  "3228":"A Jew born in Tarsus and taught by Gamaliel according to the law of Moses (22:3). The five prophets and teachers recorded here were composed of Jews and Gentiles, each having a different background, education, and status. This indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of people regardless of their background, and that the spiritual gifts and functions given to the members of the Body of Christ are not based on their natural status. ",
  "3229":"Not conferring with men and organizing. ",
  "3230":"As the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the Body. ",
  "3231":"This was a great step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world. It was begun from Antioch, a Gentile center in Syria, without the organizing of a mission, without the raising of funds, without human ordination, and without any human plan or method. It was initiated by five faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ, who gave the Head of the Body an opportunity through their ministering and fasting, that He, as the Spirit, might set them apart to carry out His great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishing of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of His gospel. This major step had nothing to do with the church in Jerusalem organizationally, and it was not under the authority and direction of Peter and the other eleven apostles in Jerusalem. It was begun solely and purely from a Gentile center, far away from the atmosphere and influence of any Judaic background and practice and even from the practice and influence of the church in Jerusalem. It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ on the earth with the Head in the heavens. Hence, this was not a religious movement with a human schedule. From Antioch the Lord's move on the earth for God's New Testament economy had an entirely new start. Although the flow of the Lord's move began from Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and later came to Antioch and went on from Antioch to the Gentile world, it had a purified start by the Spirit at its turn in Antioch. ",
  "3232":"Not discussed and decided. ",
  "3233":"See note 14 in 1 Tim. 4. Here the laying on of hands denotes identification, signifying that they who laid their hands were one with those on whom they laid hands. By this they declared to all that they were one with the sent ones in their going to carry out the Lord's great commission. ",
  "3234":"In v. 3 Barnabas and Saul were sent by the other three. But here it says that they were sent out by the Spirit. This proves that the three were one with the Spirit in the Lord's move, and the Spirit honored their sending as His. ",
  "3235":"This was the start of Paul's first ministry journey, which ended in 14:27. ",
  "3236":"Barnabas and Saul did not go to attend the Jewish synagogue gathering but to take advantage of that gathering to announce the word of God, just as the Lord did in His ministry on the earth (Matt. 4:23; Luke 4:16). See note 14. ",

  "3261":"The Greek word for the holy things here is in the plural. The same Greek word is used for Holy One in the next verse, but in the singular. However, it is not the regular word for holy; it is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word chesed, which is translated mercies in Isa. 55:3 in the KJV, and also in 2 Chron. 6:42 and Psa. 89:1, both in the Septuagint and the KJV. In Psa. 89, the word mercies in plural in v. 1 is the same word as for Holy One in singular in v. 19. This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God's mercies are centered and conveyed. Hence, the holy things of David, the faithful things refers to the resurrected Christ. This is fully proved by the context, especially by Your Holy One in the next verse, and by the verse following Isa. 55:3. ",

  "3273":"This word is a quotation from Isa. 49:6, which refers to Christ as God's Servant, whom God made a light to the Gentiles that His salvation might reach to the end of the earth. Because he was one with Christ in carrying out God's salvation in Christ, the apostle Paul applied this prophetic word to himself in his ministry of gospel preaching for the turning of the gospel from the Jews, because of their rejection, to the Gentiles. In His ministry on earth the Lord expressed the same thing to the stubborn Jews in Luke 4:24-27. ",
  "3274":"Or, ordained. One's rejecting the gospel is evidence that he is unworthy of eternal life (v. 46); one's believing it is proof that he was appointed or ordained by God to eternal life. God's ordination, or predestination, for man's salvation is sovereignly of Himself. However, He still leaves man to his own free will. Whether man would believe or reject His salvation is up to man's own decision. ",

Hence, the elders appointed in these churches could not have been fully mature. They must have been considered elders because they were comparatively the most mature among the believers. They were not voted in by their congregations but were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity of life in Christ.

  "3298":"See notes 2 in ch. 11 and 14 in ch. 10. In God's New Testament economy, to be circumcised is to make Christ of no profit to the believers. ",
  "3299":"To keep the custom of Moses, that is, to practice the outward ordinances of the law, is not only to nullify the grace of God and make Christ's death of no effect (Gal. 2:21) but also to bring the believers, whom Christ has set free, back to the slavery of law (Gal. 5:1; 2:4). ",
  "3300":"This was Paul and Barnabas's contending for the faith (Jude 3) against one of the greatest heresies, that the truth of the gospel might remain with the believers (Gal. 2:5). ",
  "3301":"It was not because Jerusalem was the headquarters of God's move, or because the church in Jerusalem was the head church controlling other churches, that Paul, Barnabas, and certain others went to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. It was because Jerusalem was the source from which the heretical teaching concerning circumcision came. In order to solve the problem and uproot the trouble, they needed to go to the source. Unlike the situation with the Roman Catholic Church, according to God's New Testament economy there is no headquarters for God's move on earth and no head church that controls other churches. The headquarters of God's move in His New Testament economy is in the heavens (Rev. 4:2-3; 5:1), and the One who rules over all the churches is Christ, the Head of the church (Col. 1:18; Rev. 2:1). ",
  "3302":"The going up to Jerusalem by Paul, Barnabas, and certain others was the move of the church, not the move of themselves as individuals. They did not act individualistically apart from the church, but corporately in and with the church. This was the move of the Body of Christ. ",

The conference had no chairman; the presiding One was the Spirit (v. 28), the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the church (Col. 1:18) and the Lord of all (10:36). Much discussion had taken place (v. 7) indicates that everyone in the conference had the freedom to speak. The decision was made based on (1) the testimony shared by Peter (vv. 7-11), (2) the facts related by Barnabas and Paul (v. 12), and (3) the concluding word given by James (vv. 13-21), who was the leading one among the apostles and elders in Jerusalem (12:17; 21:18; Gal. 1:19; 2:9) because of the influence he exercised over the believers by his piety (see note 4 in James 1).

  "3310":"The yoke of the law, which was a bondage under slavery (Gal. 5:1 and note 4). To require people to keep the law of slavery not only enslaves people but also tests God. Even God could not and would not make man keep the law of dead letters. ",
  "3311":"This grace comprises the Lord's person (see note 21 in Gal. 2) and His redemptive work (Rom. 3:24). Peter and the Jewish believers were saved by this grace, not by keeping the law of Moses. As far as God's salvation is concerned, to keep the law means nothing to either the Jews or the Gentiles. ",

The responsibility for the problem should rest with Barnabas, because after this incident he no longer appears in the divine record in Acts concerning the Lord's move in God's New Testament economy. The reason for his failure might have been his natural relationship with Mark, his cousin (Col. 4:10), who left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way in their first ministry journey (13:13 and note 1). Mark was later recovered to Paul's ministry (2 Tim. 4:11; Philem. 24), but Barnabas was not. Disputes that arise among the co-workers because of personal relationships are terrible! Remember this well! ",
  "3325":"This was the start of Paul's second ministry journey, which ended in 18:22. ",
  "3326":"See note 2 in ch. 11. ",
  "3327":"This indicates that the strong influence of the Judaic background remained among the Jewish believers. It disturbed and frustrated the move of the Lord's gospel (see note 14 in ch. 10). ",
  "3328":"See notes 1 in ch. 8 and 31 in ch. 9. ",
  "3329":"As in the evangelistic work of Philip (8:29, 39), the move of the apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference or according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Holy Spirit according to God's counsel. They intended to speak the word in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade them. Forbidding is a part of the Holy Spirit's leading. ",
  "3330":"The Spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament; the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed for the apostle's preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering carried out among human beings and for human beings in the human life. ",
  "3331":"The Holy Spirit's forbidding them to go to the left, to Asia (v. 6), and the Spirit of Jesus' not allowing them to go to the right, to Bithynia, indicated a straightforward direction for the apostle and his co-workers. Thus, they went in a direct course to Macedonia through Mysia and Troas (v. 8). ",

It explains the intention of the Holy Spirit's forbidding, the Spirit of Jesus' not allowing, and the coming of the vision in the night. To carry out this particular leading in the Lord's strategic move required the endeavoring of the apostle and his co-workers. This they did immediately. ",
  "3336":"After seeing the vision from God, they needed to conclude, that is, to understand what it meant, by exercising the mind &#151; a mind saturated and directed by the spirit (Eph. 4:23) &#151; according to the actual situation and environment. ",

  "3353":"Again baptism was practiced immediately after someone believed. See note 15. This must have been done in the bathing pool at the place where they were, which, according to the word up in the next verse, must have been downstairs.

  "3354":"See note 33. ",
  "3355":"After believing and being baptized, the jailer did not care for the officials who were his superiors or for the criminals. He too came into fellowship with the apostles, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, as a token of his salvation. See note 15. ",

Such a spirit was provoked by the many idols in Athens. ",
  "3365":"Even the highest culture did not prevent these people from worshipping idols. Within them, as within all mankind, was a God-worshipping spirit created by God for man to seek and worship Him (cf. v. 22). However, because of their blindness and ignorance, they took the wrong objects for their worship (v. 23). Now the very true God, who created the universe and them, sent His apostle to announce the true object whom they should worship (vv. 23-29). ",
  "3366":"The Epicurean philosophers were the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 B.C.), whose philosophy was materialism. They did not recognize the Creator and His providence over the world but sought sensuous pleasures, especially in eating and drinking. Some of Paul's words to the Philippians (Phil. 3:18 and note 1) and the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:32 and note 3) referred to the Epicureans. ",
  "3367":"The Stoic philosophers were members of a school of philosophy founded by Zeno (340-265 B.C.). They were pantheists who believed that everything was governed by fate and that all happenings were the result of the divine will, and therefore that man should calmly accept them, free from all passion, grief, or joy. They emphasized that the highest good is virtue and that virtue is the reward given to the soul. Some of the words in Paul's Epistle to the Philippians referred to the Stoics (Phil. 4:11 and note 1).

  "3372":"Lit., Men, Athenians. More dignified and solemn than simply \"Athenians.\" ",
  "3373":"The Greek word here means fearing a demon, a supernatural spirit; hence, given up to demon worship, very much revering the deities. The same word is used in noun form in 25:19. ",
  "3374":"The apostle's word in vv. 24-25 was a very strong inoculation to both the atheistic Epicureans, who did not recognize the Creator and His providence over the world, and the pantheistic Stoics, who submitted themselves to the will of many gods concerning their fate (cf. v. 18). ",
  "3375":"Adam. Some ancient MSS read, one blood. ",

This does not mean that unbelievers have God's life and live, exist, and act in God like the believers in Christ, who are born of God, possess His divine life and nature, and live, exist, and act in His divine person. ",
  "3379":"Probably referring to Aratus (about 270 B.C.) and Cleanthes (about 300 B.C.), both of whom uttered these same words in their poems to Zeus (Jupiter), whom they considered the supreme God. ",
  "3380":"In the writings of the two poets His refers to Zeus as the supreme God. ",
  "3381":"Just as Adam was thought to be the son of God (Luke 3:38 and note 2). Since God is the Creator, the source, of all men, He is the Father of them all (Mal. 2:10) in a natural sense, not in the spiritual sense in which He is the Father of all the believers (Gal. 4:6), who are regenerated by Him in their spirit (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:5-6). ",
  "3382":"Gk. theion, meaning that which is divine. It is not the same as theiotes in Rom. 1:20, which denotes the characteristics of divinity, nor is it the same as theotes in Col. 2:9, which denotes the Godhead, God Himself. Theion is a more vague and abstract word than theiotes and is not as definite as theotes, which is definite in denoting the Godhead, God Himself. Cf. note 20 in Rom. 1. ",

This probably does not include the day when He will judge dead men at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15), as in 10:42 (see note there), 2 Tim. 4:1, and 1 Pet. 4:5, because on the day mentioned here He will judge the world, which should refer only to living men. This day of Christ's judgment on earth will be brought in by His coming back. He was designated by God to execute this judgment, and God's raising Him from the dead is strong proof of this. In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 24:25 stressed the coming judgment of God. ",
  "3386":"Or, faith, assurance, guarantee. The resurrection of Christ is proof and assurance that He is coming back to judge all the inhabitants of the earth. This is guaranteed that we may have faith in it and that it may lead us to repent (v. 30). ",

Paul was a Jew and kept the vow, but he would not and did not impose it on the Gentiles. According to the principle of his teaching concerning God's New Testament economy, Paul should have given up all the Jewish practices, which belonged to the Old Testament dispensation. However, he still had this vow, and it seems that God tolerated it, probably because it was a vow carried out in private outside Jerusalem and would not have had much effect on the believers. ",

At that time Paul was in Ephesus on his third ministry journey, busy with a heavy burden to carry out his ministry in Asia (1 Cor. 16:8-9) and in Macedonia and Achaia (1 Cor. 16:5-7; Acts 20:1-3). Nonetheless, he still had a burden to spare part of his time for the needy saints in Jerusalem. When he arrived in Corinth, he wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome, expressing the purpose of his trip and begging them to pray for him concerning this purpose (Rom. 15:25-31). Although he was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles (22:21; Gal. 2:8), Paul was still concerned for the Lord's interest among the Jews. His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles. <br><br>   Besides this, his purpose in going to Jerusalem at this juncture might also have been to fellowship with James and the other apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding the Judaic influence on the church there. According to Paul's teachings in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, the decision made by the conference of the apostles and elders in ch. 15 to resolve the problem concerning circumcision must not have been fully satisfactory to him. This undoubtedly troubled him because of his concern for God's New Testament economy, which is to build up the Body of Christ. James's word in 21:20-22, after Paul had arrived in Jerusalem (21:17-18), and his proposal that Paul participate in the four Jewish believers' Nazarite vow (21:23-24) seem to confirm this view. ",
  "3427":"Since the Lord the Spirit dwelt in Paul's spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:10-11), Paul must have purposed according to the leading of the Lord the Spirit. See note 16 in ch. 17. ",
  "3428":"Paul did go to Jerusalem (21:17), and he did see Rome (28:14, 16). ",
  "3429":"This desire of Paul's was fulfilled by the Lord when He brought Paul to Rome through his appeal to Caesar (23:11; note 11 in ch. 25). ",
  "3430":"A city treasurer of Corinth (Rom. 16:23; cf. 2 Tim. 4:20), of high rank, who probably had been converted by Paul's preaching in Corinth (cf. 18:8) and had become an attendant to Paul. ",
  "3431":"It was at this time, in Ephesus, that the apostle wrote his first Epistle to the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 16:3-10, 19, and note 8; 4:17; cf. Acts 19:20-23, 8-10, 17; 20:1). ",
  "3432":"See note 2 in ch. 9. ",
  "3433":"Not the Demetrius in 3 John 12. ",
  "3434":"A dirty and demonic trade. Those who practiced such a trade cooperated with the demons to possess and usurp people for Satan's evil kingdom (Matt. 12:26). ",
  "3435":"Artemis was the Ephesian goddess. To the Romans she was the goddess Diana (Latin). ",
  "3436":"Behind the idol worship were demons, who instigated the uproar against the apostle to disturb and frustrate the preaching of the gospel. This was Satan's fighting against God's spreading of His kingdom on the earth. ",
  "3437":"See note 26 in ch. 7. ",
  "3438":"See note 1 in 3 John. ",
  "3439":"Principal persons of the province of Asia. ",

  "3442":"I.e., fallen from heaven. ",
  "3443":"Or, regular assembly. ",
  "3444":"This was the sovereignty of the Lord; it preserved His apostle from the demonic uproar. ",
  "3445":"It was there that Paul wrote his second Epistle to the church in Corinth (2 Cor. 2:13 and note 2; 7:5-6; 8:1; 9:2, 4). ",
  "3446":"During that time, in Corinth, the apostle wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome (Rom. 15:22-32; cf. Acts 19:21; 20:1-3; 1 Cor. 16:3-7). ",
  "3447":"Paul had originally intended to go to Jerusalem through Syria from Achaia in Greece (19:21; 1 Cor. 16:3-7). Because of the Jews' plot against him, he changed his route, going northward to Macedonia. From there he returned to Jerusalem. He knew that the Jews were plotting against him and that he would suffer because of this (v. 19). Therefore, he begged the saints in Rome to pray for him concerning his return to Jerusalem (Rom. 15:25-26, 30-31). This might also have been the reason that he was bound in his spirit to go to Jerusalem (v. 22). Eventually, after returning to Jerusalem, he was seized by the Jews (21:27-30), who sought to kill him (21:31; 23:12-15). ",
  "3448":"See note 1 in 3 John. ",
  "3449":"The Lord's Day (Rev. 1:10). Paul stayed in Troas for seven days (v. 6), but it was only on the first day of the week that they gathered together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. This indicates that at that time the apostle and the church considered the first day of the week a day to meet together for the Lord. ",
  "3450":"Including the writer, Luke. ",
  "3451":"Or, tasted. ",
  "3452":"Probably to meet people from different countries who came to Jerusalem on that day (cf. 2:1, 5). ",

  "3457":"Lit., in it. ",
  "3458":"Paul did not know what he would encounter in Jerusalem (v. 22), but he did know one thing: the Holy Spirit was solemnly testifying to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him. The Holy Spirit's testifying was only a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge. Hence, he must not have taken it as a command but as a warning. See notes 4 and 11 in ch. 21. ",
  "3459":"Implying that Paul sensed he was going to be martyred. ",
  "3460":"Or, soul. ",

  "3464":"I.e., I am free from blame if any of you should suffer death. ",
  "3465":"See note 2 in 1 Pet. 5. ",
  "3466":"The apostles appointed the elders in every church (14:23). But here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing, said that the Holy Spirit did it, indicating that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing of the elders, and that the apostles did it according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "3467":"I.e., the elders of the church (v. 17), proving that overseer and elder are synonymous terms denoting the same person. To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous. That is what Ignatius did. His erroneous teaching became the basis for the establishing of rank and brought in the hierarchy (see note 2 in 1 Tim. 3). ",
  "3468":"The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over but to shepherd, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God (see notes 2 and 3 in 1 Pet. 5). ",
  "3469":"Indicating the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God. Here the apostle did not touch the divine life and nature of the church as in Eph. 5:23-32, but the value of the church as a treasure to God, a treasure which He acquired with His own precious blood. Paul expected that the elders as overseers would treasure the church as God did. <br><br>   Both the Holy Spirit and God's own blood are divine provisions for the church that He treasures. The Holy Spirit is God Himself, and God's own blood denotes God's work. God's redemptive work acquired the church; now God Himself, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), cares for the church through the overseers. <br><br>   God's own blood is the blood of Jesus Christ. This implies that the Lord Jesus is God. ",
  "3470":"The apostle did not care for his own life, but he was very concerned for the future of the church, which was a treasure to him as well as to God. ",
  "3471":"The perverted ones among the believers in the church are always used by the devil, who hates the church, to draw the sheep away to form another flock. ",
  "3472":"Some MSS read, the Lord. ",
  "3473":"See note 23 in ch. 11. ",
  "3474":"The Greek word here refers to the legal inheritance of a share of an estate. Cf. note 18 in ch. 26. ",
  "3475":"To participate in God's inheritance requires us to be sanctified, and to be sanctified requires the word of God's grace (John 17:17 and note 1). ",
  "3476":"Making tents (18:3). ",
  "3477":"Or, the infirm. Referring to those who were weak physically (1 Cor. 11:30); hence, the poor ones. ",
  "3478":"This word is not recorded in the Gospels; it must have been received by oral communication. ",
  "3479":"In 20:23 the Holy Spirit made known to Paul that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem (see note 1 there). Now the Spirit took a further step to tell him, through some members of the Body of Christ, not to go to Jerusalem. Since Paul practiced the Body life, he should have taken this word and obeyed it as a word from the Head. ",
  "3480":"Wherever Paul went, he visited the brothers and stayed with them (vv. 4, 7). He was actually practicing the Body life of the church, living according to what he taught concerning the Body of Christ. ",
  "3481":"Again, the Holy Spirit told Paul beforehand, indirectly through a member of the Body of Christ, what would befall Paul in Jerusalem (see note 23 in ch. 20). This was again a warning in the nature of a prophecy, not a charge. It was again the Head speaking through His Body (see note 4). Since Paul practiced the Body life, he should have listened to this speaking. ",
  "3482":"Including Luke, the writer. Here the Body of Christ, through many members, expressed its feeling, entreating Paul not to go to Jerusalem. But because of his strong will, manifested in his readiness even to sacrifice his life for the Lord (v. 13), he would not be persuaded, forcing the members of the Body of Christ to leave this matter to the will of the Lord (v. 14). ",
  "3483":"In Jerusalem. ",
  "3484":"This was the end of Paul's third ministry journey, which began in 18:23. ",
  "3485":"See notes 17 in ch. 12 and 19 in Gal. 1. ",
  "3486":"Or, myriads, ten thousands. ",
  "3487":"Indicating that the Jewish believers in Jerusalem still kept the law of Moses, remained in the Old Testament dispensation, and were strongly under the Judaic influence, mixing God's New Testament economy with the outdated Old Testament economy (see notes 1 in James 1 and 10 in James 2). ",
  "3488":"To forsake the law of Moses, not to circumcise, and not to walk according to the customs of dead letters are actually according to God's New Testament economy. But these were considered by the unbelieving Jews, and even by the Jewish believers in Christ, to be apostasy from God's Old Testament dispensation. ",
  "3489":"Some MSS read, A multitude must certainly gather, for they will hear that you have come. ",
  "3490":"Referring to the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:2-5). ",
  "3491":"To be purified with the Nazarites was to become a Nazarite with them, joining them in the fulfilling of their vow. The same word is used in the Septuagint in Num. 6:3 in describing the Nazarite's duties. To take the Nazarite vow was a purification before God. ",
  "3492":"The cost of the offerings, which a Nazarite had to pay for the completion of his purification (Num. 6:13-17). This was very expensive for the poor Nazarites. It was a custom among the Jews, and was considered proof of great piety, that a rich person would pay for the poor the expenses of the offerings. ",
  "3493":"To be done at the completion of the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:18). This shaving differed from the shearing in 18:18 (see note 1 there), which was for a private vow. ",
  "3494":"I.e., participating in their Nazarite vow (see note 24). To do this Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow; then the priest would offer the offerings for each one of them, including him. Surely he was clear that such a practice was of the outdated dispensation, which, according to the principle of his teaching in the New Testament ministry, should be repudiated in God's New Testament economy. Yet he went through with it, probably because of his Jewish background, which had also been manifested earlier in his private vow in 18:18, and probably because he was practicing his word in 1 Cor. 9:20. However, his toleration jeopardized God's New Testament economy; this God would not tolerate. At this point he must have felt that he was in a predicament, and he must have been deeply troubled, longing to be delivered from it. Just at the time when their vow was to be concluded, God allowed an uproar to rise up against him, and what they intended to accomplish was blown away (v. 27). Moreover, by God's sovereignty Paul was rescued out of his predicament. <br><br>   The mixing of Judaic practices with God's New Testament economy was not only erroneous in relation to God's dispensation but also abominable in the eyes of God. This gross mixture was terminated by Him a mere ten years or so later with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Judaism, through Titus and his Roman army. This rescued and absolutely separated the church from the devastation of Judaism. <br><br>   God might have tolerated Paul's carrying out of a private vow in 18:18, but He would not allow Paul, a vessel chosen by Him not only for the completing of His New Testament revelation (Col. 1:25) but also for the carrying out of His New Testament economy (Eph. 3:2, 7-8), to participate in the Nazarite vow, a strict Judaic practice. In going to Jerusalem, Paul's intention might have been to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there (see note 21 par. 2, in ch. 19), but God knew that the church there was incurable. Hence, in His sovereignty God allowed Paul to be arrested by the Jews and imprisoned by the Romans that he might write his last eight Epistles (see note 11 in ch. 25), which completed the divine revelation (Col. 1:25) and gave the church a clearer and deeper view concerning God's New Testament economy (Eph. 3:3-4). Thus, God left the Judaism-influenced church in Jerusalem to remain as it was until the devastating mixture was terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem. For Paul to write his last eight Epistles to complete God's New Testament revelation was far more important and necessary than for him to accomplish some outward works for the church. ",
  "3495":"I.e., the completion of the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:13). ",
  "3496":"See note 22 in ch. 2. ",
  "3497":"God's New Testament teaching according to His New Testament economy was indeed against the Jews, who opposed God's New Testament economy (Matt. 21:41, 43-45; 22:7; 23:32-36; Acts 7:51; 13:40-41), against the law of dead letters (Rom. 3:20, 28; 6:14; 7:4, 6; Gal. 2:19, 21; 5:4), and against the holy place, the temple (Matt. 23:38 and note 1; 24:2; Acts 7:48). Since Paul's ministry was to carry out God's New Testament economy, it could not please the Jews, who were possessed and usurped by Satan, the enemy of God, and were instigated by him to oppose and ravage God's New Testament move. Hence, it offended the Jews and was opposed to the law and the temple, for which they were zealous, and it stirred up their jealousy and hatred to the uttermost, so that they made a plot (20:3) to do away with Paul (vv. 31, 36). ",

For the accomplishing of His redemption, Christ was like a lamb brought to the slaughter; and like a sheep dumb before its shearer, He did not open His mouth when judged by men (Isa. 53:7; Matt. 26:62-63; 27:12, 14). But as a faithful and bold apostle sent by the Lord, Paul needed to make a defense and exercise his wisdom to save his life from his persecutors that he might fulfill the course of his ministry. Although he was willing and ready to sacrifice his life for the Lord (20:24; note 12 in ch. 21; 21:13), he still endeavored to live longer that he might carry out the Lord's ministry as much as possible.

All the believers knew that he had considered calling on the Lord's name a sign of those whom he should arrest (9:14, 21). Now he had turned to the Lord. In order for Paul to wash away, before God and before all the believers, the sins that he had committed in persecuting and arresting the Lord's callers, he was charged by Ananias to call on the name that he had formerly abhorred. He had to do this &#151; an act contrary to his former practice &#151; at his baptism, in which he made a public confession of the Lord whom he had persecuted. ",

But man failed to live and walk according to his conscience and fell further into wickedness (Gen. 6:5). After the judgment of the flood, God ordained that man should be under human government (Gen. 9:6). Man failed in this also. Then, before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in his seed, Christ (Gen. 12:3; Gal. 3:8), God put man under the test of the law (Rom. 3:20; 5:20). Man failed this test utterly. All these failures indicate that man has fallen from God to his conscience, from his conscience to human government, and from human government to lawlessness; that is, man has fallen to the uttermost. Hence, to conduct oneself in all good conscience before God, as Paul did, was a great return to God from man's fall. Paul spoke this word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even reckless person. In his defense he referred again to his conscience in 24:16. This showed his high standard of morality, in contrast to the hypocrisy of the Jewish religionists and the crookedness of the Roman (Gentile) politicians. See notes 12 in this chapter, 2 24 26 and 27 in ch. 24, and 9 and 13 in ch. 25. ",

Through the riot of the Jews in Jerusalem, God delivered Paul out of the predicament into which he fell when he took James's compromising proposal and participated in the Nazarite vow. Now, through the commander of the Roman cohort, God in His sovereignty again rescued Paul, this time from the hand of the rioting Jews, who had attempted to kill him, that He might separate him from all the dangerous situations and entrapments and send him to a quiet prison. This was to afford him a quiet environment and give him time, whether in Caesarea (24:27) or in the city of Rome (28:16, 23, 30), that through his last Epistles he might release exhaustively to the church throughout the generations the revelation of the mystery of God's New Testament economy that he received from the Lord. The benefit and profit that the church throughout the generations has received from these Epistles will take eternity to measure. ",
  "3537":"According to the Jewish calendar, sundown is the beginning of the next day. ",

  "3539":"The Lord admitted that the apostle did bear a solemn testimony concerning Him in Jerusalem. A testimony differs from mere teaching (see note 40 in ch. 2). ",
  "3540":"To carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches as His fullness, the ascended Christ wanted to use not a group of preachers trained by man's teaching to do a preaching work, but a body of His witnesses, martyrs, who bore a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ (see notes 8 in ch. 1 and 16 in ch. 26). Satan could instigate the Jewish religionists and utilize the Gentile politicians to bind the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, but he could not bind Christ's living witnesses and their living testimonies. The more they bound the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, the stronger and brighter these martyrs of Christ and their living testimonies became. In His appearing to the apostle, the Lord indicated that He would not rescue him immediately from his bonds but would leave him in bonds and bring him to Rome that he might testify concerning Him, as he had done in Jerusalem. The Lord encouraged Paul to do this. ",

The resurrection of the unrighteous will occur after the millennium (Rev. 20:5).

  "3572":"For his defense Paul wanted to appeal to Caesar (see notes 1 in ch. 22 and 32 in ch. 26). This would allow him to fulfill his desire to see Rome for the furtherance of the Lord's testimony (19:21) and was according to the Lord's indication to him (23:11). Without this appeal he would have been killed by the Jews who plotted against him (cf. 23:12-15; 25:1-3, 9) and would not have been able to write his last eight Epistles. Before his appeal to Rome, he had written only six Epistles: 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Galatians, Romans, and 1 and 2 Corinthians. During his first imprisonment in Rome he wrote Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. After that imprisonment he wrote 1 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews. Then, during his second imprisonment he wrote 2 Timothy. Without these last eight Epistles, what a lack the divine revelation would have and what a loss the church would have suffered! His appeal did render great profit and benefit to the Lord's interest. ",

The Lord's word here signifies that Saul was already yoked to the plow and had no choice but to take the Lord's yoke obediently for the carrying out of the Lord's commission. It was hard for him to kick against the goads on the Lord's plow. ",
  "3590":"See note 5 in ch. 9. ",
  "3591":"Not only a minister but also a witness. A minister is for the ministry; a witness, for the testimony. The ministry is related mainly to the work, to what a minister does; a testimony is related to the person, to what a witness is (see notes 8 in ch. 1 and 11 in ch. 23). ",
  "3592":"This was to carry out the fulfillment of God's jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord, proclaimed by the Lord Jesus in Luke 4:18-21 (see note 19 in Luke 4) according to God's New Testament economy. The first item of the spiritual and divine blessings of the New Testament jubilee, which are the blessings of the gospel of God, is to open the eyes of those who are fallen and turn them from darkness to light, that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm. To see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light. ",
  "3593":"Darkness is a sign of sin and death; light, a sign of righteousness and life (John 1:4; 8:12). ",
  "3594":"The authority of Satan is Satan's kingdom, which belongs to darkness (Matt. 12:26 and note 1). ",

  "3596":"The base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee. ",
  "3597":"Lit., a portion; referring to a portion of an inheritance. This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. The Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (Col. 1:12). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:14), which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste in God's New Testament jubilee, and which we will enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (1 Pet. 1:4). In the type of the jubilee in Lev. 25:8-13, the main blessings are the liberty proclaimed and the returning of every man to his own possession. In the fulfillment of the jubilee here, liberation from the authority of darkness and the receiving of the divine inheritance are the primary blessings (cf. note 32 in ch. 20). ",
  "3598":"Not only positionally but also dispositionally (Rom. 6:19 and note 2, 22). To be sanctified positionally is only to have a change in position and purpose; to be sanctified dispositionally is to be transformed in nature by and with the holy nature of God (2 Cor. 3:18). To be sanctified is to be saturated with God as our possession for our enjoyment today. Our sanctification will consummate in our maturity in the divine life that we may resemble God and be qualified to fully possess and enjoy Him as our inheritance in the coming age and for eternity. ",
  "3599":"Not a doctrine, a theory, a religious creed, or any theology, but a heavenly vision, in which the apostle saw the divine things concerning the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people. All his preaching in this book and his writing in his fourteen Epistles, from Romans through Hebrews, are a detailed description of this heavenly vision seen by Paul. ",

",
  "3607":"But without his appeal to Caesar, the apostle might have been killed by the Jews through Festus's unjust handling of him (25:9), and thus his life might not have been preserved to that day. See note 11 in ch. 25. ",

  "3623":"Although Paul was a prisoner in bonds, his behavior displayed much ascendancy with dignity. Luke's narration, as an account of the Lord's move on earth, stresses not doctrine but the testimony of the Lord's witnesses (1:8). Hence, in his narration there are no details related to doctrine; rather, there are details regarding the things that happened to His witnesses, in order to portray the testimonies in their lives. This is especially so with Paul's voyage in the last two chapters of this book. ",
  "3624":"Lit., serve as a priest. ",

  "3634":"Gk. Dike, perhaps a reference to the goddess in Greek mythology, who was in charge of meting out justice. ",
  "3635":"The apostle was not a god, in contrast to what the curious natives believed in their superstition. Rather, in his living and ministry he expressed the very true God, who in Jesus Christ had gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, was then living in him and through him. ",
  "3636":"On the sea in the storm, the Lord had made the apostle not only the owner of his fellow voyagers (27:24) but also their life-guarantor and comforter (27:22, 25). Now, on the land in peace, the Lord made him furthermore not only a magical attraction in the eyes of the superstitious people (vv. 3-6) but also a healer and a joy to them (vv. 8-9). All during the apostle's long and unfortunate imprisonment-voyage, the Lord kept the apostle in His ascendancy and enabled him to live a life far beyond the realm of anxiety. This life was fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes, a life that resembled the one that the Lord Himself had lived on the earth years before. This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity! This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in the Acts through one of His many members! This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ! Paul in his voyage lived and magnified Christ (Phil. 1:20-21). It is no wonder that the people honored him and his companions with many honors (v. 10), that is, with the greatest respect and highest regard! An ambassador sent by God should be treated by men with such respect and regard. ",
  "3637":"Gk. Dioskouroi, the twin sons of Zeus, Castor and Pollux, the guardian deities of sailors. A figure of these two was affixed to the stern. ",
  "3638":"I.e., Rome. ",
  "3639":"The warm welcome of the brothers from Rome and the loving care of those in Puteoli (vv. 13-14) show the beautiful Body life that existed in the early days among the churches and apostles. This life was a part of the heavenly kingdom life on the Satan-darkened and man-inhabited earth. Apparently, the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the region of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire; actually, as the ambassador of Christ with His authority (Eph. 6:20; Matt. 28:18-19), he had come into another part of the participation in the Body life of Christ's church in the kingdom of God on earth. While he was suffering the persecution of religion in the empire of Satan, he was enjoying the church life in the kingdom of God. This was a comfort and an encouragement to him. ",
  "3640":"A place more than 40 miles from Rome. ",
  "3641":"A place more than 30 miles from Rome. ",
  "3642":"This indicates that the apostle was quite human. Although he had been encouraged by the Lord directly (23:11) and was very courageous throughout his voyage (27:22-25, 33-36), he still took courage at the brothers' warm welcome. It was in his uplifted humanity with its human virtues that Christ with His divine attributes was expressed during his voyage. He magnified Christ continually in his adverse situation (Phil. 1:20). ",
  "3643":"See note 16 in ch. 1. ",
  "3644":"See note 3 in ch. 1. ",
  "3645":"God the Father spoke this word to the stubborn children of Israel in Isa. 6:9-10. God the Son quoted this word to the rejecting Jews in Matt. 13:14-15. And now God the Spirit through the apostle repeated this word as He spoke to the hardhearted people. This indicates that in all the moves of the Divine Trinity the children of Israel were disobedient to the God of grace. Thus, He turned to the Gentiles for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in the spreading of His kingdom for the building up of the churches through the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ (v. 28). ",
  "3646":"I.e., dull. ",
  "3647":"Many MSS omit this verse. ",
  "3648":"During this time the apostle wrote the Epistles to the Colossians (cf. Col. 4:3, 10, 18), Ephesians (cf. Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20), and Philippians (cf. Phil. 1:7, 14, 17), and the Epistle to Philemon (cf. Philem. 1, 9). In Phil. 1:25; 2:24; and Philem. 22, he was expecting to be released from imprisonment. Probably after these two years he was released and visited Ephesus and Macedonia (1 Tim. 1:3). In addition, he visited Crete (Titus 1:5), Nicopolis (Titus 3:12), Troas, and Miletus (2 Tim. 4:13, 20). See note 6 in 2 Tim. 4. ",
  "3649":"I.e., received by welcoming, as in Luke 8:40. ",
  "3650":"This was the end of the apostle's fourth ministry journey, which began in 27:2. ",
  "3651":"The kingdom of God is one of the matters emphasized in this book. Luke's writing here both begins (1:3) and ends with the kingdom of God. <br><br>   This book was not actually ended; rather, it was left open that more may be added. The reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time. Such an evangelistic work for Christ's propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God's New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God (Rom. 8:29) that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body (Rom. 12:5) for the carrying out of God's eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will. This is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow this book. The church produced by Christ's propagation and multiplication is the sphere in which God is expressed and in which He reigns in Christ; hence, the church becomes the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, along with Christ's propagation and multiplication, grows out of and spreads from God's life. Acts is a record of the spreading of Christ; it is also a record of the kingdom of God, because the kingdom of God is the expansion of Christ. The gospel that is widely preached in this book is the very Christ as the gospel (5:42), the gospel of Christ, and it is also the kingdom of God as the gospel (8:12), the gospel of the kingdom of God. The preaching of such a gospel will continue and advance until the whole earth becomes the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15). <br><br>   In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). In Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), spreads Christ into His believers, i.e., works the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed. The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God's full and eternal expression, which will also be God's eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever. This should be the reality and goal of all gospel preaching today. ",
  "3652":"Formerly Saul, who persecuted the believers and devastated the church (Acts 7:58--8:1a; 8:3; 9:1). After he was saved, when he went forth to preach the gospel, his name was changed to Paul (Acts 13:9). ",
  "3653":"A slave, according to ancient custom and law, was one who was purchased by his master and over whom his master had absolute rights, even to the extent of terminating his life. Paul was such a slave of Christ. Verbs formed from this word are used several times throughout this book. One is translated serve as a slave in 6:6 and serve in 7:6, 25; 9:12; 12:11; 14:18; and 16:18. Another is translated enslaved in 6:18, 22. The noun slavery, from the same root as slave, is used in 8:15, 21. <br><br>   Paul's use of this term indicates that he was not a self-appointed apostle or one hired by the Lord; rather, he was one purchased to serve God and minister to His people, not in the natural life but in the regenerated life (see Exo. 12:44; 21:6; note 26 in Matt. 20; note 14 in Matt. 25; and note 17 in Gal. 6). ",
  "3654":"Christ, equal to Messiah in Hebrew, means the anointed One (John 1:41; Dan. 9:26). This book explains how the individual Christ revealed in the four Gospels could become the corporate Christ revealed in Acts, collectively composed of Himself with all the believers. By means of the facts in the Scriptures and the experience in the Holy Spirit, Paul shows us that God's New Testament economy is to make sinners sons of God and members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ to express Him. This book offers a full definition of this, God's goal, unfolding a general sketch and details of both the Christian life and the church life. <br><br>   This book may be divided into eight sections: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation, and conclusion. In these eight sections three major structures can be seen: salvation (1:1--5:11; 9:1--11:36), life (5:12--8:39), and building (12:1--16:27). ",
  "3655":"Jesus, equal to Joshua in Hebrew, means the salvation of Jehovah, or Jehovah the Savior (Matt. 1:21; Num. 13:16; Heb. 4:8). ",
  "3656":"Called includes the thought of being appointed (cf. 1 Cor. 12:28). ",
  "3657":"I.e., a sent one (see note 1 par. 2, in 1 Cor. 9). ",
  "3658":"Being separated includes being chosen (Acts 9:15), being appointed (1 Tim. 2:7), and being sent (Acts 13:2-4). ",
  "3659":"Or, for the gospel; including the proclamation (1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11) and the defense and confirmation (Phil. 1:7) of the gospel. ",
  "3660":"Lit., glad tidings, good news (vv. 9, 16; 2:16; 10:16; 11:28; 15:16, 19; 16:25). The gospel of God, as the subject of this book, concerns Christ as the Spirit living within the believers after His resurrection. This is higher and more subjective than what was presented in the Gospels, which concern Christ only in the flesh as He lived among His disciples after His incarnation but before His death and resurrection. This book, however, reveals that Christ has resurrected and has become the life-giving Spirit (8:9-10). He is no longer merely the Christ outside the believers, but He is now the Christ within them. Hence, the gospel in this book is the gospel of the One who is now indwelling His believers as their subjective Savior. ",
  "3661":"Verses 2-6 may be considered a parenthetical word explaining the gospel of God. ",
  "3662":"The gospel of God was not something added along the way by accident; it was planned and prepared by God in eternity past and promised by God through His prophets in many ways (Gen. 3:15; 22:18; Gal. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 1:2). ",
  "3663":"The Greek words hagios, hagiosune, hagiazo, and hagiasmos, used in this book, are of the same root, which fundamentally means separated, set apart. Hagios is translated holy in v. 2; 5:5; 7:12; 9:1; 11:16; 12:1; 14:17; 15:13, 16; 16:16, and saints in v. 7; 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:15. Hagiosune is translated holiness in v. 4. Hagiazo is a verb used as a participle and is translated sanctified in 15:16. Hagiasmos is translated sanctification in 6:19, 22. Hence, to be holy is to be separated, set apart (to God). The saints are the separated ones, the ones set apart (to God). Holiness is the nature and quality of being holy. Sanctification (to God) is the practical effect, the character in activity, and the consummate state produced by being sanctified. ",
  "3664":"The gospel of God concerns the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. This wonderful person has two natures &#151; the divine nature (v. 4) and the human nature (v. 3), divinity and humanity. ",
  "3665":"Lit., became. ",
  "3666":"Out of, a literal translation of the Greek ek, is used here and again in the next verse, referring to the two sources of Christ's being: one, the seed of David, the other, the resurrection of the dead. ",
  "3667":"The seed of David implies Christ's human nature. By incarnation, the first step of Christ's process, God was brought into humanity. ",
  "3668":"In the Bible flesh is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Bible declares that the Word became flesh (John 1:14). The gospel of God concerns God who became flesh; according to the flesh He became the seed of a man (see note 3 in ch. 8). ",
  "3669":"Or, marked out. Before His incarnation Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). His resurrection was His designation. Now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity. By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship. In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, who possesses both divinity and humanity, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons (8:29-30) &#151; we who have believed in and received His Son. We too will be designated and revealed as the sons of God, as He was in the glory of His resurrection (8:19, 21), and with Him we will express God. ",
  "3670":"This book tells us that God's full salvation is to make sinners (3:23), even His enemies (5:10), the sons of God (8:14). Through resurrection God designated Christ, who became flesh to be the seed of David, as His Son, that His Son, who is the mingling of divinity and humanity, might be the base and pattern for His making sinners His many sons. It is in the resurrection of His Son, i.e., in the resurrected Son, that God is producing many sons (1 Pet. 1:3) as the many brothers of the Firstborn (8:29), who was resurrected from the dead, and as the members of His Firstborn to constitute the Body of His Firstborn (12:5), which is His fullness (Eph. 1:23), His corporate expression. ",
  "3671":"The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit (see notes in Eph. 1:19-22 and note 10 in Phil. 3). ",
  "3672":"The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in v. 3. As the flesh in v. 3 refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ. This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (John 4:24), the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy. ",
  "3673":"See note 2. ",
  "3674":"See note 3. Out of here should be linked to designated in the first part of this verse. Christ was designated the Son of God out of the resurrection of the dead. ",
  "3675":"Grace is God in Christ as life and the life supply (see note 14 in John 1). It affords the apostles salvation and life and becomes the capacity and supply for their apostleship (1 Cor. 15:9-10). ",
  "3676":"I.e., sending forth, or mission. ",
  "3677":"God's unique commandment in this age, the age of grace, is that man should believe into His Son, the Lord Jesus. Whoever believes into Him will be saved; whoever does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into Him (John 3:18). The Holy Spirit convicts the world of the sin of not believing into the Lord (John 16:8-9), of not obeying God's unique commandment. When we believe into the Lord, we have the obedience of faith, and the result is grace and peace (v. 7). ",
  "3678":"In the New Testament the complete gospel according to God's New Testament revelation is the content of the faith, with the two natures of Christ, who is both God and man, and the redemptive work accomplished through His death and resurrection as its center (see note 1 par. 2, in 1 Tim. 1). To obey this faith is to turn from all pagan religions and philosophies unto this faith, believing and receiving it. ",
  "3679":"Christ's name denotes His person, Himself. On behalf of His name denotes for Him, for His sake, for His interests. ",
  "3680":"God calls us for the purpose of bringing us into Christ that we may belong to Him. All the fullness of God is in Christ (Col. 2:9; 1:19). When we are brought into Him and belong to Him, we partake of all the fullness of God. Of His fullness we have received all that is of God, even grace upon grace (John 1:16). This matter is covered in detail in the first eight chapters of this book (cf. 8:9). ",
  "3681":"See note 2. ",
  "3682":"Grace is God in Christ as our enjoyment (see John 1:14, 16-17; notes 2 and 17 in Rom. 5); it is the source. Peace is the result of our enjoyment of God in Christ (John 16:33); it is the issue. ",
  "3683":"The Greek word means serve in worship; it is used in Matt. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:3; Phil. 3:3; and Luke 2:37. Paul considered his preaching of the gospel a worship and service to God, not merely a work. ",
  "3684":"Not the Spirit of God but Paul's regenerated spirit. The spirit is different from the heart, soul, mind, emotion, will, or natural life. Christ and the Spirit are with the believers in their regenerated human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). In this book Paul stressed that whatever we are (2:29; 8:5-6, 9), whatever we have (8:10, 16), and whatever we do toward God (v. 9; 7:6; 8:4, 13; 12:11) must be in this spirit. Paul served God in his regenerated spirit by the indwelling Christ, the life-giving Spirit, not in his soul by the power and ability of the soul. This is the first important item in his preaching of the gospel. ",
  "3685":"Or, comforted. ",
  "3686":"See note 11 in 1 Cor. 14. ",
  "3687":"Denoting a powerful force that can break through any obstacle. This power is the resurrected Christ Himself, who is the life-giving Spirit, and it is unto salvation to everyone who believes. ",
  "3688":"To save the believing ones not only from God's condemnation and from eternal perdition but also from their natural life and their self, that they may be sanctified, transformed, and built up with others as the one Body of Christ to be His fullness and expression (Eph. 1:23). ",
  "3689":"In John 3:16 God's love is the source and motive of God's salvation. In Eph. 2:5, 8 God's grace is the means of God's salvation. Here God's righteousness is the power of God's salvation. God's righteousness, which is solid and steadfast, is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14) and the base on which His kingdom is built (Rom. 14:17). Legally, both love and grace can fluctuate, but righteousness cannot. It is even more so with God's righteousness. It is God's righteousness, not ours, that is revealed in the gospel of God. Hence, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. ",
  "3690":"Out of faith indicates that faith is the source and the foundation of the revelation of God's righteousness; to faith indicates that faith is the receiver and container that receives and retains God's righteousness. If we have this faith, God's righteousness will be made visible to us and will be laid hold of by us. ",
  "3691":"The righteousness of God justifies us that we may have God's life (5:18) and live by it. In this way this life will sanctify and transform us thoroughly. This book covers mainly our being justified (1:1--5:11; 9:1--11:36), our having life (5:12--8:39), and our living properly by this life (12:1--16:27). Since this verse also stresses these three points, it may be considered an abstract of the entire book. ",
  "3692":"See note 20 in Gal. 2. ",
  "3693":"This book begins with man's fall (in contrast to Ephesians, which begins with God's selection and predestination in eternity past); continues through Christ's redemption, God's justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification; and, finally, touches the mystery of God in eternity past (16:25). ",
  "3694":"In the preceding verse the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel to faith; here, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. This shows a contrast between the revelation of God's righteousness and the revelation of God's wrath. Originally, the wrath of God was revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. However, since the gospel of God has come, the scene has changed. Now the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel to our faith. ",
  "3695":"Implying against, or in opposition to. ",
  "3696":"To hold down means to suppress. From the beginning mankind did not respect the truth of God but suppressed it unrighteously. ",
  "3697":"The truth here refers to the first true thing, the first reality, concerning man and God in the universe. This reality is the sure fact that God and His existence are proved by the creation, and it is the definite fact that men, being without excuse, can know God by the creation. This great reality, this great truth, should cause men to know God and thereby to glorify Him and thank Him (v. 21). However, instead of dealing properly with this reality, this truth, according to righteousness, in which God delights, men held down the truth in unrighteousness, which God hates, and did not approve of knowing God (v. 28). Therefore, they despised and rejected God, changing the glory of God into idols (vv. 21-23) and casting off self-restraint to fall without limit (vv. 24-32), so that they were given up, abandoned, by God (vv. 24, 26, 28). ",
  "3698":"Or, among. ",
  "3699":"Gk. theiotes, denoting God's attributes, which are the special features, the characteristics, as the outward manifestations of God's nature or substance. It is different from theotes in Col. 2:9, which denotes God's Godhead and person. The characteristics of God's nature can be verified through the created things; however, the created things cannot manifest God's Godhead and person. Only the living person of Jesus Christ, the Word who is God and who declares God (John 1:1, 18), can express God's Godhead and person, that is, the very God, God Himself. Here, in this chapter, the apostle Paul speaks of the created things verifying God's existence, but what is verified are only the attributes and characteristics of God. In Col. 2:9 he speaks of Christ as the embodiment of God, and what is expressed is the Godhead and God's person, that is, God Himself. ",
  "3700":"Man can perceive the invisible things of God by observing the visible things created by Him. Both the eternal power of God and the divine characteristics that express God's intrinsic nature are manifested in God's creation. For example, the abundance of light in the universe shows that light is a divine characteristic, a divine attribute of the divine nature (James 1:17). The same is true of beauty and life. ",
  "3701":"In this chapter Paul's presentation of God's creation and man's step-by-step fall is undoubtedly based on the historical facts as recorded in Gen. 1--19 and in subsequent books of the Old Testament. First, vv. 19-20 speak concerning God's creation; then vv. 21-25 cover the fall of Adam and progress through the age of the flood to the worshipping of idols at Babel. Verses 26-27 progress further, from Babel to the shameful lusts of Sodom, and vv. 28-32 go on from Sodom to every kind of wickedness in the Old Testament time. ",
  "3702":"Vain reasonings are the basic element in the daily life of fallen mankind. See note 17 in Eph. 4. ",
  "3703":"To change the glory of God into anything else is to forsake Him and to make an idol. ",
  "3704":"The same expression is used also in vv. 26 and 28. The result of man's giving up God is man's being given up by Him. Those who give up God force God to give them up. According to this chapter God gives people up to three things: uncleanness (v. 24), passions of dishonor (v. 26), and a disapproved mind (v. 28). The consequence of such a giving up is fornication (vv. 24, 26-27), which violates a governing and controlling principle and brings in confusion. Every kind of evil issues from this fornication (vv. 29-32). ",
  "3705":"The truth of God is the reality of God. God is true and real. What He is, is a reality. But the idols are false. Whatever they are is a lie. ",
  "3706":"Or, righteous requirement, as in 8:4; that is, the requirement of God's righteous will. Hence, this phrase also refers to the judgment that is out of God's will (Rev. 15:4), or to statutes with judgments, that is, ordinances (2:26; Luke 1:6), or to the righteous act that meets God's requirement (5:18). ",
  "3707":"Meaning to pass judgment, to criticize. So in subsequent verses. ",
  "3708":"Referring to God's eternal judgment, which will be carried out mainly at the great white throne, as revealed in Rev. 20:11-15. See note 10 in ch. 14. ",
  "3709":"Truth here and in vv. 8, 20 denotes the reality revealed through the creation and through the Bible concerning God, the universe, man, the relationship between man and God, the relationships among men, and man's obligation to God. It also refers to the actual situation and condition of man, and it may be the terms of God's judgment upon man, as indicated in vv. 6-15. According to these terms God will execute His judgment righteously. ",
  "3710":"See note 2. So in vv. 5, 16. ",
  "3711":"Verses 7-10 give the basic terms of God's eternal judgment. ",
  "3712":"See note 2. ",
  "3713":"Lit., in law; i.e., in the sphere of law. ",
  "3714":"The nature of man, as created by God, was originally good and corresponded with God and with His law. Although it was poisoned by the fall, this good nature remains within man. Hence, if anyone lives according to his nature and does by his nature the things of the law, the evil in him will be restricted. ",
  "3715":"Man's conscience corresponds with the God-created human nature and enables man to know what God justifies and what He condemns. ",
  "3716":"In this section, which specifically deals with God's condemnation on the religious, Paul first points out the pitiful condition of the Jews, who represent the religious people. They have only the vanity of their religious rituals, letters, and knowledge; they do not have God as their reality. ",
  "3717":"In the Jewish religion God is known only outwardly and objectively, not inwardly and subjectively. This shows the vanity of human religion. ",
  "3718":"Or, prove the things that differ. ",
  "3719":"The same Greek word as for little children in Eph. 4:14 and child in Gal. 4:1. ",
  "3720":"That the religious people practice the same evils as the unreligious exposes the vanity of their religion. See note 17. ",
  "3721":"Or, requirements. ",
  "3722":"Lit., For the Jew in what is manifest is not a Jew; neither is the circumcision in what is manifest in the flesh circumcision. ",
  "3723":"Any religious practice, such as circumcision, that is merely an outward form is not real. See note 17. ",
  "3724":"Lit., But the Jew in what is hidden is a Jew. ",
  "3725":"I.e., based on. Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must be in spirit. This will keep us from the vanity of religion. See note 9 in ch. 1. The reality of all spiritual things depends on the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit. Hence, the reality of all spiritual matters depends on our spirit, not on anything apart from our spirit. Whatever is in us is vanity unless it is in our spirit. Everything that God is to us is in our spirit. ",
  "3726":"Lit., out of. ",
  "3727":"Lit., May it not happen. So throughout this Epistle. ",
  "3728":"God must first convince us of His righteousness before we can repent and believe into Him. Thus, He is declared righteous by us before we are declared righteous by Him. ",
  "3729":"In Greek the same word as for truth (reality). The word here and in 15:8 denotes genuineness, sincerity, honesty, faithfulness, and trustworthiness as one of God's virtues (see note 6 item 7, in 1 John 1). ",
  "3730":"The eternal judgment. See note 2 in ch. 2. ",
  "3731":"Or, kindness. ",
  "3732":"When we were sinners, we did not know the way of peace. Now, however, we have peace toward God (5:1); that is, we are at peace with God. ",
  "3733":"God's purpose in giving the law was to expose man, to subdue man, and to guard or keep God's chosen ones for Christ that they may be led to Christ (see notes on Gal. 3:23-24). ",
  "3734":"God's righteousness, which is revealed in the gospel (1:17), is the basis and foundation of His dispensing Himself into man in His New Testament economy. This righteousness has nothing to do with the law in His Old Testament economy (see Phil. 3:9 and notes there). ",
  "3735":"See note 17 in ch. 1. So in the next verse. ",
  "3736":"The Jews sought the righteousness of God by keeping the law. However, they did not attain to it, for out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before God (v. 20). But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been manifested to us through faith in Christ (1:17). ",
  "3737":"Or, faith in Jesus Christ. This faith refers to the faith of Jesus Christ in us, which has become the faith by which we believe in Him, as in v. 26; Gal. 2:16, 20; 3:22; Eph. 3:12; and Phil. 3:9. <br><br>   Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him. <br><br>   In God's New Testament economy, God desires that man believe in Jesus, who is God incarnate. If man does not believe in Him, he commits the unique sin before God (John 16:9). However, if man believes in Him, he is righteous to the uttermost before God, and God reckons this faith as his righteousness. At the same time, this faith brings its object, that is, this One who is God incarnate, into those who believe in Him. He is God's righteousness, and God has given Him as righteousness to those who are indwelt by Him (Jer. 23:6). All this is out of, and depends on, the faith that is in Him and of Him (Heb. 12:2). ",
  "3738":"God's glory is God expressed. Whenever God is expressed, His glory is seen. Man was made by God in His image that man might express Him for His glory. But man has sinned and has contradicted the holiness and righteousness of God. Instead of expressing God, man expresses sin and his sinful self. Hence, man falls short of God's glory. This falling short of God's glory and expression is sin. Sinners are not only under the requirements of God's holiness and righteousness but also under the demand of God's glory. All have offended God's holy being and have broken God's righteous law, and all are short of God's glory. Therefore, all are under God's condemnation. ",
  "3739":"Justification is God's action whereby He approves people according to His standard of righteousness. God can do this on the basis of the redemption of Christ. ",
  "3740":"Since Christ has paid the price for our sins and in His redemption has fulfilled all God's requirements on us, God, because He is just, must justify us freely. Such justification is by the grace of God, not by our works. ",
  "3741":"To redeem is to purchase back at a cost. We originally belonged to God but became lost through sin. The requirements of God's holiness, righteousness, and glory were so great upon us that it was impossible for us to fulfill them. However, God paid the price for us through Christ, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. Christ died on the cross to redeem us (Gal. 3:13; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18); His blood obtained eternal redemption for us (1 Pet. 1:18-19). ",
  "3742":"In the Old Testament, the propitiation place, the lid of the ark, as a type, was hidden in the Holy of Holies; in the New Testament, Christ as the reality of the propitiation place is openly set forth before all men. ",
  "3743":"The propitiation place is typified in Exo. 25:17 by the sin-covering lid on the ark. The ark was the place where God met with people. In the ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God. However, by the lid of the ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Propitiation, the entire situation on the sinner's side was fully covered. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God taking away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God (John 1:29), thus satisfying all the requirements of God's holiness, righteousness, and glory and appeasing the relationship between man and God. Hence, God could pass over the people's sins that had previously occurred. And, in order to show forth His righteousness, He had to do this. This is what this verse refers to. <br><br>   The Hebrew word for the lid of the ark is kapporeth, from a root meaning to cover. In the Septuagint this word is translated hilasterion, which means the place of propitiation (implying to forgive and to give mercy &#151; the word rendered propitious in Heb. 8:12 is the root of hilasterion, and the word rendered propitiated in Luke 18:13 is derived from this root). The King James Version adopts the rendering \"mercy seat,\" referring to the place where God grants mercy to man. In Heb. 9:5 Paul also used hilasterion for the lid of the ark. Here, in Rom. 3:25, the same word, hilasterion, is used to show that the lid of the ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God. <br><br>   In addition to hilasterion, two other words derived from the same Greek word as hilasterion are used in the New Testament to show how Christ took away man's sin to appease the relationship between man and God. One is hilaskomai (Heb. 2:17), which means to propitiate, that is, to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other's demand; the other is hilasmos (1 John 2:2; 4:10), which means that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Christ made propitiation for our sins (Heb. 2:17); hence, He has become that which propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice, between us and God (1 John 2:2; 4:10), and He has also become the place, as typified by the lid of the ark (Heb. 9:5), where we enjoy propitiation before God and where God gives grace to us. ",
  "3744":"During the Old Testament time, the sins of the people were not taken away but were only covered with the blood of the animal sacrifices, which were types of Christ. God passed over these covered sins until Christ came. He was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world (John 1:29). By His death on the cross and the shedding of His blood for redemption, He carried away all the sins that had been previously covered and passed over. In passing over their sins, God demonstrated His righteousness to the Old Testament saints. ",
  "3745":"God's justifying the believers is with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness to those in the New Testament time who are of the faith of Jesus. ",
  "3746":"Or, faith in Jesus. See note 22. ",
  "3747":"Lit., It is completely shut out. ",
  "3748":"Faith is the source out of which the circumcision, who already have the position as God's people, may be justified by God; hence, their justification is out of faith. But as to the uncircumcision, who are positionally far away and are not God's people, faith is the way for them to reach the position where they can be justified by God; hence, their justification is through faith. ",
  "3749":"After dealing in ch. 3 with the objective, positional justification accomplished by the death of Christ, Paul in this chapter shows the subjective, dispositional justification carried out by the resurrection of Christ. He uses Abraham as the example to show that adequate, living justification is God's deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself, so that they place their full trust in Him rather than in themselves. In Gen. 15 Abraham's being justified by God was not related to sin; rather, it was for the gaining of a seed to produce a kingdom that will inherit the world (v. 13). Likewise, this chapter indicates that justification is not merely for man to be delivered out of God's condemnation, but even more for God to gain many sons (8:29-30) to constitute the one Body of Christ (ch. 12) as the kingdom of God (14:17) for the fulfillment of His purpose. The objective, positional justification covered in ch. 3 is related to redemption, through which man may be reconciled to God; the subjective, dispositional justification covered in ch. 4 is related to life, through which men may become heirs for the fulfillment of God's purpose. This requires that man's flesh and his natural ability be cut off, circumcised. ",
  "3750":"Abraham is the forefather of all believers, of both the uncircumcision who have the same faith and the circumcision who walk in the steps of the same faith. ",
  "3751":"This refers to Abraham's doing something for God by himself, as seen in his attempts to have God accept the fruit of his efforts (first Lot, then Eliezer, then Ishmael, who was born through Hagar) as God's promised seed. The result of Abraham's being justified, however, was that he eventually stopped his own work for God. This was signified by circumcision (v. 11), which is the cutting off of the flesh. Hence, circumcision became God's constant reminder to Abraham to stop his own doing and live by faith in God. Justification has nothing to do with the works and accomplishments of the flesh. ",
  "3752":"Believing God was Abraham's spontaneous reaction to God's repeated appearing to him. God appeared to Abraham a number of times (Gen. 12:1-3, 7; 13:14-17; 15:1-7; ch. 18; Acts 7:2), each time transfusing something of His glory, something of Himself, into Abraham. Hence, Abraham's believing was actually the springing up within him of the very element that God had transfused into him. God's reaction to Abraham's believing was to justify him, that is, to account him righteous. This accounting was not out of works but was based on his believing God. ",
  "3753":"The natural man always works for God in order to receive compensation (wages). With the natural man there is no grace, faith, or enjoyment (see Exo. 12:45). ",
  "3754":"God's justification is not a reward (wages) for our good works (labor); it is grace freely given to us through Christ's redemption. If God's justification were based on our good works, or if it required our good works, then it would be the wages we earn for our good works; that is, it would be something owed to us, not something freely given by God. Since God's justification is reckoned according to His grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise, grace is no longer grace (11:6). Our works can by no means replace God's grace; God's grace must be absolute. ",
  "3755":"Circumcision was not the reason that Abraham was justified; rather, it was the outward sign and confirmation that God had already justified him. It denoted the cutting off of the natural strength by which he had produced Ishmael in his effort to please God. Abraham was already justified before he was circumcised, and God had already confirmed His covenant with him in Gen. 15. Circumcision was to confirm the covenant from Abraham's side, to serve as a constant reminder to him that he should no longer use his natural strength and energy to please God. ",
  "3756":"See note 13. ",
  "3757":"The Greek word means to walk in a regulated, definite way (see notes 25 in Gal. 5 and 16 in Phil. 3). Here it refers to walking in the steps by observing the elements of the faith. If one walks in the steps of Abraham's faith, Abraham becomes the father of circumcision to him, and this one enters into a life in which he does not trust in himself but in God, with the result that he is justified subjectively and thus becomes His genuine heir. ",
  "3758":"Justification is for God's chosen ones to inherit the world that they may exercise God's dominion on earth (Gen. 1:26). ",
  "3759":"The law was God's temporary economy (dispensation) for man in the Old Testament, since it was added temporarily because of man's transgressions (Gal. 3:19); the faith is God's eternal economy (dispensation) for man in the New Testament, because it is based on God's eternal plan (cf. note 4 in 1 Tim. 1). In the Old Testament God dealt with man according to the law. If, according to that dispensation of God, man would have done what God commanded in the law, he would have obtained righteousness, that is, the righteousness of the law (9:31), the righteousness which is out of the law (10:5; Phil. 3:9). In the New Testament God deals with man according to the faith. If, according to this dispensation of God, man believes in Christ, the One in whom God has ordained that man should believe (1 John 3:23), he will obtain righteousness, that is, the righteousness of faith (v. 11), the righteousness which is out of faith (9:30; 10:6). The faith, which is ordained by God in the New Testament economy and which replaces the law of the Old Testament, did not come until the New Testament time (Gal. 3:23, 25). This faith, which replaces the law, is objective to us. When according to this objective faith we believe subjectively in Christ, in whom God intended that we believe, we receive the righteousness of faith. This righteousness is the Christ whom we possess &#151; whom we receive by our subjective believing according to the objective faith ordained by God &#151; as God's righteousness received by us (1 Cor. 1:30). ",
  "3760":"As the father of all those called by God, Abraham was the first of a new race chosen by God. We were born into the fallen Adamic race, but we have been reborn into the called-out Abrahamic race. Whoever is of faith, as Abraham was, is a member of this new race and a son of Abraham (Gal. 3:7). ",
  "3761":"Abraham believed God regarding two things: (1) the birth of Isaac, which is related to the God who \"calls the things not being as being,\" and (2) the offering up and the gaining back of Isaac, which is related to the God who \"gives life to the dead.\" Abraham believed such a God and applied Him to his situation. Because Abraham had such faith, he believed God's seemingly impossible word concerning the birth of Isaac, and he also immediately obeyed God's commandment to offer Isaac, believing that God would raise him from the dead (Heb. 11:17-19). ",
  "3762":"This is God's great power of resurrection. This great power enables us to eliminate death and overcome all that belongs to death. Abraham experienced this great power of resurrection when he offered Isaac according to God's command. ",
  "3763":"This is God's mighty power of creation. As the creating God, He needs no material to work with; He can create something out of nothing simply by speaking: \"For he spake, and it was done\" (Psa. 33:9). ",
  "3764":"Lit., on. Abraham, as the example of one who is justified out of faith, lived by the things hoped for (see note 1 in Heb. 11). ",
  "3765":"This indicates the termination of Abraham's natural strength. This termination is related to God's justifying him subjectively. ",
  "3766":"The faith that is accounted to us as righteousness is our believing on God, who righteously judged Christ for our sins, righteously put Him to death in our place, and righteously raised Him from the dead. ",
  "3767":"The death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God's righteous requirements; hence, we are justified by God through His death (3:24). His resurrection proves that God's requirements were satisfied by His death for us, that we are justified by God because of His death, and that in Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. Furthermore, as the resurrected One, He is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. ",
  "3768":"Our journey into God through our being justified out of faith has not yet been completed; thus, Paul used the word toward, not with. Grace is for our standing (v. 2), and peace is for our walk. ",
  "3769":"The very faith that justifies us and cuts off the flesh with its natural energy and effort also gives us access into God's grace. If we remain in the flesh with its natural effort, we will neither know nor enjoy the grace of God; but if we live by faith, we will enter into the full enjoyment of God's grace. ",
  "3770":"Grace is the Triune God Himself, processed that we may enter into Him and enjoy Him. Grace here, in the deepest sense, is the Triune God as our enjoyment. It is more than unmerited favor and more than mere outward blessing. We are not merely under God's blessing; we are in His grace (see note 2). ",
  "3771":"Faith first gives us access into grace, then, a solid standing in grace. ",
  "3772":"Boast in Greek also has the meaning of exult. This indicates our enjoyment of God. (So in the next verse.) ",
  "3773":"Our hope is that we will be brought into the glory of God, that is, into His expression. This will be fully realized in the coming millennial kingdom, where Christ will be revealed as our glory. Today we are in the hope of this coming glory (see note 1 in Heb. 11). ",
  "3774":"Tribulations are part of the \"all things\" in 8:28 that God causes to work together for good that we might be sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of His Son, who has entered into glory. Because of this, we can receive tribulations as the sweet visitation and incarnation of grace and thereby boast in them. Through tribulations the killing effect of the cross of Christ on our natural being is applied in us by the Holy Spirit, making the way for the God of resurrection to add Himself to us (see 2 Cor. 4:16-18). ",
  "3775":"Meaning persistence. Persistence is the product of patience plus suffering. ",
  "3776":"Approvedness is an approved quality or attribute resulting from the enduring and experiencing of tribulation and testing. ",
  "3777":"The love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16). God has poured out this love in our hearts with the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us, as the motivating power within us, that we may more than conquer in all our tribulations (see note 39 in ch. 8). Therefore, when we endure any kind of tribulation, we are not put to shame. ",
  "3778":"I.e., impotent; unable to please God. ",
  "3779":"Propitiation and forgiveness of sins are adequate for a sinner but not for an enemy. An enemy needs reconciliation, which includes propitiation and forgiveness but goes further, even to resolving the conflict between two parties. Our being reconciled to God is based on Christ's redemption and was accomplished through God's justification (3:24; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). Reconciliation is the result of being justified out of faith. ",
  "3780":"Verse 10 of this chapter points out that God's full salvation revealed in this book consists of two sections: one section is the redemption accomplished for us by Christ's death, and the other section is the saving afforded us by Christ's life. The first four chapters of this book discourse comprehensively regarding the redemption accomplished by Christ's death, whereas the last twelve chapters speak in detail concerning the saving afforded by Christ's life. Before 5:11, Paul shows us that we are saved because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God. However, we have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively; sanctification, transformation, and conformation, which are accomplished within us by the working of Christ's life, save us subjectively. Objective redemption redeems us positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; subjective salvation saves us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life. ",
  "3781":"Being reconciled to God through Christ's death is an accomplished matter, but being saved in His life from so many negative things unto glorification is a daily matter. ",
  "3782":"To be saved in Christ's life is to be saved in Christ Himself as life. He dwells in us, and we are organically one with Him. By the growth of His life in us, we will enjoy His full salvation to the uttermost. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation are for the purpose of bringing us into union with Christ so that He can save us in His life unto glorification (8:30). ",
  "3783":"Implying resurrection. After death is spoken of in the first part of this verse, life is mentioned. Christ died that He might be our life in resurrection. We have been saved by Christ's death from God's eternal judgment and eternal punishment, but we are still being saved by Christ's life in His resurrection. The life here, the power in 1:16, and the Spirit in ch. 8 refer to different aspects of the processed Triune God. ",
  "3784":"To boast in God means to have God as our boast and our exultation, indicating that God is our enjoyment and our rejoicing. See note 2. It is in boasting, in exulting, and in enjoying in this way that we are being saved in the life of Christ. ",
  "3785":"I.e., Adam, the first man, the father of the entire human race, who brought in death through sin. In contrast to Adam is Christ, the second man (1 Cor. 15:47), who brought in life through righteousness (vv. 17-18). ",
  "3786":"Up to v. 11 sins (plural) have been dealt with. From v. 12 sin (singular) is dealt with. It seems that in chs. 5--8 sin is personified. Sin is not merely an action; it is like a person who can enter (v. 12), reign (v. 21), lord it over people (6:14), deceive and kill people (7:11), and dwell in people and cause them to do things against their will (7:17, 20). It is quite alive (7:9) and exceedingly active; hence, it must be the evil nature of Satan, the evil one, who, having injected himself into man through Adam's fall, has now become the very sinful nature dwelling, acting, and working in fallen man. This indwelling, personified sinful nature is the root of all the outward sinful acts. ",
  "3787":"Or, people of the world; referring to mankind (John 1:29; 3:16). ",
  "3788":"Death is the ultimate result of man's fall. Man's spirit was deadened first, and eventually his body also died. Death and sin cannot be separated; where one is, the other will be found. Furthermore, death is not only a physical suffering in the future; it is something in which man is involved daily. ",
  "3789":"Sin existed before the law was given, but it was not manifested to man or charged to his account by God before that time. ",
  "3790":"Death is mentioned many times in chs. 5--8 (vv. 12, 14, 17, 21; 6:9, 16, 21, 23; 7:5, 10, 13, 24; 8:2, 6, 38). Life also is mentioned repeatedly in these chapters (vv. 10, 17-18, 21; 6:4, 22-23; 7:10; 8:2, 6, 10-11, 38). These two key words form two contrasting lines through chs. 5--8, the line of life and the line of death, showing that man is at the center of a triangular situation between God and Satan, life and death. Thus, chs. 5--8 of Romans can be called the kernel of the Bible, showing its entire theme in a concrete and detailed way. ",
  "3791":"From Adam to Moses was the dispensation before law (without law); from Moses to Christ (John 1:17) was the dispensation of law; from Christ's first coming to the restoration of all things (Acts 3:20-21) is the dispensation of grace; and from Christ's second coming to the end of the millennium (Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6) is the dispensation of the kingdom. These dispensations are used by God to accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation. ",
  "3792":"In this chapter the words transgression, offense, and disobedience all refer to the fall of Adam, which consisted in his leaving life and choosing death. Adam forsook the tree of life, which denotes God as life, to pursue the tree of knowledge, which signifies Satan as the source of death (Gen. 2:8-9, 17; 3:1-7). ",
  "3793":"Adam was the head of the old collective man (mankind). Whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind. In this respect he is a type of Christ, who is the Head of the new corporate man, the church (Eph. 2:15-16). Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is participated in by all the members of His Body, the church (Eph. 1:22-23). ",
  "3794":"Christ our Redeemer was fully a man and was fully God as well (see 9:5). Grace with all its gifts abounded in the humanity of Christ. ",
  "3795":"Grace not only abounds (v. 17) and multiplies (superabounds &#151; v. 20) but also reigns (v. 21). Only a living person can reign. ",
  "3796":"Referring to the gift of righteousness, which we have received (v. 17). This indicates that the righteousness given to us by God is a gift. ",
  "3797":"Those who receive the abundant grace are able to reign in life, for life issues out of the abundance of grace. ",
  "3798":"The gift of righteousness erases judgment. Judgment comes from sin, but righteousness comes from grace. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result. Subjective righteousness (4:25b) comes from grace (vv. 17, 19), and grace comes from objective righteousness (vv. 1-2). ",
  "3799":"The life we have received does not merely save us from a few things; rather, it enthrones us as kings to reign over all things. This is much higher than being saved in life. We have received righteousness objectively, but we still need to continually receive the abundance of grace so that we can reign in life subjectively. This reigning is defined in chs. 6--16; all the matters expounded there are the issue not of our endeavoring but of our receiving the abundance of grace. ",
  "3800":"Life here, and in vv. 10, 18, 21; 6:4; and 8:2, 6, 10, refers to the eternal, divine, uncreated life of God (zoe), which is Christ Himself as life to us (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4). It is different from both our physical life (bio &#151; Luke 8:14) and our soulish life ( psuche &#151; Matt. 16:25-26; John 12:25). This eternal life of God is the main element of the divine grace that has been given to us, and in this eternal life we can reign. ",
  "3801":"Christ's righteous act of dying on the cross resulted in justification of life. Verse 21 says that grace reigns through righteousness unto life. These two verses show that life comes as the result of righteousness (see 8:10). ",
  "3802":"Life is the goal of God's salvation; thus, justification is \"of life.\" Justification is not an end in itself; it is for life. Through justification we have come up to the standard of God's righteousness and correspond with it, so that now He can impart His life to us. Justification changes our outward position; life changes our inward disposition. Justification unto life indicates that life is the focus of this chapter and that the organic union of life is an issue of justification. ",
  "3803":"Whether we are sinners or are righteous depends not on our actions but on our inward constitution. Through his fall Adam received an element that was not created by God. This was the satanic nature, which became the constituting essence and main element of fallen man. It is this constituting essence and element that constituted all men sinners. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. Whether we do good or evil, in Adam we have been constituted sinners. This is due to our inward element, not our outward actions. <br><br>   In contrast, Christ constitutes us righteous. When He, the living God, comes into our being as grace, we are constituted righteous. He becomes the constituting essence and element in us that can transform us from sinners into sons of God. He alone is able to accomplish such a reconstituting work. ",
  "3804":"Christ's death on the cross was the highest expression of His obedience and was regarded by God a righteous act (v. 18; see Phil. 2:8). ",
  "3805":"The law causes sin to abound, that is, to become evident and recognizable to man. In this way man's sinfulness is fully exposed. ",
  "3806":"Sin reigns by the authority of death and brings in death by its reign. Thus, a sinner must die. ",
  "3807":"Righteousness is the footing, the base, and the means for God to dispense Himself to us as grace. This righteousness gives us the ground to claim Christ as our grace. By giving grace to us, God manifests His righteousness (see 1:17). Furthermore, the power of this grace operates in us and produces subjective righteousness, making us right with God, with others, and even with ourselves; and it not only subdues sin but also overcomes Satan and death in our being. Thus grace reigns through righteousness, resulting in eternal life. ",
  "3808":"Baptism is not a form or a ritual; it signifies our identification with Christ. Through baptism we are immersed into Christ, taking Him as our realm, that we may be united with Him as one in His death and resurrection. ",
  "3809":"We were born in the sphere of Adam, the first man (1 Cor. 15:45, 47), but through baptism we have been transferred into the sphere of Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:27), the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). ",
  "3810":"When we are baptized into Christ, we are baptized into His death. His death has separated us from the world and the satanic power of darkness and has terminated our natural life, our old nature, our self, our flesh, and even our entire history. ",
  "3811":"Our old man has been crucified with Christ (v. 6), and it has been buried with Him through baptism into death. In the natural realm, a person first dies and then is buried; but Paul's word indicates that in the spiritual realm, we are first buried and then die. We do not die directly; we enter into Christ's death through baptism. ",
  "3812":"Christ and His death are one. Apart from Him we could never be baptized into His death, for the element of His effective death is found only in Him, the resurrected, all-inclusive One. ",
  "3813":"Referring to the manifestation of divinity. ",
  "3814":"After baptism we become a new person in resurrection. Resurrection is not only a future state; it is also a present process. To walk in newness of life means to live today in the realm of resurrection and to reign in life. This kind of living deals with all that is of Adam in us until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ (8:29). ",
  "3815":"This denotes an organic union in which growth takes place, so that one partakes of the life and characteristics of the other. In the organic union with Christ, whatever Christ passed through has become our history. His death and resurrection are now ours because we are in Him and are organically joined to Him. This is grafting (11:24). Such a grafting (1) discharges all our negative elements, (2) resurrects our God-created faculties, (3) uplifts our faculties, (4) enriches our faculties, and (5) saturates our entire being to transform us. ",
  "3816":"The likeness of Christ's death is the baptism mentioned in v. 4; the likeness of Christ's resurrection is the newness of life mentioned in v. 4. ",
  "3817":"This does not refer to a future, objective resurrection but to the present process of growth. When we were baptized, we grew together with Christ in the likeness of His death; now, through His death we are growing into His resurrection. Just as the element of Christ's death is found only in Him, so the element of Christ's resurrection is found only in Christ Himself. He Himself is resurrection (John 11:25). After experiencing a proper baptism, we continue to grow in and with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, to walk in newness of life. ",
  "3818":"In Greek, knowing here refers to the outward, objective knowledge; knowing in v. 9 and know in v. 16 refer to the inward, subjective consciousness. ",
  "3819":"Referring to the natural life in our soul. The old man is our very being, which was created by God but became fallen through sin, and it is the same as the \"I\" in Gal. 2:20. It is not the soul itself but the life of the soul, which has been counted by God as hopeless and has been put on the cross and crucified with Christ. Formerly, our soul acted as an independent person, with the old man as its life and personality; now, since the old man has been crucified, our soul should act only as an organ of Christ and should be under the control of our spirit, having Christ as its life. ",
  "3820":"See note 24 in Gal. 5. ",
  "3821":"The body indwelt, occupied, corrupted, possessed, utilized, and enslaved by sin, so that it does sinful things. This body of sin is very active and full of strength to commit sins; it differs from \"the body of this death\" mentioned in 7:24, which is weak and powerless in the things of God. The body of sin is not the sinning person but the sinning instrument utilized by the old man to express himself by committing sins, thereby causing the body of sin to become the flesh. Hence, the body of sin in this verse and the flesh of sin in 8:3 refer to the same thing. ",
  "3822":"Or, unemployed, jobless, inactive. Because the old man has been crucified with Christ, the body that had been utilized by him as the instrument for sinning now has nothing to do; it is unemployed, jobless. Thus, we have been freed from sin (vv. 18-22) and no longer need to be under the bondage of sin to serve sin as slaves. ",
  "3823":"Both the nature of sin with its power and its pain, and the sinful acts with their history and their judgment. ",
  "3824":"This again shows our organic union with Christ in His death and His resurrection. ",
  "3825":"In His resurrection Christ is transcendent over corruption and death. Since we are one with Him in this resurrection, we also are transcendent over corruption and death. ",
  "3826":"Or, consider. Reckoning is not a technique but a spontaneous believing, a spontaneous considering, produced by seeing the facts that are revealed in this chapter. We must see and believe the facts, recognize them, and, according to them, reckon ourselves dead to sin and living to God. <br><br>   Reckoning, however, is not the cause of death and cannot by itself execute the death of Christ within us. Only by the enjoyment of the Spirit, who is revealed in ch. 8, will we experience Christ's all-inclusive and effective death and His resurrection and its power, which are revealed here in this chapter. This chapter shows the objective facts accomplished by Christ for us; these need our believing and reckoning. Chapter 8 shows the subjective work of the Spirit in making the facts accomplished by Christ real in our practical experience; this needs our fellowship with and enjoyment of Him. The facts spoken of in this chapter can become our experience only in the Spirit revealed in ch. 8. ",
  "3827":"This is to reject sin and to cooperate with the Spirit of God. ",
  "3828":"Lit., its (referring to body). ",
  "3829":"Presenting ourselves and our members to God is the result of seeing the facts of our having been crucified and resurrected with Christ and of reckoning ourselves dead and living according to these facts. ",
  "3830":"Or, instruments. Our members are not merely instruments but are weapons of righteousness to fight the battle in the war between righteousness and unrighteousness. ",
  "3831":"Sin, here personified, lords it over us through the lusts of our body (v. 12). ",
  "3832":"That we are not under the law but under grace is the reason sin cannot lord it over us. This gives us the position to reject sin. Sin no longer has any right to make claims upon us, but we have the full right to reject sin and its power. By rejecting sin and taking sides with the resurrected Christ, we present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness that the divine life may work within us to sanctify us, not only positionally but also dispositionally, with the holy nature of God. ",
  "3833":"This does not make us lawless, as some were during the time of the church's degradation (Jude 4). The law referred to in this verse is the law given by Moses, which has been replaced by the inward laws in the new covenant (Heb. 10:16). Just as chs. 5 and 6 explain that we are now under grace, chs. 7 and 8 explain how it can be that we are not under the law. ",
  "3834":"Unto may be interpreted resulting in, and so in the succeeding verses. ",
  "3835":"This occurred as a result of the crucifixion of the old man (v. 6). ",
  "3836":"Righteousness ushers us into sanctification. If we present ourselves as slaves to righteousness and our members as weapons of righteousness, Christ as the eternal life within us will have the ground to work in us and saturate our inward parts with Himself. Thus we will be sanctified spontaneously; we will be made holy spontaneously in our inward parts by Christ's saturating. ",
  "3837":"Sanctification (see note 2 in ch. 1) involves not only a change in position, that is, a separation from a common, worldly position to a position for God, as illustrated in Matt. 23:17, 19 and in 1 Tim. 4:3-5; it involves also a transformation in disposition, that is, a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's nature of holiness, as mentioned in 12:2 and 2 Cor. 3:18. ",
  "3838":"See note 19. ",
  "3839":"The dispositional sanctification spoken of in this chapter not only comes out of life (vv. 4, 23) but also results in life and brings more life to us that we may enjoy the riches of the divine life. ",
  "3840":"Wages are a payment according to righteousness, based on the work that a person performs. In the eyes of God, all man's behavior apart from God is sin and is man's work, and the wages it earns is death. ",
  "3841":"Death comes from sin and is its result. The death mentioned here, however, is not only physical death and eternal death, but the death in which man is entangled daily. See note 12 in ch. 5. ",
  "3842":"Eternal life is the very life of the Triune God Himself. This life has been imparted into us on the basis of our having been justified by God, and it is now spreading throughout our being through sanctification and transformation. This will result in our being conformed to the Lord's image and our being brought into the Lord's glory, that we may be made suitable to have a part in the manifestation of His glory (Col. 3:4). ",
  "3843":"Verses 1-6 continue 6:14 to explain how it is that we are not under the law. On one hand, the law continues to exist, for God has not recalled, annulled, or abolished it. On the other hand, because of the crucifixion of our old man (6:6), who is the first husband mentioned in these verses, we are no longer under the law and no longer have anything to do with it. Instead, we have become the wife of Christ; that is, we have become those who depend on Christ. ",
  "3844":"Because fallen man left his proper position as God's wife and desired to be the husband (see note 4) God gave him the law, which he cannot possibly keep. The law is intended not for the wife but for the husband, and the law was given not that it might be kept but that the old man might be exposed (v. 5; 3:20; 5:20). Accordingly, this verse refers to the law as \"the law regarding the husband.\" ",
  "3845":"The husband here (the first husband) is not the flesh or the law but the old man mentioned in 6:6, who has been crucified with Christ. Thus, vv. 1-6 correspond with 6:6. ",
  "3846":"Referring to the second husband mentioned in these verses, who is Christ. ",
  "3847":"Since our old man, who was the old husband, has been crucified with Christ (6:6), we are freed from his law and are joined to the new Husband, Christ, the ever-living One. As believers, we have two statuses. The first you in this verse refers to us in our old status as the fallen old man, who left the original position of a wife dependent on God and took the self-assuming position of husband and head, independent of God. The second you in this verse refers to us in our new status as the regenerated new man, restored to our original and proper position as the genuine wife to God (Isa. 54:5; 1 Cor. 11:3), dependent on Him and taking Him as our Head. We no longer have the old status of the husband, for we have been crucified. We now have only the new status of the proper wife, in which we take Christ as our Husband, and should no longer live according to the old man, i.e., no longer take the old man as our husband. ",
  "3848":"This joining indicates that in our new status as a wife, we have an organic union in person, name, life, and existence with Christ in His resurrection. ",
  "3849":"As the regenerated new man and the wife to Christ, everything we are and do is now related to God, and God is brought forth by us as the fruit, the overflow, of our life. This is in contrast to the fruit born to death (v. 5), which was previously brought forth by us as the old man, the old husband. ",
  "3850":"Since the old man has been crucified, the regenerated new man is now free from the law of the old man (vv. 2-3; Gal. 2:19). Since the law was given to the old husband, the old man, not to the wife, and since the old husband, the old man, died on the cross, the new man, the wife, has been discharged from his law. ",
  "3851":"Lit., serve as slaves. ",
  "3852":"In 6:4, newness of life issues from our being identified with Christ's resurrection and is for our walk in our daily life. Here, newness of spirit issues from our being discharged from the law and being joined to the resurrected Christ, and is for our service to God. Thus, both newness of spirit and newness of life are results of the crucifixion of the old man. ",
  "3853":"Referring to our regenerated human spirit, in which the Lord as the Spirit dwells (2 Tim. 4:22). Everything that is related to our regenerated spirit is new, and everything that comes out of our spirit is new. Our regenerated spirit is a source of newness because the Lord, the life of God, and the Holy Spirit are there (see note 9 in ch. 1). ",
  "3854":"In vv. 7-25 Paul used his own experience, which he had before he believed in the Lord, to illustrate the wretchedness of trying to do good under the law in order to please God. Neither the human spirit nor the Spirit of God is mentioned in this section; rather, the will and the mind of the human soul (vv. 19, 23), which attempt to please God with the good of the natural life (vv. 18-19, 21), are referred to. Although this is the situation of an unsaved person, nearly all Christians pass through this kind of experience after they are saved. ",
  "3855":"The law portrays God and defines Him (Lev. 19:2). Accordingly, it places many demands and requirements on fallen man, and in so doing it identifies sin as sin and leads man to the knowledge of sin (3:20; 4:15; 5:20). In this way man is both exposed and subdued by the law (3:19). ",
  "3856":"The tenth commandment, \"You shall not covet,\" is not related to outward conduct, but rather to the sin within man, mainly in his thoughts. This shows that man's problem is with the sin that indwells him, not just with outward sinful acts. ",
  "3857":"This chapter, especially in this verse and in vv. 11, 17, 20, indicates that sin is a person, the embodiment of Satan, and is living and acting within us. ",
  "3858":"Referring to our being put to death by the curse and condemnation brought to us, both in our conscience and before God, by sin through the law (4:15; 5:13, 20). ",
  "3859":"The law is the instrument through which sin deceives and kills men. The power of sin is the law (1 Cor. 15:56). This fact should warn us not to turn to the law to try to keep it, for in so doing we give sin the opportunity to deceive and kill us. ",
  "3860":"Lit., appear. ",
  "3861":"The inward, subjective consciousness. See note 6 in ch. 6. ",
  "3862":"I.e., the same in essence, nature, and substance as God, who is Spirit (John 4:24). ",
  "3863":"Paul saw that he was contrary to all that is portrayed by the law. It is spiritual, holy, righteous, and good; he was fleshy, common and defiled, unjust, and evil. See note 1 in 1 Cor. 3. ",
  "3864":"Lit., do not know; i.e., do not acknowledge, do not approve of. Paul did not allow, approve of, or acknowledge his wrong action, for it issued from his flesh, which served the law of sin against his mind and against his will. ",
  "3865":"Lit., houses itself. Sin does not merely abide or remain within us for a time; it makes its home in us. ",
  "3866":"The inward, subjective consciousness. See note 6 in ch. 6. ",
  "3867":"The flesh here is the fallen and corrupted human body with all its lusts. This flesh was not created by God but is a mixture of God's creature and sin, which is the life of Satan, the evil one. God created man's body a pure vessel, but this vessel was corrupted and transmuted into the flesh by Satan's injecting himself into it at the time of the fall. Now Satan as sin personified is in man's flesh, making his home there and ruling as an illegal master, overruling man and forcing him to do things that he dislikes. It is this indwelling sin, which is the unchangeable evil nature, that constitutes all men sinners (5:19). ",
  "3868":"Here Paul was careful to say that it is in the flesh, not in man's whole being, that nothing good dwells. Good does exist in other parts of man's being. The will desires to please God (vv. 18-21) according to the good law in the mind (vv. 22-23), but it is impossible to perform this good through the body, for the body has become the flesh, where sin dwells. ",
  "3869":"To will to do good is to turn to the law. The law of good in our mind (vv. 22-23) corresponds with the law of God and responds to its demands by trying to keep it. ",
  "3870":"According to the fact mentioned in v. 20, Paul discovered that the law of sin was the sin that dwelt in him and the evil that was present with him. In v. 23 he realized that this law was the law of sin in his members. ",
  "3871":"The Greek word means that which is evil in character. This must be the evil life, nature, and character of Satan himself, who is the indwelling sin in us. When sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by our willing to do the good, it becomes \"the evil.\" ",
  "3872":"Referring to the written law of God. ",
  "3873":"There are three different laws in the three different parts of the believer's being. As revealed in chs. 7 and 8, these three laws derive from the three parties in the universe. The law of sin and death in the believer's members (v. 23), that is, in his body, derives from Satan, who as sin dwells in the believer's flesh. The law of good in the believer's mind (v. 23), that is, in his soul, derives from the natural human life, that is, from man himself. The law of the Spirit of life in the believer's spirit derives from God, who as the Spirit dwells in his spirit (8:2, 16). These three parties with the three laws are now present in the believer in much the same way that they (God, man, and Satan) were present in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3). In addition to the three laws within the believer, there is the law of God outside of him (vv. 22, 25). ",
  "3874":"The warfare here is between the law of sin in the members of our body and the law of good in the mind of our soul. It is absolutely a matter of sin in our flesh fighting against good in our natural being; it is not at all related to our spirit or the Spirit of God. Hence, it is different from the warfare in Gal. 5:16-25, between our spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God, and the flesh. ",
  "3875":"A person who is independent of God cannot deal with the law of sin in the flesh, for this law is the powerful person of Satan himself. ",
  "3876":"To attempt to keep the law by the flesh results in death and wretchedness. Man has become fleshy, sold under sin (v. 14). In man's flesh nothing good dwells (v. 18), and man is unable to master sin (vv. 15-20). If man in such a condition tries to fulfill the law of God, he will surely fail. ",
  "3877":"In 6:6 our fallen body is called \"the body of sin.\" Here it is termed \"the body of this death.\" The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to please God. Sin energizes the fallen body to sin, whereas death utterly weakens and disables the corrupted body, so that it cannot keep God's commandments. ",
  "3878":"The death caused by sin through the weapon of the law, the death of being defeated, the death of trying to keep the law to please God but instead being made a captive by the law of sin in our members. This is the death that is working in our flesh this very moment. ",
  "3879":"The phrase with the mind I myself indicates that the mind, representing the self, is independently attempting to do good. Although the law of good in the mind (v. 23) gives us the inclination to do good, the mind will be defeated because the law of sin in our members is stronger than the independent mind. ",
  "3880":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "3881":"The law of sin, sin, and the evil are synonymous terms, denoting Satan, who dwells in man's fallen body. ",
  "3882":"The phrase now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus is a strong proof that the experience illustrated in ch. 7 is that of a person who is without Christ. ",
  "3883":"The condemnation implied in 1:18--3:20 and mentioned in 5:16, 18 is objective, under God's righteous law, and is the result of our outward sins. The condemnation mentioned here is subjective, in our conscience, and is the result of our being inwardly defeated by the evil law of the indwelling sin, as described in 7:17-18, 20-24. The blood of the crucified Christ is the remedy for objective condemnation (3:25). The Spirit of life, who is Christ processed to be the life-giving Spirit and who is in our spirit, is the remedy for subjective condemnation. ",
  "3884":"In this chapter the phrase in Christ refers not only to our standing, our position, in Christ, as mentioned in ch. 6, but also to the reality of our daily walk in our regenerated spirit. Thus, this chapter speaks of being in Christ as a term or a condition. This corresponds with being saved in His life in 5:10. ",
  "3885":"The law of the Spirit of life is the subject of this chapter. The Spirit and life are mentioned in this verse, but only in connection with the working of this law. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after His being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, who is life to all the believers in Christ. The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body (Rom. 7:23, 17), is of this Spirit of life. It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements (see note 4). <br><br>   Both Satan and God, after entering into our being and dwelling in us, work within us not by outward, objective activities but by an inward, subjective law. The working of the law of the Spirit of life is the working of the processed Triune God in our spirit; this is also the working of the Triune God in us in His life. ",
  "3886":"Here law, the Spirit, and life are in contrast to law, sin, and death. The two laws are in opposition to each other, the Spirit is in opposition to sin, and life is in opposition to death. In ch. 5 grace, which is God embodied in us, is in opposition to sin, which is Satan embodied in us (5:21). In ch. 8 the Spirit, who is God living in us, is in opposition to sin. Thus, the grace in ch. 5 is the Spirit in ch. 8, the very God embodied in us as grace, living and acting in us. <br><br>   In the previous chapters life is mentioned a number of times (1:17; 2:7; 5:10, 17-18, 21; 6:4, 22-23). In this chapter life is joined with the Spirit in the phrase the Spirit of life, showing that everything regarding life in the preceding chapters is included in the Spirit in this chapter. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one (John 6:63). The way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is by the Spirit of life. ",
  "3887":"The spiritual life revealed in this chapter is fourfold. First, it was the divine life in the Spirit (v. 2). Second, it became life in our spirit through regeneration (v. 10). Then from our spirit it saturates our mind for the transformation of our soul, to which our mind belongs, and becomes the life in our soul (v. 6). Eventually, it will permeate our body and become the life in our body (v. 11), ultimately issuing in the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21), that is, the redemption of our body (v. 23). ",
  "3888":"The major function of the processed Triune God in indwelling our spirit as the law of the Spirit of life is to free us completely from Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature as the law of sin and of death (7:23-25). This freeing is not only for our subjective justification but even more for our dispositional sanctification. ",
  "3889":"Some ancient MSS read, you. ",
  "3890":"The law of sin, the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man, causes man to become a slave of sin (John 8:34). Thus, man is helpless, is controlled and manipulated by sin, and does many things against his will. The law of death, the natural power that causes man to become weak, to wither up, and to age and die, dwells in man and causes every part of man to enter into decay and death. On one hand, death disables man; on the other hand, it desensitizes man. It causes man to be disabled when he attempts to do good, and to be insensitive when he commits sins. ",
  "3891":"In the flesh nothing good dwells (7:18); only sin dwells in the flesh (7:17). Furthermore, the flesh is of death (7:24). Hence, no man can be justified before God out of the works of the law through the flesh (3:20). Because of such a weak and impotent flesh, there is something that the law could not do. ",
  "3892":"On one hand, the law of God outside man is a law in letters, is dead, and lacks the power of life to supply man to meet its demands. On the other hand, man's body has been corrupted by Satan to become the flesh of death, and as such is incapable of keeping the law. It is because of these two factors that there is \"that which the law could not do\"; that is, the law is incapable of pleasing God through man's keeping of it. ",
  "3893":"The flesh is of sin, yet the Son of God became flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14; 1 Tim. 3:16). However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and did not have the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). This was typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites (Num. 21:9; John 3:14). The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of the actual serpent but did not have its poison. It was such a bronze serpent that bore God's judgment for the poisoned Israelites and dealt with the serpents that poisoned them. <br><br>   Although Christ did not have the sin of the flesh, He was crucified in the flesh (Col. 1:22; 1 Pet. 3:18). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him (John 12:31; 16:11), thereby destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14). At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh. As a result, it is possible for us to walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us (v. 4). ",
  "3894":"Not consciously kept by us through our outward endeavoring but spontaneously and unconsciously fulfilled in us by the inward working of the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the Spirit of Christ, and Christ corresponds with the law of God. This Spirit within us spontaneously fulfills all the righteous requirements of the law through us when we walk according to Him. ",
  "3895":"The Greek word denotes the general walk in our living. See note 16 in Gal. 5. The requirements that we must fulfill in order that the law of the Spirit of life (which has already been installed in us) may work are: (1) to walk according to the spirit (v. 4); (2) to mind the things of the Spirit &#151; to set the mind on the spirit (vv. 5-6); (3) to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body (v. 13); (4) to be led by the Spirit as sons of God (v. 14); (5) to cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship (v. 15); (6) to witness that we are the children of God (v. 16); and (7) to groan for the full sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23). ",
  "3896":"It is difficult to discern the word spirit used in this chapter, in Gal. 5, and in other places in the New Testament, unless it is clearly designated to denote God's Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit, as in v. 9 and v. 16 of this chapter. According to the usage in the New Testament, the word spirit, as used in this verse, denotes our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God (v. 9). This corresponds with 1 Cor. 6:17, \"He who is joined to the Lord [who is the Spirit &#151; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45] is one spirit\" &#151; one mingled spirit. ",
  "3897":"The things of the flesh include anything that is in the realm of the flesh, whether evil or good. ",
  "3898":"Not only to walk and have our activities according to the spirit, but to have our entire being according to the spirit. When we are according to the spirit, our walk also is according to the spirit. In this spirit the indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the processed Triune God Himself, works within us spontaneously and frees us from the law of sin and of death. ",
  "3899":"The things of the Spirit are the things concerning Christ, which the Spirit receives and declares to us (John 16:14-15). As we exercise ourselves to mind these things, eventually our whole being will be according to the spirit. ",
  "3900":"Lit., the mind of the flesh. In vv. 6-8 the crucial item is the mind. The mind is the leading part of the soul, which is man's personality, his person. The mind thus represents the soul, that is, the person himself. In this chapter the mind is neutral, being between the regenerated mingled spirit and the fallen body, the flesh. Chapters 7 and 8 show that the mind may have two different actions, by which it can cause us to be either in the spirit or in the flesh. If it relies on and attaches itself to the regenerated spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God, the mind will bring us into the spirit and into the enjoyment of the divine Spirit as the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2). If the mind attaches itself to the flesh and acts independently, it will bring us into the flesh, causing us to be at enmity with God and to be unable to please Him (vv. 7-8). ",
  "3901":"Life and peace result from setting our mind on the spirit. When our mind is set on the spirit, our outward actions are in agreement with our inner man and there is no discrepancy between us and God. He and we are at peace, not at enmity (v. 7). The result is that we feel peaceful within. <br><br>   When our mind is set on the flesh and the things of the flesh, the result is death, which causes us to feel separated from the enjoyment of God. We feel uneasy and deadened instead of peaceful and living. When we are minding the flesh and setting our mind on the things of the flesh, the sense of death should serve as a warning to us, urging us to be delivered from the flesh and to live in the spirit. ",
  "3902":"Lit., the mind of the spirit. Setting the mind on the spirit is the same as minding the things of the Spirit in v. 5. Verse 6 and vv. 7-13 show that Christ today is the life of God in the divine Spirit (v. 2) and also the indwelling life of God in God's people, because God's Spirit of life has become the indwelling Spirit in us, the Spirit in both aspects being Christ. ",
  "3903":"If we mind the flesh, or set our mind on the flesh, we become those who are in the flesh. ",
  "3904":"Verses 8 and 9 emphasize the word in, showing that the stress here is on the condition and experience more than on the source and position. ",
  "3905":"This chapter unveils to us how the Triune God &#151; the Father (v. 15), the Son (vv. 3, 29, 32), and the Spirit (vv. 9, 11, 13-14, 16, 23, 26) &#151; dispenses Himself as life (vv. 2, 6, 10, 11) into us, the tripartite men &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; to make us His sons (vv. 14-15, 19, 23, 29, 17) for the constituting of the Body of Christ (12:4-5). ",
  "3906":"I.e., makes home, resides (cf. Eph. 3:17). If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to make His home in us, that is, to settle Himself in us with adequate room, then in our experience we are in the spirit and are no longer in the flesh. If we are so, the Triune God as the Spirit will be able to spread from our spirit (v. 10) into our soul, represented by our mind (v. 6), and eventually He will even give life to our mortal body (v. 11). ",
  "3907":"This shows that our being of Christ depends on His Spirit. If there were no Spirit of Christ, or if Christ were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be joined to Him and to belong to Him. However, Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and is one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). ",
  "3908":"The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one. Paul used these titles interchangeably, indicating that the indwelling Spirit of life in v. 2 is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the entire Triune God. God, the Spirit, and Christ &#151; the three of the Godhead &#151; are all mentioned in this verse. However, there are not three in us; there is only one, the triune Spirit of the Triune God (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:11). The Spirit of God implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past, who created the universe and is the origin of all things. The Spirit of Christ implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ, the incarnated One. This Christ accomplished everything necessary to fulfill God's plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. He also includes human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit (v. 10) to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature (v. 2). Thus, we may live today in Christ's resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit. ",
  "3909":"Referring to the unchangeable source and position rather than to the changeable condition and experience. We have the Spirit of Christ according to the source, the new birth; hence, we are of Christ and belong to Him. In our present experience and spiritual condition, however, we need to be not only of Him but also in Him. ",
  "3910":"In this verse the Spirit is not mentioned, for here the emphasis is that Christ today is the Spirit and that the Spirit of Christ is the very Christ in us. According to the fact, it is Christ; according to experience, it is the Spirit. In our experience of Him, He is the Spirit; in our worshipping Him, calling on Him, and speaking of Him, He is Christ. We receive Him as our Savior and Redeemer, but He enters into us as the Spirit. As the Redeemer, He has the title Christ; as the Indweller, He has the title the Spirit. These are not two who dwell in us but one Dweller in two aspects. ",
  "3911":"\"Christ ... in you\" is the crucial point of the book of Romans. In ch. 3 Christ is on the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption; in ch. 4 He is in resurrection; in ch. 6 we are in Him; now, in ch. 8 He is the Spirit in us. ",
  "3912":"Before we believed in the Lord, our spirit within was dead and our body without was alive. Now that we have Christ in us, though our body without is dead because of sin, our spirit within is life because of righteousness. Christ's coming into us as life exposes the death situation of our body. In our spirit is Christ the Spirit as righteousness, resulting in life; but in our flesh is Satan as sin, resulting in death. ",
  "3913":"Through the fall of man, sin, bringing death with it, entered the human body, causing it to become dead and impotent in the things of God. Although God condemned sin in the flesh (v. 3), this sin has not been uprooted or eradicated from man's fallen body. Hence, our body is still dead. ",
  "3914":"The regenerated human spirit, in contrast to the fallen human body. This spirit is not the Spirit of God, for the spirit mentioned here is life only under the condition that Christ is in us. For the Spirit of God to be life, no particular condition is required. Hence, the spirit's being life because of righteousness can refer only to our human spirit, not to the Spirit of God. ",
  "3915":"Our spirit has not only been regenerated and made living; it has become life. When we believed in Christ, He as the divine Spirit of life came into our spirit and mingled Himself with it; the two spirits thereby have become one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Now our spirit is not merely living but is life. ",
  "3916":"In God's justification we have received righteousness, which is the Triune God Himself entering into our being, into our spirit. This righteousness results in life (5:18, 21); hence, our spirit has now become life. ",
  "3917":"The objective facts revealed in ch. 6 concerning our death and resurrection in Christ become our subjective experience only when we are in the indwelling Spirit, who is revealed in ch. 8. ",
  "3918":"In this verse we have (1) the entire Triune God &#151; \"the One who raised Jesus from the dead,\" \"Christ Jesus,\" and \"His Spirit who indwells you\"; (2) the process required for His dispensing, as implied in the words Jesus (emphasizing incarnation), Christ (emphasizing crucifixion and resurrection), and raised (emphasizing resurrection); and (3) His dispensing of Himself into the believers, as shown by the words give life to your mortal bodies, which indicate that the dispensing not only occurs at the center of our being but also reaches to the circumference, to our whole being. ",
  "3919":"See note 9. ",
  "3920":"This does not refer to divine healing but to the result of our allowing the Spirit of God to make His home in us and saturate our entire being with the divine life. In this way He gives His life to our mortal, dying body, not merely to heal it but also that it may be enlivened to carry out His will. ",
  "3921":"After we are saved, it is still possible for us to live according to the flesh by setting the mind on the flesh. But when we are in spirit and walk according to the spirit, we are freed from the flesh and are no longer obligated to it as debtors. ",
  "3922":"In this verse, to die, to put to death, and to live are spiritual matters, not physical. ",
  "3923":"We must put to death the practices of the body, but we must do it by the Spirit. On one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us. On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>   The putting to death here is actually our coordinating with the Spirit who indwells us. Inwardly, we must allow Him to make His home in us that He may give life to our mortal body (v. 11). Outwardly, we must put to death the practices of our body that we may live. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply the effectiveness of Christ's death to those practices, thus killing them. ",
  "3924":"It is not the body itself but its practices that we must put to death. The body needs to be redeemed (v. 23), but its practices need to be put to death. These practices include not only sinful things but also all things practiced by our body apart from the Spirit. ",
  "3925":"The leading by the Spirit is not outward but inward, and is composed of the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2), the Spirit (vv. 9-13), and life (vv. 6-11). This verse speaks of our being led by the Spirit rather than of the Spirit's leading us, indicating that although the Spirit is ready to lead us, we must take the initiative to be led by Him. This means that we must take Him as our life and everything and that we must put to death everything of the old creation in us. We do not need to seek after the Spirit's leading, since it is already present within us, dwelling in our regenerated spirit. If we live under this leading, we will walk and behave in a way that proves that we are God's sons. ",
  "3926":"The leading here is not merely an action of the Spirit. It is the Triune God Himself becoming the leading in our spirit. If we would care for Him as a person who indwells us, we will spontaneously be led by Him. ",
  "3927":"The central thought of the book of Romans is that God's salvation makes sinners His sons, who have His life and nature so that they can express Him, that they may become members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ for His expression. Hence, sonship is stressed in this chapter (vv. 15, 23). Sons here indicates a more advanced stage of growth in the divine life than does children in v. 16, yet not as advanced as heirs in v. 17. Children refers to the initial stage of sonship, the stage of regeneration in the human spirit. Sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls. They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit. Heirs are the sons of God who, through the transfiguration of their body in the stage of glorification, will be fully matured in every part of their being. Hence, they will be qualified as the legal heirs to claim the divine inheritance (vv. 17, 23). ",
  "3928":"Our regenerated human spirit, mingled with the Spirit of the Son of God (see note 6 in Gal. 4). Sonship in this spirit includes the life, the position, the living, the enjoyment, the birthright, the inheritance, and the manifestation of a son. Such an all-inclusive sonship is now in our spirit. ",
  "3929":"An Aramaic word that means father. After being regenerated, we are no longer merely God's creatures; we are His children. Because we have now been born of God and are related to Him in life, it is very normal and sweet for us to call Him \"Father\" (see note 6 in Gal. 4). ",
  "3930":"It is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also. Rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. ",
  "3931":"This reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). See John 3:6; 4:24; and notes there. ",
  "3932":"This is the witnessing of the Spirit when we cry \"Abba, Father\" (v. 15). Such a witnessing testifies to us and assures us that we are the children of God, who possess His life; it also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God. The Spirit witnesses to our most basic and elementary relationship with God, namely, that we are His children; it does not witness that we are His sons or His heirs. Therefore, this witnessing of the Spirit begins from the time of our spiritual birth, our regeneration. ",
  "3933":"This shows that there is a condition for us to be heirs. It is not that we are heirs simply because we are children of God. Rather, after being born as children, we must grow in life to become sons, and then we must pass through suffering that we may be glorified to become legal heirs. ",
  "3934":"I.e., consider after calculating. ",
  "3935":"Lit., into, to. ",
  "3936":"Lit., watching with head outstretched, with full concentration. ",
  "3937":"An unveiling or appearing of something previously covered or hidden. Although we are the sons of God, we are veiled, not yet revealed. At the Lord's second coming, when we will be glorified and our bodies will be fully redeemed, the veil will be lifted. The creation is eagerly awaiting this. This revelation will be the consummation of the process of designation that we are now passing through (see note 4 in ch. 1). ",
  "3938":"At present the creation is enslaved under the law of decay and corruption. Its only hope is to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God when the sons of God are revealed. ",
  "3939":"The firstfruits of the Spirit are simply the Spirit Himself as the firstfruits. The Triune God is our enjoyment; He is everything to us. There will be a harvest of this blessing at the redemption of our body; that will be the full enjoyment. Today the Spirit is the firstfruits of the coming harvest, the foretaste of our full enjoyment of God. ",
  "3940":"Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life. Our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God. Hence, we groan together with the creation (vv. 19, 22) and eagerly await the glorious day when we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body, and will be freed from the slavery of corruption. ",
  "3941":"This sonship began with the regeneration of our spirit, is continuing with the transformation of our soul, and will be consummated with the redemption of our body. ",
  "3942":"In like manner indicates that prior to the help of the Spirit mentioned in this verse, there was already another help of the Spirit, which must be the help rendered to us by the Spirit as the firstfruits mentioned in v. 23. This is confirmed by the fact that both v. 23 and this verse speak of our groaning. ",
  "3943":"The weakness here is our ignorance of how we should pray. We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray, according to the burden we feel, for our being conformed to the image of God's Son; hence, we groan (v. 23). In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. His interceding is mainly that we may experience the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship that we may be fully conformed to the image of God's Son. ",
  "3944":"This is not the mind of the Spirit that is independent of us. It is the mind of the Spirit that has been mingled with our mind (v. 6) and has become a part of our heart. The Spirit not only has mingled Himself with our spirit; He has also mingled His mind with our mind. ",
  "3945":"The interceding Spirit prays for us not according to something of God but according to God Himself, that we may be conformed to the image of God's Son. ",
  "3946":"Including all persons, all matters, and all things. ",
  "3947":"God the Father answers when the Spirit intercedes for us, and He arranges our circumstances, causing all things to work together for good to us. ",
  "3948":"According to the context, the good here is not related to physical persons, matters, or things. It refers to our gaining more of Christ, to our having Him wrought into our being, that we may be transformed metabolically and may eventually be conformed to His image, the image of the Son of God (v. 29), that is, that we may be brought into the full sonship. ",
  "3949":"Loving God causes us to care for His desire and to be willing to coordinate with Him. God's working needs our coordination, and our coordinating with God confirms that we are called by God according to His purpose. ",
  "3950":"Referring to the purposeful determination in God's plan. This is God's purpose to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son. ",
  "3951":"In vv. 29-30 all the steps of God's work are described using the past tense, indicating that in His eyes all the work has been completed. Because God is the God of eternity, there is no element of time with Him. ",
  "3952":"God has predestinated us not simply that we may be sanctified, spiritual, and victorious but that we may be fully conformed to the image of His Son. This is our destiny, determined by God in eternity past. ",
  "3953":"Conformation is the end result of transformation. It includes the changing of our inward essence and nature, and it also includes the changing of our outward form, that we may match the glorified image of Christ, the God-man. He is the prototype and we are the mass production. Both the inward and the outward changes in us, the product, are the result of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2) in our being. ",
  "3954":"Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18). When He was sent by God into the world, He was still the only begotten Son of God (1 John 4:9; John 1:14; 3:16). By His passing through death and entering into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity. Thus, in His divinity with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God's firstborn Son (Acts 13:33). At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3) and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God. Thus they became His many brothers to constitute His Body and be God's corporate expression in Him. <br><br>   As the only begotten Son of God, Christ had divinity but not humanity; He was self-existing and ever-existing, as God is. His being the firstborn Son of God, having both divinity and humanity, began with His resurrection. With His firstborn Son as the base, pattern, element, and means, God is producing many sons, and the many sons who are produced are the many believers who believe into God's firstborn Son and are joined to Him as one. They are exactly like Him in life and nature, and, like Him, they have both humanity and divinity. They are His increase and expression in order that they may express the eternal Triune God for eternity. The church today is a miniature of this expression (Eph. 1:23), and the New Jerusalem in eternity will be the ultimate manifestation of this expression (Rev. 21:11). This book reveals that God's making sinners His sons is for this expression (12:5) and points to the ultimate manifestation of this expression (Eph. 3:19). ",
  "3955":"The purpose of God's foreknowledge, predestination, and calling is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son (see note 17 in John 20) that, on the one hand, they, together with God's firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God, and that, on the other hand, they may be the many members who constitute the Body of God's firstborn Son as the corporate expression of God in His firstborn Son, which is the fullness of God's firstborn Son, that is, the fullness of God in His firstborn Son (Eph. 1:23; 3:19). ",
  "3956":"Justification is a bridge that brings sinners, who are redeemed by Christ, from the law's condemnation (3:19) into God's acceptance (5:1-2). In this acceptance God works to conform them to the image of His Son until He brings them into His glory (Heb. 2:10). ",
  "3957":"Glorification is the step in God's complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal (7:24; 8:11; 6:6), with the glory of His life and nature according to the principle of His regenerating our spirit through the Spirit. In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son (Phil. 3:21). This is the ultimate step in God's complete salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem in the coming age. ",
  "3958":"Or, Shall God, who justifies? ",
  "3959":"Or, Shall Christ Jesus, who died ... for us? ",
  "3960":"This verse states that Christ today is at the right hand of God, in the heavens; v. 10, however, states that He is now in us, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He is omnipresent, being both at the right hand of God and in our spirit, both in heaven and on earth. ",
  "3961":"In this verse it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in v. 26 it is the Spirit who intercedes for us. These are not two Intercessors but one, the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). He is interceding for us at two ends. At one end it is the Spirit in us, probably initiating the intercession for us; at the other end it is the Lord Christ at the right hand of God, probably completing the intercession for us, which must be mainly that we will be conformed to His image and brought into His glory. ",
  "3962":"Because of God's unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished everything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than overcome and conquer through Him who loved us. ",
  "3963":"The love of God is the source of His eternal salvation. This love is in Christ and has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (5:5). Nothing can separate us from this love of God (vv. 38-39). In God's salvation this love to us has become the love of Christ (v. 35), which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God's complete salvation is accomplished in us. These marvelous things provoke God's enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities (vv. 35-36). However, because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have become benefits to us (v. 28). Hence, we more than conquer in all our afflictions and calamities (v. 37). <br><br>   By the end of ch. 8 this book has covered the first half of God's salvation in Christ. This salvation has saved us to the extent that, on the one hand, we are in God's acceptance enjoying the source of this salvation, which is God's love in Christ, from which we cannot be separated by any person, matter, or thing; and, on the other hand, we are in God's life being conformed by the Lord Spirit to reach the ultimate goal of this salvation, that is, to enter into the incomparable divine glory and be glorified together with God (vv. 18, 30). ",
  "3964":"After covering the first half of God's salvation in Christ, and before going on to the second half, the section from chs. 9--11 is inserted to explain in detail the selection of God's chosen people, which was of God Himself. ",
  "3965":"In 8:16 the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit, whereas in this verse our conscience bears witness with us in the Holy Spirit. This proves that our conscience is in our human spirit. ",
  "3966":"For Paul to wish that Israel would be saved was necessary, but to wish that he himself would be a curse and would be separated from Christ would have been extreme. Paul could wish in this way out of a desperation produced by his intense desire for Israel's salvation. ",
  "3967":"Sonship here is the right of inheritance. ",
  "3968":"The service in the tabernacle or in the temple, instituted according to the law of Moses. ",
  "3969":"It is clearly stated here that Christ is God, proving that although Christ was a man (5:15) with flesh who came out of the tribe of Judah, a tribe of Israel, He is also God, who is over all and blessed forever. He is both man and God. He is God the Son, and He is the Triune God. ",
  "3970":"This shows God's economy in His selection. All Jews are born of Israel, but not all of them have been selected by God. Only Isaac and a part of his descendants have been selected by God and reckoned as the children of God (vv. 7-8). This selection is not of man's works but of the Lord who calls and of His mercy (vv. 11, 16). ",
  "3971":"See note 28 in ch. 8. ",
  "3972":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "3973":"This is God's sovereign authority, which allows Him to have mercy on man according to His desire. ",
  "3974":"Mercy refers mainly to an action taken in response to man's wretched condition; hence, God's showing mercy to man is outward. Compassion, however, refers mainly to an inward feeling that is expressed by groanings and tears; hence, God's having compassion on man is inward. Therefore, compassion is deeper than mercy. ",
  "3975":"This indicates that God chose us that we might be vessels of honor to contain Him. God created man as a vessel to contain Him, and out of the many vessels He chose us to contain Him, the God of honor, that we might be vessels of honor. Finally, He makes known His glory upon us, the vessels, that we might become vessels of His glory (v. 23). All this is out of His mercy and according to His mercy; it cannot be obtained by our efforts. For this reason we must worship Him, and we must worship Him for His mercy! ",
  "3976":"This is the glory in the manifestation of the coming kingdom, in which we, the revealed sons of God, will participate (8:17-23). ",
  "3977":"The Israelites seek to establish their own righteousness by trying to keep the law, and have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself. This is an insult to God, and it causes them to miss the way of God's salvation. ",
  "3978":"Christ came to fulfill the law (Matt. 5:17) that He might terminate the law and replace it (8:3-4). Thus, everyone who believes in Him receives God's righteousness, which is Christ Himself. ",
  "3979":"This refers to Christ's incarnation. ",
  "3980":"The Greek word is used in Luke 8:31 in reference to the dwelling place of the demons; in Rev. 9:1, 2, 11 to denote the place out of which the locusts, whose king is Apollyon (Antichrist), will come; in Rev. 11:7 and 17:8 to signify the place out of which the beast, the Antichrist, will ascend; and in Rev. 20:1, 3 to specify the place into which Satan will be cast and imprisoned during the millennium. The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses this word for deep in Gen. 1:2. Here, in this verse, it points to the place Christ visited after His death and before His resurrection, which place, according to Acts 2:24, 27, is Hades; for Acts 2:24, 27 reveals that Christ went into Hades after He died, and rose from that place in His resurrection. Hence, according to biblical usage, the word abyss always refers to the region of death and of Satan's power of darkness, which is the lower parts of the earth (Eph. 4:9), into which Christ descended after His death, which He conquered, and from which He ascended in His resurrection. ",
  "3981":"This refers to Christ's resurrection. ",
  "3982":"Here the word is used interchangeably with Christ (vv. 6-7), indicating that this word is Christ. Christ was incarnated by coming down from heaven and was resurrected by coming up from Hades. Thus, He has become the living Word, the Spirit (Eph. 6:17), to be in our mouth and in our heart, just like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being. He is near and He is available. ",
  "3983":"Christ needs our participation in Him. Since we have been made vessels to contain Him, we need to believe with our heart to receive Him, and to call on Him continually with our mouth to take Him in, thus allowing His riches to fill our empty vessel (9:21-23). ",
  "3984":"Christ's being raised from the dead was invisible; hence, it requires our believing. Moreover, although Christ's death has redeemed us, it is His life in resurrection alone that can save us. Therefore, only when we believe in the great miracle that God performed in Him in raising Him from the dead can we be both redeemed and saved. ",
  "3985":"To believe with the heart is toward God; to confess with the mouth is toward man. To believe with the heart is to believe in Christ, who was glorified and raised by God from the dead; to confess with the mouth is to confess that Jesus, who was despised and rejected by man, is Lord. Both are conditions for our being justified and saved. ",
  "3986":"I.e., resulting in. ",
  "3987":"This shows that God selects us, redeems us, justifies us, sanctifies us, conforms us, and glorifies us in Christ in order that we may enjoy His unsearchable riches in Christ (Eph. 3:8). The secret to this enjoyment is to call on His name. ",
  "3988":"Calling on the name of the Lord is the secret not only to our salvation but also to our enjoyment of the Lord's riches. Beginning with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, and continuing all the way down to the New Testament believers, God's chosen and redeemed ones enjoyed Christ's redemption and salvation and all His riches by means of this secret (see note 21 in Acts 2). ",
  "3989":"To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord. The Lord is rich to both Jews and Greeks. All who call on the Lord's name enjoy this rich Lord; as a result, they are filled with Him and express Him. ",
  "3990":"One who believes into the Lord will surely call on the Lord's name. Calling on the Lord results in immediate salvation (vv. 10, 13). ",
  "3991":"This implies that believing is through the word and is due to the word (v. 17). ",
  "3992":"To our human feeling, obeying the gospel is deeper than believing the gospel. Before we believe the gospel, we are first subdued by the Holy Spirit so that we will obey the gospel. Those who do not obey the gospel may become enemies of God's gospel (11:28), enemies of God Himself. ",
  "3993":"Chapters 9 and 10 may seem to indicate that God, having originally chosen Israel, has now given them up. Here, however, the apostle, using himself and Elijah as examples, proves that this is not the case. ",
  "3994":"Lit., soul. ",
  "3995":"Baal, which in Hebrew means master, possessor, was the name of a chief idol of the Phoenicians and Canaanites. ",
  "3996":"Israel stumbled on the stone of stumbling, Christ (9:32), but did not fall. Rather, they only misstepped in order that God's salvation might come to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46). This is God's economy in His selection. ",
  "3997":"The three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, referred to in v. 28 as \"the fathers,\" are the firstfruits of the dough, which were offered to God for His satisfaction. They are also the root that supports the branches of God's cultivated olive tree, Israel. ",
  "3998":"Grafting produces an organic union (see note 5 in ch. 6). It is not the exchanging of a poor life for a better life. Rather, it is the uniting of two lives as one so that they may share one mingled life and one living. Such a mingling of life takes place when two similar yet different lives pass through death (cutting) and resurrection (growth). This depicts our union with Christ. ",
  "3999":"According to the word in Matt. 2:15, \"Out of Egypt I called My Son,\" a quotation from Hosea 11:1, Christ and the real Israel are one entity. When the Gentile believers are grafted into Christ, they are grafted into Israel, the cultivated olive tree, to become fellow partakers of the fatness (Christ) of the root (the patriarchs &#151; v. 16), the unsearchable riches of God in Christ (Eph. 3:8). They and Israel have become the branches of Christ, the true vine (John 15:1, 5), and with Him the two have become the organism that expresses the Triune God. ",
  "4000":"This will occur at the Lord's second coming, when all the remnant of the nation of Israel will repent and turn to believe in Him as their Messiah and be saved (Zech. 12:10; Rom. 11:26). ",
  "4001":"Referring to the repentant and believing Gentiles. The completion of the fullness of the believing Gentiles is different from the fulfillment of the times of the Gentiles (Luke 21:24). The latter denotes the termination of the time of Gentile power. ",
  "4002":"This shows clearly God's economy in His selection. Israel's unbelief affects their relationship with God. Nevertheless, since the calling that issues out of God's selection is irrevocable (v. 29), they are still the beloved people of God positionally. ",
  "4003":"Man's disobedience even fulfills God's mercy. ",
  "4004":"This is a praise to God for His riches, wisdom, and knowledge, which are beyond what man can search and trace, and which God exercised in creating all things and in arranging all things for the fulfillment of the selection of His chosen people. This praise and that in 16:25-27, at the end of this book, are of different sources and have different goals. The former comes out of God's selection and has the accomplishing of God's selection as the goal; the latter comes out of God's mystery in the times of the ages and has the fulfillment of that mystery as the goal. Both result in the giving of glory to God. ",
  "4005":"Wisdom is deeper and higher than knowledge. Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, whereas knowledge is seen in the practical application of the thing that was initiated by wisdom. God is the unique Initiator, as seen especially here in the matter of His selection. His wisdom in initiating His selection and His knowledge in carrying it out, as described in these chapters, deserve our highest praise! ",
  "4006":"After the parenthetical word that explains in detail God's selection, this book, continuing ch. 8, speaks concerning the latter half of God's complete salvation in Christ. In this latter half, those who enjoy the first half of God's complete salvation are members one of another as the Body of Christ (v. 5). Furthermore, they have the living of the Body of Christ on the earth to express Christ in different localities (such as those enumerated in ch. 16) that the Triune God may be expressed in such a living, as taught in the five chapters of the holy Word in this section, which concern the various aspects of this living. The first half of God's complete salvation, revealed in chs. 1--8, is the procedure by which God achieves His purpose; the second half of God's complete salvation, revealed in chs. 12--16, is the purpose of God's complete salvation. ",
  "4007":"Or, beg. ",
  "4008":"See note 15 in ch. 9. In Greek the compassions referred to here are plural. God has had many kinds of compassion on us, as shown in His selecting us, calling us, saving us, and bringing us into His life that we may enjoy His riches and become His expression. Through these many compassions as the means and the motivating power, the apostle exhorted us to present our bodies to God for the fulfillment of His purpose. ",
  "4009":"For the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, to be realized, our entire being is needed. Thus, this chapter speaks concerning our body (v. 1), our soul (v. 2), and our spirit (v. 11). Our body must be presented to God for the Body of Christ. ",
  "4010":"In ch. 6 the members of our body are to be presented as weapons of righteousness (6:13) for warfare and service. In this chapter, however, our bodies are to be presented as a living sacrifice for the church life. This sacrifice is living because it has life through resurrection; it is not like the sacrifices in the Old Testament, which were all slain. This sacrifice is also holy because, positionally, it has been separated unto God by the blood of Christ from the world and from all persons, matters, and things that are common; and because, dispositionally, the natural life and the old creation have been sanctified and transformed by the Holy Spirit with God's life and God's holy nature for God's satisfaction. Thus, this sacrifice is well pleasing to God. <br><br>   In Greek, bodies here is plural and sacrifice is singular. This indicates that, although many bodies are presented, they become one sacrifice, implying that, although we are many, our service in the Body of Christ should not be many individual services, separated and unrelated. All our service should constitute one whole service, and this service must be unique because it is the service of the one Body of Christ. ",
  "4011":"Or, intelligent, logical, rational, in harmony with the highest reason. ",
  "4012":"Service in worship of God. See note 9 in ch. 1. Before this chapter such a service is not mentioned with reference to believers other than the apostle. This indicates that the service of the believers is an issue of the growth in life described in the foregoing chapters. It indicates further that this service must be in the Body, the church. This corresponds with the types in Exodus and Leviticus, which show that the service of the priesthood rendered to God was not established until after the tent of meeting was built. ",
  "4013":"This means that we should not be assimilated by the world to the extent that we who have been separated from the world unto God have the same image as this age, not caring for the transformation of the Lord Spirit in us with God's essence to conform us to the Lord's glorious image (2 Cor. 3:18), which the Spirit carries out by moving and working in us through the divine life and the divine nature. ",
  "4014":"This age denotes the present, practical part of the world (see note 4 in Gal. 1), that part which we contact and in which we live; whereas the world, the evil system of Satan (see note 2 in Eph. 2), is the composition of all people, matters, and things outside of God, including religious as well as secular things, as in Gal. 6:14, where the world mentioned is the religious world of Paul's time. This satanic world is composed of many different ages, each having its own particular pattern, characteristics, fashions, styles, and trends. We cannot forsake the world without forsaking the present age that appears before us. ",
  "4015":"Transformation is the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged. As a result, we will be transformed into His image (2 Cor. 3:18), that is, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God as His many brothers (8:29). Thus we will be suitable for the building up of His Body. ",
  "4016":"After presenting our body, we need to have our mind renewed. The renewing of the mind, which results from setting the mind on the spirit (8:6), is the base for the transformation of our soul. Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion automatically follow to be renewed also. To be renewed means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward metabolic transformation, making us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the church life. All the virtues and the overcoming in chs. 12--16 also are the results of this transformation. ",
  "4017":"I.e., see and discern. Based on the presenting of our bodies and the renewing of our minds, we will see, discern, and prove by testing that the will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness and expression. ",
  "4018":"In this chapter the will of God is that we whom God has chosen, called, redeemed, justified, sanctified, and conformed unto glorification in the preceding eleven chapters may be members one of another to have the living of the Body of Christ (vv. 3-5). The Body of Christ is the peak of God's divine revelation. The living of the Body is the issue and goal of the presenting of our bodies, the renewing of our mind, and all the life practices in the foregoing chapters. ",
  "4019":"I.e., esteem himself. If we are to have the proper church life, the first thing that must be torn down is the high esteem that we have for ourselves, that we may think so as to be sober-minded. This requires that our mind be renewed by having all the negative elements within it swallowed up by the life of Christ. Then we will esteem ourselves according to the faith that God has apportioned to us, that is, according to the measure of God's element that has been transfused into us. ",
  "4020":"Function is for service in the Body of Christ (v. 1). In order to function, we must have life, the divine life for the divine expression. ",
  "4021":"We are one Body in Christ, having an organic union with Him. This union makes us one in life with Him and with all the other members of His Body. The Body is not an organization or a society but is altogether an organism produced by the union in life that we have with Christ. ",
  "4022":"The purpose of God's salvation is to have Christ reproduced in millions of saints that they may become the members of His Body, not separate and complete individual units but parts of a living, functioning, coordinated, corporate whole. Although these parts have different functions, they are not detached from one another. Rather, they are \"individually members one of another.\" Each member is organically joined to all the others, and each needs the function of all the others. All the members must be coordinated together to practice the Body life that is revealed in this chapter. ",
  "4023":"The gifts are received according to the grace given to us and are a result of our experience of the grace of Christ. This grace is God in Christ as the divine element coming into our being to be our life for our enjoyment. When this grace comes into us, it brings with it the element of certain spiritual skills and abilities, which, accompanying our growth in life, develop into the gifts in life that we may function in the Body of Christ to serve God. The gifts in life here are different from the gifts mentioned in Eph. 4:8, which refer to the gifted persons given by Christ in His ascension to His Body for its building up. The gifts in life here are also different from the miraculous gifts mentioned in 1 Cor. 12 and 14. The gifts in life are developed by the growth in life and by the transformation in life mentioned in v. 2, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1 Cor. 1:7. ",
  "4024":"To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God under His direct revelation. Prediction may be included in prophecy, but it is not the main aspect of the prophecy mentioned here. Prophesying brings in God's revelation for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:4b). These three &#151; prophecy, teaching (v. 7), and exhortation (v. 8) &#151; are related and coordinate with one another. The one who prophesies speaks what he has received as a direct revelation from God. The one who teaches instructs others, not based on direct revelation but based on what the prophets have spoken. He who exhorts does so according to both the direct speaking under God's revelation and the teaching that is according to this revelation. These three kinds of speaking are for the building up of the Body. They minister the life supply to the saints that they may grow together by God's word. ",
  "4025":"The service of the deacons and deaconesses in the local churches. See 16:1, 1 Tim. 3:8-13, and Phil. 1:1. ",
  "4026":"Denoting those who give to supply the needy ones in the church and to take care of the church's practical needs. ",
  "4027":"Referring to the leading brothers in the church. In taking the lead the first quality needed is diligence. ",
  "4028":"This refers to those who show mercy by sympathizing and rendering help. The showing of mercy is not a natural generosity but a quality formed by transformation. ",
  "4029":"Verses 9-21 and ch. 13 show the normal Christian life that is the necessary base for the practice of the church life and that matches the church life. This life is described in five aspects: (1) toward others (vv. 9-10, 13, 15-16); (2) toward God (v. 11); (3) toward ourselves (v. 12); (4) toward the persecutor and enemy (vv. 14, 17-21); and (5) in general, before all men (v. 17). A life that is complete and proper in these five aspects is a life of surpassing quality with an excellent issue. ",
  "4030":"A presented body, a transformed soul, and a burning spirit &#151; all three are indispensable to a proper church life. After we have presented our body for the church life, it is very easy for us to fall into the opinions of our mind in our soul, which results in our being damaged in the church life; therefore, our soul, and particularly the mind of our soul, needs to be transformed. However, once our mind is transformed, we may easily fall into a negative and dormant state. At that time we must be burning in spirit that we may be stirred up and encouraged to go on in the church life in a positive way. ",
  "4031":"Lit., serving as a slave. See note 1 in ch. 1. ",
  "4032":"Lit., Have fellowship with. This is to care willingly for the needs of the saints according to our ability. The apostle termed this kind of material care \"fellowship,\" because in the sharing of material things the grace of the Lord's life flows among the members of the Body of Christ and is infused into them. ",
  "4033":"As Christians, we are under a blessing. Thus, we should not curse anyone but only bless. The Lord blessed us when we were His enemies (5:10). In the same way, we should bless our enemies and persecutors. ",
  "4034":"To live a normal Christian life for the church life, we need a proper emotion that can rejoice or weep with others. Such an emotion is not a part of our natural life; it is the issue of life through transformation. ",
  "4035":"Or, lowly things. ",
  "4036":"Since we are living not only before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men. ",
  "4037":"God is sovereign. We should not avenge ourselves in any way but should leave the whole situation in the sovereign hand of the Lord, giving Him the ground to do whatever He likes. ",
  "4038":"Lit., soul. ",
  "4039":"The transformation mentioned in 12:2 also governs the Christian life taught in this chapter. Man's natural character is rebellious, but a transformed character is submissive. Subjection to authority requires transformation, which results from the growth in life. ",
  "4040":"Lit., by. After man's fall, God authorized man to act as His deputy authority in ruling over man (Gen. 9:6). To be subject to the authorities is to recognize God's authority and to respect His government over man. Paul's word here implies that he recognized even those officials appointed by Caesar as rulers ordained by God to be God's deputy authorities. ",
  "4041":"God ordains the authorities over man in order to maintain peace and security in human society so that He may have the time and the opportunity to preach the gospel, to save sinners, and to build the church for the spread of His kingdom. ",
  "4042":"Or, punishment, condemnation. ",
  "4043":"The same Greek word as for deacon in 16:1 (there rendered deaconess) and 1 Tim. 3:8.",
  "4044":"Lit., public servants. ",
  "4045":"Love is not merely an outward behavior but is the expression of the inward life. In order to love people and thus spontaneously fulfill the law, we need the transformation in life and the life supply. We need God's life and God's nature of love to transform us and supply us in life, so that in love we may live out this God, who is love, and express His love. ",
  "4046":"Referring to the final step of salvation, the redemption of our body, the full sonship revealed in 8:19, 21, and 23. ",
  "4047":"The present age is the nighttime. When the Lord Jesus returns, day will dawn. The next age, the kingdom age, will be the daytime. ",
  "4048":"Although we have been baptized into Christ and are already in Christ (6:3; Gal. 3:27), we must still put Him on. To put on Christ is to live by Christ (Gal. 2:20) and to live out Christ (Phil. 1:21), thus magnifying Christ (Phil. 1:20). Putting on Christ is the same as putting on the weapons of light (v. 12), indicating that Christ is the weapons of light for the warfare between the Spirit and the lusts. The warfare here is the same as the conflict between the Spirit and the lusts of the flesh (Gal. 5:17). However, it is different from our wrestling against the devil and his evil forces (Eph. 6:12) and from the warfare between the law of sin and the law of good in us (7:23). ",
  "4049":"Or, arrangement. This word has the same root as the Greek word for take forethought in 12:17. To take forethought includes the meaning to provide. To make no provision for the flesh is to not take any forethought for the flesh or provide the flesh with anything that will support it and make it convenient for it to fulfill its lusts. ",
  "4050":"This chapter can be considered a supplement to the constitution of the church life. In setting forth every article, the author's heart was tolerant, his attitude was broad, and his view was noble. In order to practice the church life that he instituted in ch. 12, we must strictly observe the supplement set forth in this chapter. Many saints who love the Lord and seek to live the church life have failed because they were either negligent or mistaken in this matter. ",
  "4051":"To practice the Body life revealed in ch. 12, we must learn the practical lessons of receiving the believers, as revealed particularly in 14:1--15:13, that the church life may be all-inclusive, able to include all kinds of genuine Christians. Such receiving requires the transformation mentioned in ch. 12; if we remain natural, we will be unable to receive those whose views are different from ours in doctrine or in practice. ",
  "4052":"I.e., doctrinal considerations. Except in the matters of idol worship (1 John 5:21; 1 Cor. 8:4-7), fornication, rapaciousness, reviling, and other such gross sins (1 Cor. 5:9-11; 6:9-10), division (16:17; Titus 3:10), and the denial of the incarnation of Christ (2 John 7-11), we must learn not to pass judgments on the doctrinal views of others. As long as one is a genuine Christian and has the fundamental faith of the New Testament, we should not exclude him, even though he may differ from us with respect to doctrine; rather, we should receive him in the same one Lord. ",
  "4053":"Concerning the receiving of the believers, Paul used eating (vv. 2-3) and the keeping of days (vv. 5-6) as examples. God's receiving has nothing to do with what we eat or with our keeping of certain days. These are minor, secondary matters that have nothing to do with our salvation and basic faith. Therefore, we should not despise or judge others in these things. ",
  "4054":"The basis on which we receive the believers is that God has received them. God receives people according to His Son. When a person receives God's Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as his Savior, God receives that person immediately and ushers him into the enjoyment of the Triune God and of all He has prepared and accomplished in Christ for us. We should receive people in the same way and should not be more narrow than God. Regardless of how much they differ from us in doctrinal concepts or religious practices, we must receive them. When we receive people according to God and not according to doctrine or practice, we demonstrate and maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ. ",
  "4055":"The judgment at the judgment seat of God is different from the eternal judgment of God mentioned in 2:2, 3, 5, 16, and 3:8, which will be carried out mainly at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). The eternal judgment at the great white throne will be (1) after the millennium, (2) to judge all the dead unbelievers, and (3) for eternal punishment in the lake of fire. Since this judgment will be executed upon all the condemned sinners, it is mentioned in this book in the section on condemnation. However, the judgment at the judgment seat of God, or the judgment seat of Christ, will be (1) before the millennium, immediately after Christ's coming back, (2) to judge all the resurrected and raptured believers, and (3) for reward or punishment in the millennial kingdom. This judgment will take account of the believers' life and work after they were saved. Since this judgment is very much related to the transformation of the believers, it is mentioned here in this section on transformation. ",
  "4056":"Lit., common. ",
  "4057":"Or, grieved. ",
  "4058":"This verse is a strong proof that the church in the church age is the kingdom of God, because the context here deals with the church life in the present age. The church is a matter of grace and life, whereas the kingdom is a matter of exercise and discipline. ",
  "4059":"The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose. In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper. Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God; with them there should be nothing erroneous, improper, crooked, slanted, or biased. This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves. Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Heb. 12:11 and note). It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God. If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God. <br><br>   According to the context of this chapter, this verse was written for our receiving of the believers. If we receive the believers according to the apostle's instruction in this chapter, we will be right and proper toward those whom we receive and will have peace with them; thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit, proving that we are living in the reality of God's kingdom and are under God's rule. Otherwise, we will not be right or proper toward those whom we do not receive and will not have peace with them; thus, we will not have joy in the Holy Spirit before God, proving that we are not subject to God's authority in the kingdom of God. ",
  "4060":"Lit., serves as a slave. See note 1 in ch. 1. To live in the kingdom of God in the way of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit is to serve Christ as a slave. This is well pleasing to God and approved by men, and it preserves the oneness of the church for the practical Body life. ",
  "4061":"For the proper church life we must pursue the things of peace, the things that keep the oneness of the Body, and we must pursue also the things that build up one another, the things that minister life to our fellow members for mutual building up. ",
  "4062":"In all saved persons there is a measure of God's work. If we cause any one of the believers to stumble because of our doctrinal concepts, we break down, destroy, God's work of grace in him. ",
  "4063":"Or, comfort; so also in v. 5. ",
  "4064":"The preceding verse mentions the Scriptures and the instructions contained in them. However, in the concluding word in this verse, God sets up Christ Jesus as the standard for the church life that we may do everything in the church life according to Him, not taking any doctrine or knowledge as the standard. This will issue in the one accord mentioned in v. 6. ",
  "4065":"The Greek word means with the same mind, will, and purpose. This is to be one in our whole being and results in our being one in our outward speaking. Whenever we are in one accord, we speak the same thing; we speak with one mouth. This oneness is the reverse of Babel, where the division among mankind caused their language to become confused and divided into many different speakings (Gen. 11:7, 9). The only way to be with one accord and one mouth is to allow Christ the room to be everything in our heart and in our mouth that God may be glorified. ",
  "4066":"Verse 3 of ch. 14 says that we should receive people according to God's receiving, but here we are told that we should receive people according to Christ's receiving. Christ's receiving is God's receiving. What Christ has received, God has received. Those whom God and Christ have received we must receive, regardless of how they differ from us in doctrine or practice. This will be to the glory of God. ",
  "4067":"The same Greek word as for deacon in 16:1 (there rendered deaconess) and 1 Tim. 3:8. In vv. 8-9 Christ is shown to be the servant of both the circumcision (the Jews) and the nations (the Gentiles). For the Jews, Christ is a servant for the sake of God's truthfulness, to fulfill and confirm all the promises God gave to their fathers. For the Gentiles, Christ is a servant so that the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. ",
  "4068":"See note 7 in ch. 3. Christ has become a servant of the circumcision to confirm the promises God gave to the fathers. This is to prove God's truthfulness. ",
  "4069":"Or, confess. ",
  "4070":"Although Christ is the root of Jesse (David's father, signifying the Jewish people), He will also be the ruler of the Gentiles. The apostle quoted this word and the word in vv. 9-11 to prove that Christ brings together the Gentiles and the Jews. Since Christ is such an all-embracing Lord (Acts 10:36), bringing together the Jews and the Gentiles, we must receive all the different believers according to Him. ",
  "4071":"Lit., public servant; as in 13:6. ",
  "4072":"In Greek, from the same root as energizing. ",
  "4073":"Paul's being a priest of the gospel of God to minister Christ to the Gentiles was a priestly service to God, and the Gentiles whom he gained through his gospel preaching were an offering presented to God. By this priestly service many Gentiles, who were unclean and defiled, were sanctified in the Holy Spirit and became such an offering, acceptable to God. They were set apart from things common and were saturated with God's nature and element, and were thus sanctified both positionally and dispositionally (see note 19 in ch. 6). Such a sanctification is in the Holy Spirit. This means that, based on Christ's redemption, the Holy Spirit renews, transforms, and separates unto holiness those who have been regenerated by believing into Christ. ",
  "4074":"See note 2 in ch. 5. ",
  "4075":"A region in southeast Europe adjacent to Macedonia. This shows Paul's widespread preaching of the gospel. He desired to travel even farther, all the way to Spain (v. 24). ",
  "4076":"Lit., fulfilled. ",
  "4077":"At that time Paul probably considered Spain the uttermost part of the earth, as mentioned in Acts 1:8. ",
  "4078":"The Greek word means serving as a deacon. ",
  "4079":"Lit., fellowship. The Greek word denotes participation and fellowship. The same word is translated fellowship in Phil. 1:5 and sharing in Heb. 13:16, and is from the same root as contribute in 12:13 of this book. The fellowship of love, the fellowship in love between the Gentile and the Jewish saints, developed out of the ministering of Christ to the Gentiles and the offering of the Gentiles as a sacrifice to God. Paul went to the Gentiles with Christ; now he was returning to the Jews with the fellowship of the Gentile saints in material things. This fellowship of love was the practical result of Paul's ministry. ",
  "4080":"The Greek word denotes the service performed by priests and Levites in the temple. It is the same word as for ministering in Heb. 10:11. In v. 16 Paul's thought was that he was a priest. Here he might have had the thought that the Gentiles were serving as Levites. ",
  "4081":"Paul went to the Gentiles with Christ, returned to the Jewish brothers with material possessions, and expected to visit Rome in the fullness of the blessing of Christ to minister the riches of Christ to the people there. This shows us the proper church life. Through the apostle, the church life was being filled with Christ, filled with love in the fellowship of material possessions, and filled with the mutual participation in the blessing of Christ's fullness. ",
  "4082":"The Greek word denotes the service of a deacon. In v. 25 and in this verse Paul might have had the thought that he was serving as a deacon.",
  "4083":"As the conclusion of this book, this chapter consists entirely of recommendations and greetings. It speaks not only of the concern among the saints but also of the fellowship among the churches (vv. 1, 4-5, 16, 23), showing some of the conditions that should exist in the local churches as the fourth station revealed in this book (see note 1 second par.) and as the conclusion of the revelation in this book. This strengthens the content and significance of this chapter, which not only contains recommendations and greetings but, even more, presents a display of the local churches. ",
  "4084":"The term church is not used in this book until 16:1. In this chapter the church and the churches are mentioned five times (vv. 1, 4-5, 16, 23). This is a strong indication that many matters covered in chs. 1--15 concerning God's complete salvation are for the producing and building up of the church. These matters include the Triune God Himself (8:31), as the Father (1:7; 8:15), as the Son (1:4; 8:3) (the Son being the Lord &#151; 1:4, 7; 10:12; 14:9; being Jesus &#151; 3:26; 4:24; being Christ &#151; 5:6; 6:4; 8:34; 6:3; 8:10; 13:14; being the man &#151; 5:15; and being the root of Jesse &#151; 15:12), and as the Spirit (5:5; 8:16, 26) (the Spirit being the firstfruits &#151; 8:23); His mercy (9:23; 11:32), His compassion (9:15; 12:1), His love (5:5; 8:35, 39), His kindness (2:4; 11:22), His grace (5:2, 15), His free gifts (5:15-16; 11:29), His gifts (12:6), His righteousness (1:17; 3:21), His Spirit of holiness (1:4), His faithfulness (3:3), His peace (15:33; 16:20), His hope (15:13), His joy (15:13), His endurance (15:5), His encouragement (15:5), His riches (10:12; 11:33), His wisdom (11:33), His knowledge (11:33), His power (1:16), His authority (9:21), His life (5:21), His law of life (8:2), His sonship (8:15), His glory (5:2; 9:23), and His kingdom (14:17); His foreknowing (8:29), His selection (9:11; 11:5), His predestination (8:29), His preparation (9:23), His reserving (11:4-5), His calling (8:30; 11:29), His grafting (11:17), His redemption (3:24), His propitiation (3:25), His salvation (1:16), His justification (3:26, 30), His reconciliation (5:10-11), His freedom (8:2), His sanctification (6:19, 22), His transformation (12:2), His renewing (12:2), His conformation (8:29), His redemption of our body (8:23), and His glorification (8:30); His receiving (14:3; 15:7), His indwelling (8:11), His life giving (8:11), His leading (8:14), His witnessing (8:16), His helping (8:26), His interceding within us (8:26), His interceding in the heavens (8:34), His giving all things to us (8:32), and His causing all things to work for us (8:28); plus His incarnation (1:3; 10:6), His crucifixion (5:8; 6:6), His blood (3:25), His ending of the law (10:4), His resurrection (4:25; 10:7), and His ascension (8:34). All have been made available, and most of these have been applied to the producing and building up of the church for the fulfillment of God's purpose according to His will (12:2). <br><br>   Four stations are revealed in this book: the matters covered in chs. 1--4 bring us in ch. 4 to the first station, the station of justification; chs. 5--8 lead us in ch. 8 to the second station, the station of sanctification; chs. 9--12 lead us in ch. 12 to the third station, the station of the Body of Christ; and chs. 14--16 take us in ch. 16 to the fourth station, the station of the churches expressed in different localities, the station of the practical living of the Body of Christ in different localities. The churches are the ultimate consummation of the complete salvation of the gospel of God revealed in this book, which was written not in the way of doctrine but in the way of practicality. In the first station we are regenerated and saved, in the second station we are sanctified, in the third station we are renewed and transformed, and in the fourth station, in the practical church life, Satan is crushed under our feet and we are able to fully enjoy the Lord's grace and God's peace (v. 20). ",
  "4085":"I.e., worthy of her status as a saint. Verse 7 of ch. 1 says that the saints are called by God and separated from all things other than God to be a special people sanctified unto God, and as such they are noble and not common. Therefore, the apostle asked the saints in Rome to receive Phoebe as a noble saint, to receive her in a manner worthy of her noble status. ",
  "4086":"Or, protectress. It is a word of dignity, denoting one who helps, sustains, and supplies. It indicates the high esteem with which Phoebe was regarded because of her service in the church life in Cenchrea. ",
  "4087":"Prisca and Aquila were absolute for the local churches. Their only interest was the church, and they were willing to risk their necks, to be martyred, for the apostles. ",
  "4088":"Lit., soul. ",
  "4089":"The Body of Christ as the universal church is unique (Eph. 1:23; 4:3). When this universal church appears in many localities on earth, it becomes the many churches. Therefore, this verse refers to the churches. The churches exist in various localities that all the saints may live the church life and have the practice of the church in the locality where they are. ",
  "4090":"The church in Prisca and Aquila's house must have been the church in Rome. When they were living in Ephesus (Acts 18:18-19), the church in Ephesus was in their house (1 Cor. 16:19). Wherever they were, they were willing to bear the burden of the practice of the church by opening their home. ",
  "4091":"Showing that the early saints met primarily in their houses. Such a practice corresponds with Acts 2:46 (see note 3 there) and 5:42. ",
  "4092":"Lit., approved by testing. ",
  "4093":"According to the structure and the tone of these expressions, those of the households of Aristobulus and Narcissus could not be members of the families of the two men; they were most likely the slaves of the two men, respectively. According to the ancient custom, slaves were considered the property of their buyers. It is unlikely that the two masters, Aristobulus and Narcissus, were believers, because they were not greeted here. At that time a number of those who had been sold as slaves and had lost their freedom believed in Christ and became saints, but the masters who bought them were not yet believers. ",
  "4094":"See note 10. ",
  "4095":"Rufus was a brother in Rome, and his mother also was in Rome. Paul's referring to her as his own mother was a sign of respect and intimacy. ",
  "4096":"The churches are not the personal possession or private work of anyone. They are the churches of Christ. ",
  "4097":"Referring to being stumbled and leaving the church life. This must be the result of different opinions and teachings. ",
  "4098":"In ch. 14 Paul was liberal and gracious regarding the receiving of those who differ in doctrine or practice. Here, however, he is unyielding and resolute in saying that we must turn away from those who are dissenting, who make divisions, and who make causes of stumbling. The purpose in both cases is the preserving of the oneness of the Body of Christ that we may have the normal church life. ",
  "4099":"Lit., serve as slaves. ",
  "4100":"The Greek word is a derivative of the word meaning hollow. It refers to the stomach or to the entire abdominal cavity. ",
  "4101":"Or, unsuspecting, innocent. ",
  "4102":"Here God promises that He will crush Satan under the feet of those who live the church life, showing that the crushing of Satan is related to the church life. Dealing with Satan is a Body matter, not an individual matter. It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet. ",
  "4103":"The church life enables us not only to crush Satan under our feet and to experience the God of peace but also to enjoy the rich grace of the Lord. ",
  "4104":"Some ancient MSS add v. 24, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. ",
  "4105":"See note 10 in 1 Pet. 5. In ch. 16 our need is no longer to be saved or to be sanctified but to be established. Since everything has been accomplished, we need only to be established. This establishing is according to the pure and full gospel of God, that is, the proclaiming and ministering of the all-inclusive Christ, and according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages. Only the pure gospel, the living Christ, and God's revealed mystery can establish us and keep us in oneness for the church life. ",
  "4106":"I.e., the full gospel, including the teaching concerning Christ and the church and consummating in the local churches, as fully disclosed in this book. See note 1 in ch. 1. ",
  "4107":"The mystery of God, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages, is mainly of two aspects: the mystery of God, which is Christ (Col. 2:2), who is in the believers (Col. 1:26-27) as their life and their everything that they may become the members of His Body; and the mystery of Christ, which is the church as His Body (Eph. 3:4-6) to express His fullness (Eph. 1:22-23). Therefore, Christ and the church are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). ",
  "4108":"Referring to the time since the beginning of the world. ",
  "4109":"In chs. 15 and 16 God is called \"the God of endurance and encouragement\" (15:5), \"the God of hope\" (15:13), \"the God of peace\" (v. 20), \"the eternal God\" (v. 26), and \"the only wise God\" (v. 27). Our God is rich in all these aspects, and the gospel in this book is the gospel of such a rich God. This gospel consummates in the practical church life. ",
  "4110":"See note 33 in ch. 11. In its conclusion this book, which gives a general discussion concerning the Christian life and the church life, gives glory to the wise God. This unveils that all the matters discussed in this book, such as how God selects us, how He saves us from sin and death, how He redeems us and justifies us, how He makes us, sinners who were dead through and through, His divine sons, how He transfers us out of Adam into Christ, how He sanctifies and transforms us in Christ, how He makes us the members of Christ for the constituting of the Body of Christ, and how He causes us to be the local churches appearing in different localities as the expressions of the Body of Christ on the earth in this age &#151; all these matters are planned, managed, and accomplished by God's wisdom, in order that He, the unlimitedly rich Triune God, may be glorified, that is, that His incomparable glory may be completely and fully expressed through us who have been perfected eternally by Him and who have become His Body and have been joined to Him as one. The focus of God's wisdom is the working of His Divine Trinity into the three parts &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; of our redeemed being that in His redemption, sanctification, and transformation we may have a full union in the divine life with Him, that His desire for the mingling of divinity and humanity, the joining of humanity to divinity, may be fulfilled for eternity. This truly is worthy of our appreciation and worship! How blessed and how glorious it is that we can participate in this! This is worthy of our unceasing singing and praise for eternity! Both our Christian life and our church life should have this as our center and goal. May God bless in this way everyone who has been chosen and perfected by Him. <br><br>   Through God's divine dispensing in us and His divine union with us, we can experience and enjoy the saving in Christ's life in God's full salvation (see note 10 in ch. 5), as conveyed to us in this book, in the following aspects: <br><br>   (1) By the abundance of grace (God Himself) and of the gift of righteousness (Christ Himself) which we received, we are able to reign in Christ's divine life (5:17) over sin, death, the old man, the flesh, Satan, the world, and all persons, matters, and things that do not submit to God. <br><br>   (2) God's holy nature sanctifies our worldly disposition (6:19, 22; 15:16). God sanctifies us dispositionally out of His divine life and unto His divine life that we may enjoy more of His divine life. <br><br>   (3) The indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the automatic and spontaneous working of the Triune God as life in us, frees us from the law of sin and of death, the slavery and bondage of sin (8:2, 11). The operation of this law comes out of God's divine life, and it also causes the increase of the divine life in us. <br><br>   (4) The Divine Trinity's divine dispensing in our spirit, soul, and body causes these three parts to be saturated with the processed divine life (8:5-11), with the result that our entire being is completely united with the processed Triune God and mingled with Him as one. <br><br>   (5) The renewing of our mind by the Spirit results in the transformation of our soul, which saves us from being conformed to the modern style of the world (12:2) and issues in all the virtues and the overcoming, mentioned in chs. 12--16, as our daily life, a life of the highest standard, and as our church life, a life that is all-overcoming. <br><br>   (6) By the renewing of our mind and the transformation of our soul, we become members one of another with all believers in the Body of Christ and are built up together as the Body of Christ and thereby have the service of the Body (12:1, 3-8). This is the crystallization of our experience of the saving in Christ's life. <br><br>   (7) Based on the revelation and teaching in chs. 14--16 of this book, we live the life of the local church in different localities as the appearance of the Body of Christ, the universal church, in different localities. <br><br>   (8) By becoming the built-up church, a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail, in different localities, we afford God the opportunity to crush Satan under our feet that we may enjoy Christ as our rich grace and the God of peace as our surpassing peace (16:20). <br><br>   (9) In our experience of the various aspects of the saving in the divine life, as mentioned above, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (8:28-29) through the \"all things\" arranged under God's sovereignty, so that we have His divine attributes and His human virtues and thereby express the glory and beauty of Him, the God-man. <br><br>   (10) In the process of our experience of the saving in the divine life, the splendor of the divine life gradually saturates us until it saturates our body, issuing in the redemption of our body (8:23), that our spirit, soul, and body may all enter into the glory of God (8:30, 17). This glorification is the peak attained in us by the saving in the divine life, and it is the climax of God's full salvation. ",
  "4111":"An apostle is a sent one. Paul was such a one, not self-appointed but called by the Lord. His apostleship was authentic (9:1-5; 2 Cor. 12:11-12; cf. 2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2), having the authority of God's New Testament administration (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10). Based on this position with this authority the apostle wrote this Epistle, not only to nourish and build up the saints in Corinth but also to regulate and adjust the church there. ",
  "4112":"The will of God is His determination for the carrying out of His purpose. Through this will Paul was called to be an apostle of Christ. Paul's assertion here strengthened his apostolic position and authority. ",
  "4113":"Sosthenes here was probably not the same Sosthenes as in Acts 18:17, because this Epistle was written in Ephesus (16:8) not long after the apostle left Corinth, where the other Sosthenes was a ruler of the synagogue when Paul was persecuted there. This Sosthenes, as a brother in the Lord, must have gone out together with the apostle for the ministry. The mentioning of him here strengthened Paul's apostleship and points out the principle of the Body. ",
  "4114":"The church of God! Not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, or of any practice or doctrine, but of God. In spite of all the division, sin, confusion, abusing of gifts, and heretical teaching in the church in Corinth, the apostle still called it \"the church of God\" because the divine and spiritual essence which makes the assembled believers the church of God was actually there. Such a spiritual address by the apostle was based on his spiritual view in looking upon the church in Christ. Such a simple address alone should have eliminated all the division and confusion in both practice and doctrine. ",
  "4115":"The church is constituted of the universal God, but it exists on earth in many localities, one of which was Corinth. In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place. Hence, the church has two aspects: the universal and the local. Without the universal aspect, the church is void of content; without the local aspect, it is impossible for the church to have any expression and practice. Hence, the New Testament stresses the local aspect of the church also (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11; etc.). ",
  "4116":"To the church of God equals to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus. This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints and that the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church. ",
  "4117":"I.e., made holy, separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. See note 2 in Rom. 1. ",
  "4118":"In Christ means in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us, made us holy, unto God when we believed into Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him. ",
  "4119":"The believers in Christ are the called saints, not called to be saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition. See note 19 in Rom. 6. ",
  "4120":"Not and but with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place. This indicates (1) that a local church, such as the church in Corinth, is composed only of those believers in that locality, not of all believers in every place, and (2) that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in that one church in Corinth but for all believers in every place. This Epistle is for all believers of whatever place or time. ",
  "4121":"To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe into Him (Rom. 10:14). All believers in the Lord should be His callers (Acts 9:14, 21; 22:16). We have been called to call, called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. ",
  "4122":"Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers. He is our allotted portion given to us by God (Col. 1:12). The apostle added this special phrase at the end of this verse to stress the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of all believers in whatever place or situation. In this Epistle the apostle's intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth. For all the problems, especially the matter of division, the only solution is the all-inclusive Christ. We have all been called into the fellowship of, the participation in, Him (v. 9). All believers should be focused on Him, not being distracted by any gifted person, any overstressed doctrine, or any particular practice. ",
  "4123":"The apostle's giving of thanks to God for the Corinthian believers was based on the grace of God given to them in Christ, not on their condition in themselves. ",
  "4124":"Gk. logos, i.e., word; the word that gives utterance to the thought formed in the mind. The word of the gospel preached by the apostle conveys the thought of God to our understanding. Hence, the word is the expression, the utterance, of the divine thought. Knowledge is the apprehension, the realization, of what is conveyed and uttered in the word. The Corinthian believers were enriched by the grace of God in all utterance of the divine thought concerning Christ and in all apprehension and realization in knowing Christ. ",
  "4125":"This was the preaching of Christ by the apostle, not merely with objective doctrines but with subjective experiences, as a witness bearing a living testimony of Christ. Such a testimony of Christ was confirmed within and among the Corinthian believers by their being enriched in Christ, as mentioned in vv. 4 and 5. ",
  "4126":"Or, among. ",
  "4127":"Gift here refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38) as the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4). It does not refer to the outward, miraculous gifts, such as healing, speaking in tongues, etc., mentioned in chs. 12 and 14. All the inward gifts are constituents of grace. They are the initial things of the divine life that are received of grace. All these need to grow (3:6-7) to their full development and maturity. The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life, but they were desperately short of the growth in life. Hence, however much they had been initially enriched in grace, they were still infants in Christ, soulish, fleshly, and even fleshy (2:14; 3:1, 3). ",
  "4128":"Referring to the Lord's second coming. To await the appearing of the Lord is a normal sign of true believers.",
  "4129":"Referring to God in v. 4. The very God who has initially given us grace will also confirm us until the end. ",
  "4130":"This indicates that after the initial receiving of grace, we the believers need to grow in life. ",
  "4131":"See note 16 in Phil. 2. ",
  "4132":"This word is a continuation of v. 8, strengthening the thought with the assurance of God's faithfulness. In His faithfulness God will confirm the believers until the end, making them unreprovable in the day of the Lord's return. ",
  "4133":"I.e., to partake of the fellowship of the union with God's Son, Jesus Christ, and of the participation in Him. God has called us into such a fellowship that we may enjoy Christ as our God-given portion. This word, like the word in v. 2 concerning Christ's being theirs and ours, stresses again the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially the problem of division. <br><br>   This book unveils to us that the very Christ, into whom we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is the portion given to us by God (v. 2). He is God's power and God's wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (vv. 24, 30). He is the Lord of glory (2:8) for our glorification (2:7; Rom. 8:30). He is the depths (deep things) of God (2:10). He is the unique foundation of God's building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruits (15:20, 23), the second man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45) that we may receive Him into us as our everything. This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least twenty items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God, that all the problems among the believers may be solved. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. This fellowship of God's Son became the fellowship that the apostles shared with the believers (Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3) in His Body, the church, and should be the fellowship that we enjoy in partaking of His blood and His body at His table (10:16, 21). Such a fellowship, which is carried out by the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14), must be unique because He is unique; it forbids any division among the members of His unique Body. ",
  "4134":"With this verse the apostle began to deal with the divisions among the Corinthians. First, he besought them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names (Phil. 2:9) and should be the unique name among all His believers. However, the divisive Corinthians ranked the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, just as Peter on the mount of transfiguration ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ (Matt. 17:1-8). To keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name. ",
  "4135":"Because of their different speakings in their strife, which were condemned by the apostle in vv. 11-12. ",
  "4136":"In this Epistle the apostle dealt with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth. The first was the matter of division. Division is nearly always the leading problem, bringing in all other problems among believers. It may be considered the root of the problems among believers. Hence, in dealing with all the problems in the church at Corinth, the apostle's axe first touched the root, that is, the divisions among the believers there. The first virtue of the believers' walk that is worthy of God's calling is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:1-6). ",
  "4137":"The same word in Greek that is translated mending in Matt. 4:21. It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together. The Corinthian believers as a whole were divided, broken. They needed to be mended in order to be joined perfectly together that they might be in harmony, having the same mind and the same opinion to speak the same thing, that is, Christ and His cross (vv. 17-18, 22-24; 2:2). ",
  "4138":"Or, judgment. ",
  "4139":"A female name; hence, a sister in the Lord. ",
  "4140":"This is exactly the same as saying \"I am a Lutheran,\" \"I am a Wesleyan,\" \"I am a Presbyterian,\" \"I am an Episcopalian,\" \"I am a Baptist,\" etc. All such designations should be condemned and rejected. They can be eliminated and terminated only by taking Christ as the unique center among all the believers. ",
  "4141":"To say \"I am of Christ\" in the way of excluding the apostles and their teachings or of excluding other believers is as divisive as to say \"I am of\" this or that. ",
  "4142":"Christ is unique and is not divided. This unique and undivided Christ, taken as the unique center among all the believers, should be the termination of all divisions. ",
  "4143":"The One who was crucified for us should be the One to whom all the believers belong. This surely is Christ, not anyone else. All believers were baptized into the name, that is, into the person, of the crucified and resurrected Christ, issuing in an organic union with Him. His unique name and unique person cannot be replaced by the name and person of any of His servants. ",
  "4144":"The apostle Paul was sent not to baptize people in a formal way but to preach the gospel, ministering Christ to others for the producing of the church as an expression of Christ to be the fullness of God (Eph. 1:23; 3:19). ",
  "4145":"Referring to philosophical speculations. ",
  "4146":"The cross of Christ is the center in the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy, which is to have a church produced through the redemption of Christ. Paul preached Christ crucified (v. 23; 2:2; Gal. 3:1) and boasted in the cross of Christ (Gal. 6:14). He did not preach the law with circumcision, which the Jews and some of the Jewish believers fought for (Gal. 3:11; 5:11; 6:12-13), nor the philosophy that was promoted by the Greeks and some of the Gentile believers (Col. 2:8, 20). The cross of Christ abolished the ordinances of the law (Eph. 2:15; Col. 2:14), and we the believers have died to philosophy, an element of the world (Col. 2:20). But Satan instigated the Judaizers and the Greek philosophers to preach their isms of worldly wisdom that the cross of Christ might be made void. The apostle Paul was alert in this matter. In dealing with the divisions among the Corinthian believers, which came mainly from the background of Jewish religion and Greek philosophy, the apostle stressed Christ and His cross. When Christ is taken to replace religious opinions and philosophical wisdom, and when His cross is working to deal with the flesh attached to any background, divisions will be terminated. The exaltation of natural preference and human wisdom cannot stand before Christ and His cross. ",
  "4147":"The same word in Greek that is translated utterance in v. 5 (see note there). The word of the cross is the utterance, the speaking, the preaching, of the cross. Such preaching is despised and considered foolishness by those who are perishing, but it is honored and received as the power of God by us who are being saved. In his ministry Paul stressed the cross as the center of God's salvation (Gal. 2:20; 3:1; 5:11, 24; 6:14; Eph. 2:16; Phil. 2:8; 3:18; Col. 2:14). ",
  "4148":"Referring in particular to the philosophical Greeks in Corinth, who considered themselves wise and prudent in holding to their philosophical wisdom. The apostle desired that they leave their philosophy and take the crucified Christ instead. ",
  "4149":"Like the wisdom of the scribes in Isa. 33:18, the wisdom of the Jewish scribes, who rejected the word of the cross, was considered futile by Paul. ",
  "4150":"Or, thought well. ",
  "4151":"I.e., the thing preached. ",
  "4152":"A sign is a miraculous token (Matt. 12:38-39) given to substantiate what is preached. Religion needs signs, and the Jews continually required them. Wisdom pertains to philosophy and was constantly sought by the Greeks. ",
  "4153":"Christ crucified &#151; weak, despised, and rejected &#151; was a stumbling block to the miracle-seeking religious Jews and foolishness to the wisdom-seeking philosophical Greeks, yet this Christ was just the One they both needed to solve all their problems dealt with in this book. ",
  "4154":"Referring to those who were chosen by God in eternity (Eph. 1:4) and who believed in Christ in time (Acts 13:48). ",
  "4155":"The crucified Christ preached by the apostles is the power of God and the wisdom of God. Wisdom is for planning, purposing; power is for carrying out, accomplishing, what is planned and purposed. In God's economy Christ is both. ",
  "4156":"Or, highborn, noble; i.e., born of a noble or royal family. The church of God is composed not mainly of the upper class but of the lowborn of the world and the despised. To appreciate the upper class is against God's mind and is a shame to the church. ",
  "4157":"God's calling (vv. 24-26) is based on God's choosing, God's selection. Both are according to His purpose (Rom. 9:11; 2 Tim. 1:9). God's choosing was ordained before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4); His calling is accomplished in time, to carry out His choosing. God's calling and choosing are the initiation of the salvation of His predestinated people. We did not choose Him; He chose us. We did not call upon Him until He called us. He is the Initiator. All the glory should be to Him! ",
  "4158":"I.e., born of common people; in contrast to the wellborn in v. 26. ",
  "4159":"Or, contemptible. The Greek word is of the same root as the word for counted as nothing in Mark 9:12. ",
  "4160":"I.e., are as if they have no existence. The lowborn and the despised are of no account in the world. ",
  "4161":"The repetition of God has chosen three times in vv. 27 and 28 unveils to us God's sovereign dealing with the three kinds of people of the world mentioned in v. 26 &#151; the wise, the strong (the powerful), and the wellborn. The wellborn, \"things which are,\" are counted much in the world but are brought to nought by God in His economy. ",
  "4162":"This declares the reason for God's particular favor in His choosing us, that is, that no flesh, no human being, may have any boast, any glory, before Him. ",
  "4163":"What we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves. It is God who put us in Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ. It is God who made Christ wisdom to us. ",
  "4164":"Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God's salvation: (1) righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18); (2) sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, i.e., transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life (Rom. 6:19, 22); and (3) redemption (for our future), i.e., the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire being &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves, that we may boast and glory in Him, not in ourselves. ",
  "4165":"Or, superiority. Paul came to Corinth not to display his excellent, superior speech or philosophical wisdom in announcing the mystery of God. ",
  "4166":"Some ancient authorities read, testimony. What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ (Rom. 16:25-26; Col. 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 3:4-6, 9). ",
  "4167":"The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle's ministry. For this he did not determine to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ, and this One crucified, when he was going to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks. What a determination! It should be a pattern to us all. ",
  "4168":"Jesus Christ denotes the Lord's person. This One crucified speaks of the example of the Lord's living, action, work, and way, indicating His humiliation and abasement. In order to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom, Paul did not refer here to the Lord's resurrection in glory (Luke 24:26) and His ascension in exaltation (Acts 2:33, 36). ",
  "4169":"Referring to the apostle's physical weakness, which was due, perhaps, to his physical sufferings in his persecutions for the gospel. He did not display himself as a physically strong man while among the Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in their philosophies but also physically in their gymnastics. ",
  "4170":"Fear is the inward feeling; trembling is the outward appearance. The apostle was inwardly in fear of missing Christ in his ministry to the wisdom-seeking Greeks, and outwardly in trembling lest he be influenced by their prevailing aspiration for wisdom. By such fear and trembling he stood faithfully and steadfastly in his God-appointed ministry, according to the heavenly vision, avoiding any deviation. The religious Jews were proud of their traditional religion, and the philosophical Greeks were haughty in their worldly wisdom. In ministering Christ to both, the apostle was in fear and in much trembling. What a contrast between him and them! ",
  "4171":"Persuasive words of wisdom issue from the human mind; demonstration of the Spirit comes forth from the spirit. The apostle's speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit and, hence, of power. ",
  "4172":"Lit., be. ",
  "4173":"The wisdom of men is the elementary philosophy; the power of God is the all-inclusive Christ (1:24). ",
  "4174":"I.e., destroyed (the same word as in 1:28). ",
  "4175":"God's wisdom is Christ (1:24), who is the hidden mystery (Col. 1:26-27), predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory. ",
  "4176":"I.e., in eternity. ",
  "4177":"Christ, who is the Lord of glory (v. 8). Christ is our life today (Col. 3:4) and our glory in the future (Col. 1:27). To this glory God has called us (1 Pet. 5:10), and into it He will bring us (Heb. 2:10). This is the goal of God's salvation. ",
  "4178":"The sphere of what the eye can see is narrow; the sphere of what the ear can hear is broader; and the sphere of what the heart can realize is without limitation. God in His wisdom (that is, in Christ) has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification. All these the human eye has never seen, the human ear has never heard, and the human heart has never realized. ",
  "4179":"Lit., on, or upon. ",
  "4180":"To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God (that is, to receive God) are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement. To love God means to set our entire being &#151; spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30) &#151; absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God. ",
  "4181":"Different from taught. To be taught is related to our mind; to have something revealed to us is related to our spirit. To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, which have never come up in man's heart. ",
  "4182":"The Greek word is used in reference to active research, implying accurate knowledge gained not by discovering but by exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. ",
  "4183":"Referring to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. These have never arisen in man's heart but are revealed to us in our spirit by God's Spirit. Hence, in order to partake of them, we must be spiritual. We must move, act, and live in our spirit that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us. ",
  "4184":"The spirit of man is the deepest part of man's being. It has the faculty to penetrate the innermost region of the things of man, whereas the mind of man is capable of knowing only superficial things. So also, only the Spirit of God can know the deep things of God. The Corinthian believers had neglected the spirit of man and the Spirit of God, having turned instead to live in their mind by philosophy. Hence, this book shows that the proper experience of these two spirits is essential for the practice of the church life. ",
  "4185":"Praise the Lord that we, those who have been born of God by His Spirit, have received the Spirit of God. Hence, we are well able to know the deep things of God, which He has graciously given to us for our enjoyment.",
  "4186":"The Greek word means mixing or putting together, as in interpreting or expounding. It is common in the Septuagint: Gen. 40:8; 41:12, 15. ",
  "4187":"The thought here is to speak spiritual things with spiritual words. The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken. The apostle spoke the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, with spiritual words, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit. ",
  "4188":"Verse 13 stresses the spiritual means, that is, the spiritual words with which the spiritual things are spoken. Verses 14 and 15 stress the spiritual object, that is, a spiritual man (not a soulish man), who is able to discern the spiritual things. Both the means and the object need to be spiritual. The spiritual things must be spoken with spiritual words to the spiritual man. ",
  "4189":"A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul (including the mind, the emotion, and the will) to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring his spirit, not using his spirit, and even behaving as if he did not have a spirit (Jude 19). Such a man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, and he is not able to know them. Rather, he rejects them. The religious Jews, who required signs, and the philosophical Greeks, who sought wisdom (1:22), were such natural men, to whom the things of the Spirit of God were foolishness (1:23). ",
  "4190":"Referring to the deep things of God concerning Christ as our portion. ",
  "4191":"A soulish man does not have the constitutional capacity for spiritual perception. Hence, he is not able to know spiritual things. ",
  "4192":"Or, examined, investigated; and thus made clear as to the truth of the matter. ",
  "4193":"Spiritually here refers to the spirit of man that is moved by the Spirit of God to fully exercise its function and thereby replace the human soul's rule and control over man. It is only by such a spirit that man can discern the things of the Spirit of God. A man who is ruled and controlled by his spirit is a spiritual man, as mentioned in the next verse. Since God is Spirit, all the things of the Spirit of God are spiritual. Therefore, to discern, to know, the things of the Spirit of God, man must use the human spirit (John 4:24). ",
  "4194":"A spiritual man is one who denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit, that is, his regenerated spirit, which is occupied and energized by the Spirit of God, to dominate his entire being. Furthermore, he lives by such a spirit, moving and acting according to it (Rom. 8:4). Such a spiritual person is able to discern the things of the Spirit of God because his constitutional capacity for spiritual perception is able to manifest its function. ",
  "4195":"Because we are organically one with Christ, we have all the faculties that He has. The mind is the faculty of intelligence, the understanding organ. We have such an organ, the mind of Christ; hence, we can know what He knows. We have not only the life of Christ but also the mind of Christ. Christ must saturate our mind from our spirit, making our mind one with His. ",
  "4196":"A spiritual man is one who does not behave according to the flesh or act according to the soulish life but lives according to the spirit, that is, his spirit mingled with the Spirit of God. Such a man is dominated, governed, directed, moved, and led by such a mingled spirit. ",
  "4197":"This is a stronger and more gross expression than fleshly in v. 3. Fleshy denotes being made of flesh; fleshly denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh. In this verse the apostle considered the Corinthian believers to be totally of the flesh, to be made of the flesh, and to be just the flesh. What a strong word! Then in v. 3 the apostle condemned their behaving in jealousy and strife as fleshly, as being under the influence of their fleshly nature and partaking of the character of the flesh. <br><br>   This book reveals clearly that a believer may be one of three kinds of men: (1) a spiritual man, living in his spirit under the anointing of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:25); (2) a soulish man, living in his soul under the direction of the soul, the natural life (2:14); or (3) a fleshy and fleshly man, being of the flesh and living in the flesh under the influence of the nature of the flesh. The Lord desires that all His believers take His grace to be the first kind of man &#151; a spiritual man. This was the goal of this book: to motivate the Corinthian believers who were soulish, fleshy, and fleshly to aspire to the growth in life that they might become spiritual (2:15; 3:1; 14:37). As we have been called by God into the fellowship of Christ (1:9), who is now the life-giving Spirit (15:45), and as we are one spirit with Him (6:17), we can experience and enjoy Him only when we live in our spirit under the leading of the Holy Spirit. When we live in the soul or in the flesh, we cannot participate in Him or enjoy Him. ",
  "4198":"Although the Corinthian believers had received all the initial gifts in life and were lacking in none of them (1:7), they did not grow in life after receiving them but remained infants in Christ, those who were not spiritual but fleshy. The apostle here pointed out their deficiency and their need, which was to grow in life to maturity, to be full-grown (2:6; Col. 1:28). ",
  "4199":"To give milk to drink or food to eat is to feed others. Feeding is a matter of life; it differs from teaching, which is a matter of knowledge. What the apostle ministered to the Corinthian believers seemed to be knowledge; actually, it was milk (not yet solid food), and it should have nourished them. ",
  "4200":"Milk is mainly for infants; solid food is for the mature. See notes 12 and 13 in Heb. 5. ",
  "4201":"This indicates that the Corinthian believers were not growing in life; they were still not able to receive solid food. ",
  "4202":"Jealousy and strife are expressions, characteristics, of the nature of the flesh. Hence, they show that those who are in the flesh are fleshly and that they walk according to the manner of man. ",
  "4203":"Every fallen man is just the flesh (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16 and note 2). Hence, to be according to the manner of man is to be according to the flesh. The jealousy and strife among the Corinthian believers show that they walked according to the flesh of the fallen man and not according to the human spirit regenerated by God. Hence, they were not spiritual but fleshly, and they walked not according to God but according to the manner of man. ",
  "4204":"To plant, to water, and to cause to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates that the believers are God's cultivated land (v. 9) to grow Christ. The ministers of Christ can only plant and water. Only God can cause the growth. The Corinthian believers overesteemed the planter and the waterer and neglected the One who causes the growth. Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life. <br><br>   The Corinthian believers, under the prevailing influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge, neglecting life. In this chapter Paul's intention was to turn their attention from knowledge to life, pointing out that to them he was a feeder and a planter; Apollos, a waterer; and God, the One who causes the growth. In 4:15 he even told them that he was their spiritual father, who begot them in Christ through the gospel. From the view of life, the divine view, they were God's cultivated land to grow Christ. This was entirely a matter of life, a matter utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom. ",
  "4205":"As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether planters or waterers, are nothing; God is everything. We must turn our eyes from them to God alone. This delivers us from the divisiveness that results from appreciating one minister of Christ above another. ",
  "4206":"The reward is an incentive to the ministers of Christ who labor by planting or watering on God's cultivated land. ",
  "4207":"God too is a worker. While the ministers of Christ, His fellow workers, are working on His cultivated land, He too is working. What a privilege and glory that men can be God's fellow workers, working together with God on His cultivated land to grow Christ! ",
  "4208":"I.e., farm. The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life, are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ that precious materials may be produced for God's building. Hence, we are not only God's cultivated land but also God's building. Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us. Christ must grow in us and, in the sense of this chapter, produce out of us not fruit but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God's habitation on earth. Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness. ",
  "4209":"The Greek word means chief craftsman. In Matt. 16:18 the Lord said that He would build His church; yet here the apostle said that he was a builder, even a wise master builder. This indicates that the Lord builds the church not directly but through His ministers, even through every member of His Body, as revealed in Eph. 4:16. Although in vv. 5-7 the apostle admitted that he was nothing, here he frankly and faithfully made clear that by the grace of God he was a wise master builder who had laid the unique foundation, Christ, for others to build upon. ",
  "4210":"The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, precious materials produced from Christ's growing in us. Yet there is a great possibility that we may build with wood, grass, and stubble produced by us in the flesh. Hence, each of us, every member of the Body, must take heed how he builds, that is, with what material he builds. ",
  "4211":"As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay another foundation. ",
  "4212":"The foundation is unique, but the building may differ because different builders may use different materials. All the Corinthian believers had accepted Christ as the foundation. However, some Jewish believers among them attempted to build the church with their Judaistic attainments, and some Greek believers attempted to use their philosophical wisdom. They were not like the apostles, who built with their excellent knowledge and rich experiences of Christ. The intention of the apostle in this Epistle was to warn the believers not to build the church with the things of their natural background. They must learn to build with Christ, both in objective knowledge and in subjective experience, as Paul did. ",
  "4213":"Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. It is with these that the apostles and all spiritual believers build the church on the unique foundation of Christ. Gold may signify the divine nature of the Father with all its attributes, silver may signify the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work, and precious stones may signify the transforming work of the Spirit with all its attributes. All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Only these are good for God's building. <br><br>   As God's cultivated land with planting, watering, and growing, the church should produce plants; but the proper materials for the building of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals. Hence, the thought of transformation is implied here. We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life, as revealed in 2 Cor. 3:18 and Rom. 12:2. This corresponds with the thought in the Lord's parables in Matt. 13 concerning wheat, mustard seed, and meal (all of which are botanical) and the treasure hidden in the earth &#151; gold and precious stones (minerals). See notes 31 33 and 44 in Matt. 13. ",
  "4214":"Wood, grass, and stubble signify the knowledge, realization, and attainments that come from the believers' natural background (such as Judaism or other religions, philosophy, or culture) and the natural way of living (which is mainly in the soul and is the natural life). Wood, in contrast to gold, signifies the nature of the natural man; grass, in contrast to silver, signifies the fallen man, the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24), who has not been redeemed or regenerated by Christ; and stubble, in contrast to precious stones, signifies the work and living that issue from an earthen source and have not been transformed by the Holy Spirit. All these worthless materials are the product of the believers' natural man together with what they have collected from their background. In God's economy these materials are fit only to be burned (v. 13). ",
  "4215":"The day of Christ's second coming, when He will judge all His believers (4:5; Matt. 25:19-30; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12). ",
  "4216":"The fire of the Lord's judgment (Mal. 3:2; 4:1; 2 Thes. 1:7b-8; Heb. 6:8), which will cause each believer's work to be manifest and will try and test his work. All the work of wood, grass, and stubble will be unable to stand that test and will be burned. ",
  "4217":"The work that remains must be of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ. Such a work will be rewarded by the coming and judging Lord. ",
  "4218":"The reward is based on the believer's work after he is saved. It differs from salvation, which is based on faith in the Lord and His redemptive work. See note 35 in Heb. 10. ",
  "4219":"The work of wood, grass, and stubble, which is fit only to be burned. ",
  "4220":"Loss of reward, not of salvation. To suffer loss here does not mean to perish. ",
  "4221":"The salvation that we have received in Christ is not by our works (Titus 3:5) and is eternal, unchangeable in nature (Heb. 5:9; John 10:28-29). Hence, those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the judging Lord and who suffer the loss of reward will still be saved. God's salvation as a free gift to all believers is for eternity, whereas the Lord's reward to those (not all) believers whose Christian works are approved by Him is for the kingdom age. The reward is an incentive for their Christian work. See note 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "4222":"Although those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the Lord at His coming back will be saved, they will be saved so as through fire. Through fire surely indicates punishment. However, this is altogether not the purgatory heretically taught by Catholicism in its superstitious twisting of this verse. Nevertheless, this word should be a solemn warning to us today concerning our Christian works. ",
  "4223":"The Greek word denotes the inner temple. The temple of God here refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, such as Corinth, whereas the temple of God in v. 17 refers to all the believers universally. The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expression in many localities on earth. Each expression is the temple of God in that locality. <br><br>   The temple of God is the explanation of God's building in v. 9. God's building is not an ordinary building; it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells. We, the builders of such a holy temple, should realize this, that we may be careful to build not with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble but with the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones, which correspond with God's nature and economy. ",
  "4224":"Or, ruins, corrupts, defiles, mars. To destroy the temple of God is to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble, as described in v. 12. This refers to certain Jewish believers who attempted to build the church with elements of Judaism, and to certain Greek believers who endeavored to bring philosophical elements into the building. All this tended to corrupt, ruin, defile, and mar the temple of God, that is, to destroy it. Using any doctrine that differs from the fundamental teachings of the apostles (Acts 2:42) or any ways and efforts that contradict God's nature, Christ's redemptive work, and the Spirit's transforming work is to corrupt, ruin, defile, mar, and destroy the church of God. ",
  "4225":"This implies at least the punishment unveiled in v. 15. All those who have corrupted, ruined, defiled, and marred the church of God by their heretical doctrines, divisive teachings, worldly ways, and natural efforts in building will suffer God's punishment. ",
  "4226":"Since the temple of God, the church, is holy, the materials, the ways, and the efforts by which we build it also must be holy, corresponding with God's nature, Christ's redemption, and the Spirit's transformation. ",
  "4227":"Such refers to the holy temple. The emphasis here is on holy, not on temple. Verse 16 stresses the temple, whereas v. 17 emphasizes the holy characteristic of the temple, as a reminder to the common Corinthian believers that they should be holy, having the holy characteristic of the temple of God. ",
  "4228":"Both the Judaizing believers and the philosophizing Greek believers deceived themselves by bringing the elements of Judaism and Greek philosophy into the building up of the church. ",
  "4229":"The apostle's thought here centered mainly on those Greek believers who highly esteemed the wisdom of their philosophy (1:22). ",
  "4230":"To become foolish here is to forsake the wisdom of philosophy and receive the simple word concerning Christ and His cross (1:21, 23). ",
  "4231":"To become wise here is to take the wisdom of God in making Christ everything to us (1:24, 30; 2:6-8). ",
  "4232":"Meaning aimless. ",
  "4233":"All things, including the world and death, are ours and work for good to us (Rom. 8:28). The Corinthian believers said that they were of Paul or Apollos or Cephas (1:12), but Paul said that he, Apollos, and Cephas were of them; all were theirs. They were the church, and all these things are for the church. The church is for Christ, and Christ is for God. ",
  "4234":"Or, reckon, measure, and classify. ",
  "4235":"The way described in 3:21-23. ",
  "4236":"An attendant or appointed servant, an official servant appointed specifically for a certain purpose (Acts 26:16). ",
  "4237":"The Greek word is of the same root as the word for economy in 1 Tim. 1:4 and Eph. 1:10. It means a dispensing steward, a household administrator, who dispenses the household supply to its members. The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God's mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4), to the believers. This dispensing service, the stewardship, is the ministry of the apostles. ",
  "4238":"I.e., in the stewardship, the dispensing ministry. ",
  "4239":"Examined for judgment or in judgment. ",
  "4240":"Man's day of judgment is the present age, in which man judges (this judgment refers to man's examination). It is in contrast to the Lord's day (3:13), which is the coming age, the kingdom age, in which the Lord will judge and in which the judgment will be the Lord's judgment. ",
  "4241":"Or, condemn. ",
  "4242":"I.e., before the Lord's day (3:13). ",
  "4243":"Referring to the things mentioned in the preceding passage, from ch. 1 to this chapter. ",
  "4244":"A term used for metaphoric expressions. The things written by the apostle in the preceding chapters, chs. 1--3, were applicable to all those who served the Lord, especially to the proud and divisive Corinthians. But for their sake, that is, according to their condition and for their benefit, Paul transferred these things to himself and Apollos, using himself and Apollos as figures, as he had said in 3:5-8. By doing so, he expected the puffed up Corinthians to understand and apply to themselves the comparison that he made. ",
  "4245":"This must refer to what had been written in the preceding chapters, such as \"Was Paul crucified for you?\" (1:13) and \"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul?\" (3:5). They were simply ministers of Christ, a planter and a waterer (3:5-7). They were not Christ, who was crucified for the believers. They were not God, who causes the believers to grow. They should not be appraised beyond what they were. Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, might be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other. ",
  "4246":"It is God who distinguishes us from others. And what we have we received from God. Hence, all the glory should be ascribed to God, and we should boast in Him, not in ourselves or in any servants, such as Paul or Apollos, whom He has used. ",
  "4247":"The Corinthian believers, proud of what they had obtained, became satisfied with what they had. They became self-sufficient and reigned independently of the apostles. This was altogether in themselves and in their flesh. ",
  "4248":"In Paul's time, when criminals fought with wild beasts in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, they were exhibited last of all. Paul applied this figure to the apostles, who were set forth by God as last of all in His spectacle. ",
  "4249":"The apostles considered themselves criminals doomed to death before the world, unlike the Corinthians, who considered themselves kings destined to reign. ",
  "4250":"A metaphor, referring to the fights between criminals and wild beasts in the Roman amphitheater. The apostles became such a spectacle to the world, seen not only by men but also by angels. See note 33 in Heb. 10. ",
  "4251":"The apostles were willing to be foolish by forsaking their human wisdom for the sake of Christ. But the fleshly Corinthian believers remained prudent in their natural wisdom, while claiming that they were in Christ. ",
  "4252":"The apostles, while ministering Christ, appeared to be weak, for they used no strength or power of their natural being (2:3). But the fleshly Corinthian believers were strong, seeking to be recognized as prominent among the believers by exercising their natural ability. ",
  "4253":"The Corinthian believers were glorious, or honorable, in a display of splendor. But the apostles were dishonored and despised by the glory-seeking Corinthians. ",
  "4254":"Or, insulted, spoken to injuriously. ",
  "4255":"I.e., entreat with exhortation, consolation, and encouragement in order to appease. ",
  "4256":"Offscouring and scum are synonyms. Offscouring denotes that which is thrown away in cleansing; hence, refuse, filth. Scum denotes that which is wiped off; hence, rubbish, refuse. Both terms are used metaphorically, especially regarding condemned criminals of the lowest class, who were cast into the sea or to the wild beasts in the amphitheater. ",
  "4257":"Lit., child-conductors; as in Gal. 3:24-25. ",
  "4258":"Guides, child-conductors, give instructions and directions to the children who are under their guardianship; fathers impart life to their children whom they beget. The apostle was such a father; he had begotten the Corinthian believers in Christ through the gospel, imparting the divine life into them so that they became children of God and members of Christ. ",
  "4259":"See note 13. ",
  "4260":"These were the ways in which the apostle conducted himself as he taught the saints in every church. ",
  "4261":"This expression indicates two things: (1) that the apostle's teaching was the same universally, not varying from place to place; and (2) that everywhere equals every church, and every church, everywhere. ",
  "4262":"This refers to the church life, implying that in the sense of authority the church in this age is the kingdom of God. ",
  "4263":"This word was spoken to the Corinthian believers on the basis of the consideration that the apostle was their spiritual father. As such, he had the position and responsibility to chastise his children. ",
  "4264":"The apostle's regenerated spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. The spirit of meekness is one that is saturated with the meekness of Christ (2 Cor. 10:1) and, hence, expresses the virtue of Christ. ",
  "4265":"The first problem, dealt with in chs. 1--4, is the matter of division, which is related mainly to the natural life of the soul. The second problem, dealt with in ch. 5, the second section of the book, is the sin of fornication, which is related to the lust of the flesh. This problem, involving incest with one's stepmother, is morally more gross than the former. The former pertains to the strife that comes from pride; the latter is a gross sin that comes from lust. ",
  "4266":"Lit., father's wife. ",
  "4267":"See note 13. ",
  "4268":"The apostle, as a spiritual person, behaved in his spirit, in contrast to the Corinthians, who behaved either in the soul or in the flesh. Although he was absent from them in the body, he was still present with them in the spirit, exercising his spirit to judge the evil person among them. ",
  "4269":"Both in the name of our Lord Jesus and with the power of our Lord Jesus modify deliver in v. 5. The apostle, in his spirit, applied the mighty name of the Lord with His power to deliver the evil person to Satan. ",
  "4270":"The apostle's spirit was so strong that it attended the meeting of the Corinthian believers. His spirit was assembled with them to carry out his judgment upon the evil person. ",
  "4271":"To deliver a sinful person to Satan is for discipline. ",
  "4272":"This refers mainly to the affliction of a certain disease (2 Cor. 12:7; Luke 13:16). ",
  "4273":"Flesh here refers to the lustful body, which should be destroyed. ",
  "4274":"This sinful one among the Corinthian believers was a brother who had been saved once for eternity (John 10:28-29). He could never perish because of any sin. However, because of his sinfulness he needed to be disciplined by the destruction of his sinful flesh, that he might be kept in a condition in which his spirit could be saved in the day of the Lord. ",
  "4275":"See note 13 in ch. 3. ",
  "4276":"Or, glorying. In spite of the confusion and the presence of the gross sin of incest among them, the Corinthian believers were boasting and glorying. The apostle's Epistle should have humbled them by pointing out the sinful things among them, thus making them realize that their boasting was not good. ",
  "4277":"The apostle's thought here might have been that there was no need to have a sin as gross as that which existed among them; just a little leaven, a little sin, leavens and corrupts the whole lump, the whole church. ",
  "4278":"See note 33 in Matt. 13. ",
  "4279":"Lit., young, new in time. See note 10 in Col. 3. The new lump refers to the church, composed of the believers in their new nature. ",
  "4280":"This indicates that the apostle considered the believers God's chosen people, who have had their Passover, as typified by the one in Exo. 12. In this Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God. In this feast no leaven is allowed to be present. Sin and the redeeming Christ cannot go together. ",
  "4281":"The feast here refers to the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). It lasted for seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast, which we must keep not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet. The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life. ",
  "4282":"Or, mix, associate. So also in v. 11. ",
  "4283":"The evil persons mentioned in this verse are not those who have simply committed a certain sin, but those who live in that sin and remain in it, refusing to repent. To remove such a one is not just to remove a sin from the church but to judge and remove a sinful person so that the church will not be leavened by his presence. ",
  "4284":"I.e., cut him off from the fellowship of the church, as typified by the separating of a leper from the people of God (Lev. 13:45-46). ",
  "4285":"The third problem dealt with by this Epistle is the matter of one brother going to law against another (vv. 1-11). This is not a sin like division, initiated by the soul, nor a gross sin like incest, carried out by the lustful body. This is a case of one claiming his legal rights, being unwilling to suffer wrong, unwilling to learn the lesson of the cross. ",
  "4286":"The unbelievers, who are unrighteous, unjust, before God. ",
  "4287":"In the coming kingdom age the overcoming saints will rule over the nations of the world (Heb. 2:5-6; Rev. 2:26-27). ",
  "4288":"Judgments carried out by a number of saints who judge cases among themselves. The judging of such cases is trifling compared to the ruling of the world. ",
  "4289":"Lit., tribunals. ",
  "4290":"Things of this life indicates that judgment over the angels by the saints will be in the future, not in this age. This probably refers to the judgment over the angels that is revealed in 2 Pet. 2:4 and Jude 6. The angels mentioned in these verses and those referred to in Eph. 2:2; 6:12; and Matt. 25:41 must be the evil angels. Thus, in the future we, the believers of Christ, will judge not only the human world but also the angelic world. ",
  "4291":"The unbelievers, who are of no account in the church. ",
  "4292":"The Greek word for goes to court is the same as the word for to be judged in v. 1. ",
  "4293":"Implying a defect, fault, loss, falling short (in the inheriting of the kingdom of God &#151; v. 9). ",
  "4294":"The Greek word has the same root as the word for goes to court in the preceding verse. ",
  "4295":"Willingness to be wronged or defrauded is willingness to suffer loss, to learn the lesson of the cross, to keep the virtue of Christ at some cost. ",
  "4296":"To inherit the kingdom in the next age is a reward to the saints who seek righteousness (Matt. 5:10, 20; 6:33). See notes 10 in Matt. 5, 21 in Gal. 5, 5 in Eph. 5, and 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "4297":"In contrast to the washing, sanctifying, and justifying in 1 John 1:7, Heb. 10:29, and Rom. 3:24-25, the washing, sanctifying, and justifying here are not by the blood in an objective way. They are the subjective washing of regeneration as in Titus 3:5, the subjective sanctifying by the Spirit as in Rom. 15:16, and the subjective justifying in the Spirit as in this verse. All these items of God's salvation were accomplished in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (i.e., in the person of the Lord, in an organic union with the Lord through faith) and in the Spirit of God (i.e., in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit). First, we were washed from the sinful things; second, we were sanctified, separated unto God, transformed by God; and third, we were justified, accepted, by God. ",
  "4298":"The fourth matter dealt with by this Epistle is the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body (vv. 12-20). Foods for man to exist and sex (pertaining to the body) for man to propagate are both necessary and ordained by God. Man has the right to use them. However, he should not abuse them, nor should he be under their power, controlled and enslaved by them. Abusive eating, such as the eating of things sacrificed to idols, stumbles the weak brothers (8:9-13; 10:28-30, 32), and excessive eating damages our body. Both foods and our stomach will be done away with; God will bring both to nothing. The abuse of sex is fornication. Not only is it condemned by God; it also destroys our body (v. 18), which is for the Lord. ",
  "4299":"Lit., under my authority (of choice to do); hence, permissible, allowable, lawful. ",
  "4300":"Advantageous (not merely convenient), good, worthwhile. ",
  "4301":"Lit., brought under the authority. This means that all things were under Paul's authority, but he would not be brought under the authority of anything, and that all things were permissible, allowable, lawful to him, but he would not be ruled (enslaved) or brought under the authority, the control, of any. Verse 12 may be considered a proverb that governed the apostle's dealings with some problems mentioned in the following section, 6:13--11:1. ",
  "4302":"Foods and the stomach are for the existence of the body. By themselves they do not mean anything; God will bring them to nothing. ",
  "4303":"Our body was created for the Lord, and the Lord within us is for our body. He feeds it with material food (Psa. 103:5) and gives it His resurrection life (Rom. 8:11), which swallows its death element along with its weakness and sickness. Eventually, He will transfigure it, conforming it to His glorious body. We should not abuse it by committing fornication. ",
  "4304":"God raised up the Lord bodily. Our body is destined to participate in the Lord's glorious body in resurrection (Phil. 3:21) and to be raised incorruptible (15:52). This will be the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Even now the Spirit of the resurrected Christ, who dwells in us, gives life to our body (Rom. 8:11), making it a member of Christ (v. 15) and a temple of God indwelt by His Holy Spirit (v. 19). ",
  "4305":"Because we are organically united with Christ (v. 17), and because Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and makes His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17), our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him. Hence, to practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him (Rom. 12:1, 4-5). ",
  "4306":"Lit., May it not happen! ",
  "4307":"This refers to the believers' organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit. ",
  "4308":"This indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (v. 19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). This is the realization of the Lord, who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) and who is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul's Epistles, e.g., in Rom. 8:4-6. ",
  "4309":"Lit., result of sinning; the same word as for sins in Mark 3:28 and Rom. 3:25. ",
  "4310":"The Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and our spirit is within our body. Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "4311":"The precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 5:9). ",
  "4312":"This is to allow God, who dwells in us (1 John 4:13), to occupy and saturate our body and express Himself through our body as His temple, especially in the two matters of eating and marriage, according to the context of this section, 6:13--11:1. For this we need to exercise a severe and strict control over our body, bringing it into subjection (9:27) and presenting it to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). ",
  "4313":"The fifth problem in this Epistle &#151; the matter of marriage &#151; is dealt with here. It is treated according to the principles established in the preceding section (6:12-20). ",
  "4314":"Lit., fornications. ",
  "4315":"Lit., have leisure for, be free for; hence, give oneself to. Prayer requires us to be free from persons, matters, and things. The prayer that requires staying away from the spouse for a time must be special and of great importance. ",
  "4316":"The tempter, Satan, is crouching to capture the believers. ",
  "4317":"The same Greek word is translated self-indulgence in Matt. 23:25. ",
  "4318":"This implies that the apostle in his teaching had authority to give commands to the believers. ",
  "4319":"Since the apostle Paul was absolute for the Lord and His economy, he wished that all men would be like him. He desired that they not marry but remain as he was (v. 8) so that they also might be absolute for the Lord's interests without any distraction (vv. 33-34a). In this wish he expressed the Lord's aspiration concerning His called ones. ",
  "4320":"For a believer in Christ to be able not to marry is a gift from God (Matt. 19:10-12). For those who have not received such a gift, it is better to marry (v. 9). ",
  "4321":"This was the apostle's wish and opinion in his earlier ministry (vv. 7, 25, 40). Later, after witnessing the actual outcome, he charged young widows to marry (1 Tim. 5:11-15 and note 14). ",
  "4322":"Or, continency. The same Greek word is used in 9:25 regarding athletes' abstaining from sensual indulgences during preparation for the games. ",
  "4323":"The Old Testament principle of speaking for God (prophesying) is, \"Thus saith the Lord\" (Isa. 10:24; 50:1; Jer. 2:2; Ezek. 2:4). But the New Testament principle of incarnation is, \"I [the speaker] charge.\" The speaker and the Lord are one. Hence, Paul also said, \"Not I but the Lord.\" The Greek word for charge may be translated enjoin or command. ",
  "4324":"This indicates two things: (1) that the apostle was one with the Lord; hence, what he commanded, the Lord commanded; and (2) that his commands were the Lord's. The Lord had commanded in Matt. 5:31-32 and 19:3-9 what the apostle commanded here. Divorce is altogether not allowed by the Lord. ",
  "4325":"Whether separated or divorced, one should not remarry but should expect reconciliation and wait for it. ",
  "4326":"Again, this is based on the New Testament principle of incarnation. Although he followed to say, \"I, not the Lord,\" whatever the apostle said in the succeeding verses is part of the divine revelation of the New Testament. It was his opinion in the Lord, not the Lord's commandment, yet it still expressed the Lord's mind. ",
  "4327":"To be sanctified is to be made holy, separated unto God for His purpose. As the believing wife is of the Lord and for the Lord, so her unbelieving husband is made holy, sanctified, separated unto God, because he is for his wife, who is of and for God. It is similar to the situation in which the temple and the altar make the common things holy when the latter are attached to them (Matt. 23:17, 19). The same principle applies to the unbelieving wife and the children. For the unbeliever to be sanctified in this way does not mean that he is saved, just as the sanctification of food through the saints' prayer has nothing to do with salvation (1 Tim. 4:5). A saved person is a sanctified person, a saint. Anyone who is attached to him and is for him is made holy because of him. ",
  "4328":"Not under bondage but freed from his or her marriage to an unbeliever, when the unbeliever leaves the believer. ",
  "4329":"God in His salvation has called us to Him in the sphere and element of peace. Hence, we should live in this peace. If the unbelieving party in our marriage desires to leave, we should allow it. But that we may live in the peace in which God has called us, God does not want us to initiate any separation as long as the other party consents to remain (v. 13). The succeeding verses (through v. 24) are based on this: that God has called us in peace. ",
  "4330":"For indicates that vv. 16-24 are an explanation of the preceding word, that is, that God has called us in peace. To remain in this peace we must keep the word in vv. 16-24. ",
  "4331":"Since we do not know whether we will save our unbelieving husband or wife, we should not insist that he or she remain with us or that he or she leave. God wants us to remain in the status in which He called us (vv. 20, 24), not to initiate any change. Therefore, we should leave the entire matter to the unbelieving party. ",
  "4332":"This word strongly charges us to remain in the status of marriage in which God called us (vv. 20, 24). ",
  "4333":"This is to efface the mark of circumcision so that the body may be restored to its original condition. ",
  "4334":"Both circumcision and uncircumcision are outward matters and do not count in reality; only the keeping of God's commandments is what counts (Gal. 5:6; 6:15; Rom. 2:25-29). ",
  "4335":"Or, do not care for it, let it not trouble you. Since the believers have the Lord as the sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9), they should not be troubled by anything. ",
  "4336":"But here conjoins Let it not concern you and use your status as a slave rather. It means that a slave who has been called by the Lord should not care for or be troubled by his slavery, but rather should use this status, that is, remain in this status with God (v. 24) for God's glory. Even if he is able to become free, he should remain in his status as a slave. This corresponds with the basic concept of the apostle's instruction, as explicitly expressed in vv. 20 and 24. However, this part of the verse may be rendered as follows: \" ... but, even if you are able to become free, take advantage of it rather.\" The apostle's point in this passage is that the believers should not be influenced by their outward status. Either to remain in slavery or to have freedom is all right, as long as it is with God. ",
  "4337":"The Lord's calling does not change the outward status of His believers, but it does change their inward reality: one who is a slave outwardly is changed to a freedman inwardly, and one who is a free man outwardly is changed to a slave inwardly. ",
  "4338":"See note 20 in ch. 6. ",
  "4339":"Believers inwardly should be slaves only of Christ; they should not become slaves of men. ",
  "4340":"After being called, the believers do not need to change their outward status, but they do need to have a change in their inward condition, that is, from being without God to being with God, in order to be one with God and have God with them in their status, whatever it may be. ",
  "4341":"A wife should not be separated from her husband. This, the apostle said, is the Lord's commandment (v. 10). Concerning virgins' not marrying, he said that he had no commandment of the Lord, but he gave his opinion in the succeeding verses. He dared to do this because he had been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful to the Lord's interests, and he was truly one with the Lord. His opinion expressed the Lord's desire. This again is based on the New Testament principle of incarnation. ",
  "4342":"The Greek word for present may mean also that the presence of a certain thing foreshadows and inaugurates something to come. Here the present necessity, or distress, indicates that more anguish is to come, as prophesied by the Lord in Matt. 24:8, 19, 21. ",
  "4343":"Or, pressure, constraint; hence, distress, anguish. The word refers to the necessities of life in the present age, the demand of which constrains and presses people and becomes a distress and anguish to them. See note 10 in 2 Cor. 12. ",
  "4344":"The concept that at Paul's time the time was shortened was due to the fact that the long period between the latter part of the first century and Christ's second coming was not revealed to the earlier apostles (Matt. 24:36). They expected the Lord to return in their generation. ",
  "4345":"Lit., divided. A man who would please his wife is distracted, divided, from the things of the Lord (v. 35). ",
  "4346":"I.e., entangle you with a snare, constrain you to obey my word. ",
  "4347":"Lit., not having necessity. ",
  "4348":"Or, judged. ",
  "4349":"See note 8. ",
  "4350":"In v. 10 the apostle said, \"I charge, not I but the Lord.\" In v. 12 he said, \"I say, I, not the Lord.\" In v. 25 he said, \"I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.\" Here he says, \" ... according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.\" All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation (that is, that God and man, man and God, become one). This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy (that is, that man speaks for God). In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus, the two speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle's charge was the Lord's charge (v. 10). What he said, though it was not spoken by the Lord, still became part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (v. 12). He was one with the Lord to such a degree that even when he gave his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (v. 25), he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. He did not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality; it is based on the principle of incarnation. ",
  "4351":"The sixth problem dealt with by this Epistle is the matter of eating things sacrificed to idols (8:1--11:1). ",
  "4352":"Referring to the inward, subjective consciousness. ",
  "4353":"Knowledge in this verse and in vv. 7, 10 refers to the outward, objective knowledge, which is common and general. ",
  "4354":"The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the source of death. Spiritual (not fleshly) love, which is an expression of life as described in ch. 13, builds up. It comes from the tree of life, the source of life. This is the love of God (1 John 4:16) infused into us by faith, which has brought us into the organic union with God. By this love we love God (v. 3) and the brothers (1 John 4:21), and according to this love we should walk (Rom. 14:15). Thus, our walk builds up (10:23). ",
  "4355":"Referring not only to the edification of individual believers but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ (14:4-5, 12; Eph. 4:16). This book stresses the matter of building up (3:9-10, 12; 10:23). ",
  "4356":"Referring to the outward, objective knowledge. So for known in v. 3. ",
  "4357":"The highest and noblest love. It must be spiritual, not fleshly, although it requires the exercise of man's entire being (Mark 12:30). ",
  "4358":"Referring to the inward, subjective consciousness. To realize that an idol is nothing and that there is no God but one requires our inward, subjective consciousness derived from our spirit through our mind. This consciousness is much deeper than the outward, objective knowledge, which is merely in our mind. ",
  "4359":"The believers in Christ, the Christians. ",
  "4360":"In contrast to many gods in v. 5. Our God is uniquely one. ",
  "4361":"A designation of our God, who is the source of all things. This designation makes our God utterly distinct from the many false gods. ",
  "4362":"The Father is the source of all things; thus, all things are out from Him. However, only we as believers will turn to Him; hence, we are unto Him. Similarly, all things that the Father created came into being through Jesus Christ as the means, and it is through the means of the Lord's regeneration that we as believers turn to the Father and are unto Him. Hence, both we and all things are through Christ. ",
  "4363":"In contrast to many lords in v. 5. Our Lord also is uniquely one. ",
  "4364":"The divine and human title of our Lord that distinguishes Him from the many lords. Our God, the Father, is the unique source of all things, and our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the unique means through whom all things came into being. ",
  "4365":"A weak conscience is due to the lack of proper and adequate knowledge. This indicates that our knowledge has much to do with our conscience. The ex-idol worshippers who are now believers in Christ, being accustomed to the idol until now, lack the knowledge that an idol is nothing (v. 4). Thus, their conscience is weak concerning the matter of idols. ",
  "4366":"The weak conscience is defiled when it is touched by any matter about which it lacks adequate knowledge. ",
  "4367":"The Greek word means to abound so that one becomes full and excelling; hence, become full and excelling. Here it denotes that eating things sacrificed to idols cannot cause us to become full and excelling in any respect before God; therefore, neither can not eating cause us to be lacking, which is in contrast to being full and excelling. ",
  "4368":"Or, liberty. Lit., authority. So also in 9:4-5. ",
  "4369":"Those whose conscience is weakened by a lack of knowledge. ",
  "4370":"Lit., built up. The conscience of the weak believers will be built up with boldness to do what it formerly dared not do. This is a sudden building up without a logical and solid foundation. Hence, it is an improper building up that actually ruins. Although the conscience of the weak believers is emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols, such a practice will eventually ruin them because they do not have adequate knowledge to support their emboldened yet still weak conscience. ",
  "4371":"This denotes perishing, not perishing for eternity but perishing in the Christian life. The weak believer is destroyed by the carelessness of the stronger one who has knowledge. ",
  "4372":"Lit., smiting (unto damage). ",
  "4373":"The Greek word means to snare, to entrap. Cf. note 32 in ch. 10. ",
  "4374":"I.e., animal flesh, referring to the meat offered to idols. Since meat is more tempting than other kinds of food, the apostle mentioned it specifically. ",
  "4375":"This chapter is an insertion in this section on eating idol sacrifices. In this insertion the apostle presented himself to the Corinthian believers as a pattern, that they might not stumble others but build them up by practicing the principle of considerate love set forth in 8:13. ",
  "4376":"The apostle Paul was free from all men, being enslaved to no one (v. 19). As all believers in Christ should be, he was free also from the bondage of any particular way of eating, although he practiced the principle of considerate love. ",
  "4377":"As he presented himself a pattern to the believers, the apostle came to the matter of his apostleship, which gave him authority to deal with all the problems covered in this book, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship. His handling of these problems was based not only on his teaching but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship. To deal with the situation, he had to take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers. They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mainly because of the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride. <br><br>   The Greek word for apostle means one who is sent. An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. In the first section of Acts, Peter and John were such apostles among the Jews, and in the second section of Acts, Paul and Barnabas were such apostles among the Gentiles. After them, others also became apostles, such as Silas (i.e., Silvanus) and Timothy (1 Thes. 1:1; 2:6). As long as one has the power to preach the gospel, the gift to teach the divine truth, and the ability to establish churches, he is qualified and confirmed to be an apostle sent by the Lord with His commission and authority. ",
  "4378":"This refers to Paul's having seen the Lord in His glorious resurrected body (15:5-8). This is a special privilege; it constitutes some dignity and glory to the seer, but it is not a requirement or qualification for being the Lord's apostle. This is fully proven by the case of Barnabas, who was one of the apostles (Acts 14:14) yet did not see the Lord in this way. However, to know the Lord in spirit by spiritual revelation is definitely needed for one to be an apostle. ",
  "4379":"The fruitful result of his work in the Lord was a proof of, not a qualification for, Paul's apostleship. ",
  "4380":"Because he had begotten them in the Lord through the gospel (4:15). The fruit of his labor was the evidence of his apostleship. ",
  "4381":"The sufficient result of the apostle's effective work was not only an evidence, a proof, but also a seal of his apostleship. It put a distinctive mark on his apostolic labor that authenticated and certified his apostleship. ",
  "4382":"Referring to the defense in vv. 1-2. ",
  "4383":"The apostle's bold, frank, strong, and direct defense in vv. 4-15 reveals that he was a person with a pure heart and spirit, and that in the Lord's work he had no intention other than Christ and His Body. ",
  "4384":"Or, liberty. ",
  "4385":"To eat and drink for the gospel (v. 14) at the expense of the saints and the churches. ",
  "4386":"Or, that is treading out the grain. ",
  "4387":"Or, endure. Lit., contain (as a vessel), conceal; hence, cover (as a roof ). ",
  "4388":"The word for sacred here is different from the word for holy in Rom. 1:2 and the word for holiness in Luke 1:75, and is the same as the word for sacred in 2 Tim. 3:15. It denotes the sacredness of the things that are related to the worship of God. ",
  "4389":"The apostle was desperately absolute for the Lord's interests. He was willing not only to sacrifice all his rights (vv. 12, 15a, 18) but also to pay the price even of his life. ",
  "4390":"Than what? Paul did not finish the sentence. Perhaps he was referring to the things mentioned in the first half of this verse. ",
  "4391":"This book was written not to help lost sinners to be saved but to help saved believers to grow (3:6-7), to build with the precious materials (3:10, 12-14), to care for the Lord's members (8:9-13), and to run the race (v. 24). Hence, a reward is mentioned repeatedly as an incentive to the believers for their progress (3:14; 9:18, 24-25). See note 35 in Heb. 10. ",
  "4392":"Or, household administration, household dispensation. The apostle was not only a preacher but also a steward in God's house, a household administrator, dispensing Christ's salvation, life, and riches to His believers. Such a ministry was the stewardship with which he had been entrusted and commissioned (Eph. 3:2; 2 Cor. 4:1). ",
  "4393":"I.e., all men. ",
  "4394":"I.e., outside the sphere, the limit, of law; hence, without law. ",
  "4395":"I.e., within the sphere, the limit, of law; hence, subject to law. Paul took Christ as his life and lived by Christ. This Christ, who lived in him as life and who has the law of life and is the very law of life (Rom. 8:2), ruled and regulated him that he might be legitimately, legally, rightfully, and duly subject to Christ. Therefore, Paul was within a higher and better law, being subject to the law of life. Hence, he was not outside law and was not without law to God. ",
  "4396":"This means that the apostle adapted himself to all things, that is, to different ways of eating and practice (v. 23), for the sake of all men. ",
  "4397":"Or, joint participant, cooperator, copartner. The apostle was not only a fellow partaker, a joint participant, enjoying the gospel but also a cooperator, a copartner, laboring for the gospel. However, here he referred to the enjoyment of the gospel. Hence, this word is rendered fellow partaker in the text. ",
  "4398":"This reveals that the Christian life is a race that we must run successfully. ",
  "4399":"I.e., a reward as an incentive. See note 17. ",
  "4400":"I.e., obtain. ",
  "4401":"A chaplet made of leaves for the athletic contests at that time. The incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation (see note 35 in Heb. 10). We, His believers, have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This has been settled once for all. But whether we will be rewarded by Him depends on how we run the race. Here, in this chapter, the apostle was running the course (v. 26). In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (Phil. 3:14). It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Tim. 4:6-8, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. In view of this prize the apostle charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they might obtain the reward (v. 24). ",
  "4402":"The Greek word means to beat the face under the eye black and blue. This is not to ill-treat the body, as in asceticism, nor to consider the body evil, as in Gnosticism. This is to subdue the body and make it a conquered captive to serve us as a slave for fulfilling our holy purpose. This is equivalent to putting to death our earthly members (Col. 3:5) and putting to death the practices of the body (Rom. 8:13), not allowing our body to be used for the indulgence of lust or doing anything on our own except what is holy to God. The Corinthians misused their body by indulgence in fornication, not caring for God's temple (6:19), and in the unrestrained eating of things sacrificed to idols, not caring for weak believers (8:9-13). ",
  "4403":"A metaphor meaning to lead the vanquished as a captive and a slave, to bring the captive into slavery, making him a slave to serve the conqueror's purpose. ",
  "4404":"The Greek word implies possibility. ",
  "4405":"According to the context of vv. 24-27, this refers to the preaching of the reward as an incentive to the Christian runners. This is related to the kingdom, the manifestation of which will be a reward to the overcoming saints who have won the Christian race. See note 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "4406":"Or, disqualified, rejected; i.e., unworthy of the prize. The apostle was surely saved by grace through faith in Christ. Not only so, he was called to be an apostle to carry out God's New Testament economy. Nonetheless, here he was very much on the alert to run his course (Acts 20:24) by subduing his body to serve his holy purpose, that he might not be disapproved and rejected at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and be found unworthy of the reward of the coming kingdom. See Matt. 7:21-23; 25:11-12. ",
  "4407":"For indicates that ch. 10 is not only a continuation of ch. 9 but also a further definition of running the race covered in 9:24-27, using as an illustration the children of Israel running on the racecourse in the wilderness to enter into the promised land. ",
  "4408":"This refers to the word Do you not know in 9:24. ",
  "4409":"This indicates that all the children of Israel who had enjoyed the Passover entered into the race and began to run the race from the time they left the land of Rameses (Exo. 12:37). ",
  "4410":"The cloud that covered the children of Israel typifies the Spirit of God, who is with the New Testament believers. Immediately after the New Testament believers take Christ as their Passover (5:7), the Spirit of God comes to be with them and lead them to run the Christian race, just as the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel (Exo. 13:21-22; 14:19-20). ",
  "4411":"The passing of the children of Israel through the Red Sea (Exo. 14:21-30) typifies the baptism of the New Testament believers (Rom. 6:4). ",
  "4412":"The children of Israel were baptized unto Moses to begin the holy race for the fulfilling of God's purpose, that is, to enter into the good land and build the temple, that God might have a kingdom with an expression of Himself on the earth. This typifies the baptizing of the New Testament believers into Christ (Gal. 3:27) that God may have His kingdom with the church as His expression on the earth. ",
  "4413":"In the cloud signifies in the Spirit, and in the sea denotes in the water. The New Testament believers were baptized in the water and in the Spirit (Matt. 3:11; Acts 1:5; 1 Cor. 12:13). ",
  "4414":"Referring to manna (Exo. 16:14-18), typifying Christ as our daily life supply (John 6:31-35) for the Christian journey. We believers should all eat the same spiritual food and should not eat anything other than Christ. ",
  "4415":"Referring to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6), typifying the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ, as our all-inclusive drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). For our running of the race we should all drink the same spiritual drink and should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit. ",
  "4416":"The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God's chosen people (Exo. 17:6) was a physical rock. Yet the apostle called it a spiritual rock because it typified Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life (John 19:34) to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ. Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers. ",
  "4417":"I.e., laid low on the ground by being slain. This refers to Num. 14:16, 29. ",
  "4418":"Lit., types (so also in v. 11); i.e., figures of facts or of spiritual truths. This book takes the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers. In 5:7-8 the believers experienced Christ as their Passover and began to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Here in this chapter they are baptized unto their Moses (Christ), passing through their Red Sea (the death of Christ). They are now eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink that they might take their journey (the Christian race) toward their good land (the all-inclusive Christ). Also, they are warned here (v. 11) not to repeat the history of the children of Israel in doing evil against God, as illustrated in vv. 6-11. <br><br>   The goal of God's calling of the children of Israel was that they would enter into the promised land to enjoy its riches so that they might establish God's kingdom and be God's expression on earth. However, although all Israel was redeemed through the Passover, delivered out of the Egyptian tyranny, and brought to the mountain of God to receive the revelation of God's dwelling place, the tabernacle, nearly all fell and died in the wilderness, failing to reach this goal (Heb. 3:7-19) because of their evildoings and unbelief. Only Caleb and Joshua reached the goal and entered into the good land (Num. 14:27-30). This signifies that although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan's bondage, and brought into the revelation of God's economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God's calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ (Phil. 3:12-14), and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age (Matt. 25:21, 23). This should be a solemn warning to all New Testament believers. It was especially applicable to the Corinthians, who were in danger of repeating the failure of the children of Israel in the wilderness. ",
  "4419":"The apostle included himself with all believers in the matter of running the Christian race. ",
  "4420":"The abusive eating by the children of Israel was related to their idolatry in worshipping the golden calf (Exo. 32:1-6). The apostle's word here implies that the Corinthians' inconsiderate eating of idol sacrifices was also somewhat related to idolatry. ",
  "4421":"Fornication accompanies idolatry (Num. 25:1-2). Hence, these two things are referred to together, as also in Acts 15:20, 29. Undoubtedly, the implication here is that these two evils existed among the Corinthian believers. Hence, these are the main things dealt with in chs. 5--10. ",
  "4422":"This is to be laid low on the ground by being slain. ",
  "4423":"Lit., try to the utmost, tempt thoroughly. Tested, later in this verse, does not carry the meaning of to the utmost and thoroughly. ",
  "4424":"The murmuring of the children of Israel (Num. 16:41) typified the negative speaking of the Corinthian believers against the apostle (4:3; 9:3). ",
  "4425":"God's executing angel (Exo. 12:23; 2 Sam. 24:16-17). ",
  "4426":"Lit., were happening. ",
  "4427":"The ages refers to all the past ages. The ends of the ages refers to the fact that all the past ages were consummated at the beginning of the New Testament age; hence, the ends of the ages had come to the people of that time. Those people could, in the New Testament age, take the admonition from the history of the children of Israel. After the New Testament age is the kingdom age, during which these examples in the Old Testament age will no longer serve for the running of the Christian race. ",
  "4428":"Lit., have come down, have arrived. ",
  "4429":"Based on the admonition in vv. 5-11, the apostle warned the Corinthians not to think that they were standing steadfast, with no danger of falling dead as the children of Israel had. ",
  "4430":"As the failing children of Israel fell and died in the wilderness (vv. 5, 8). Some Corinthian believers did fall and die because they offended the Lord's Body (11:27-30). ",
  "4431":"This verse is a continuation of the warning given in v. 12, indicating, on the one hand, that we should take heed not to be tempted lest we fall and die, and, on the other hand, that God in His faithfulness will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to endure, but will, with the temptation, always make the way out for us. ",
  "4432":"Or, trial (2 Pet. 2:9; cf. Dan. 3:17-18). ",
  "4433":"Lit., that which is human. ",
  "4434":"Or, tried. ",
  "4435":"This indicates that the following section, to v. 30, is a conclusion to the preceding section, from 8:1, concerning eating things sacrificed to idols. ",
  "4436":"Referring to the idolatry involved in eating things sacrificed to idols. ",
  "4437":"Or, joint participation in. Fellowship here refers to the believers' communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ. This makes us, the participants in the Lord's blood and body, not only one with one another but also one with the Lord. We, the participants, make ourselves identified with the Lord in the fellowship of His blood and body. The apostle's thought here was to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink. The Corinthians should have realized that their abusive eating of idol sacrifices actually made them one with the demons behind the sacrifices. ",
  "4438":"The one bread signifies the one Body of Christ. We all are one Body because we all partake of the one bread. Our joint partaking of the one bread makes us all one. This indicates that our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body. The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us His one Body. ",
  "4439":"Partaking of (that is, eating &#151; vv. 28-30) the one bread identifies us with it. This indicates that our partaking of Christ, our enjoying of Christ, identifies us with Him, making us one with Him. ",
  "4440":"Or, participate jointly in. Those who eat the sacrifices of the altar not only have fellowship with one another and with the altar but also participate jointly in what they eat. Their participation in what they eat makes them one with the sacrifices of the altar. This too illustrates how eating makes the eater one with what he eats. Eating things sacrificed to idols does the same: it identifies the eaters with the demons behind the sacrifices. ",
  "4441":"Since the altar is the base of the sacrifices offered to God, eating the sacrifices of the altar makes the eaters those who have fellowship with, those who participate jointly in, the altar. ",
  "4442":"An idol and the things sacrificed to an idol are nothing (v. 19; 8:4). But behind them are the demons, who are abominable and hateful to God. The believers, who worship God, should abstain from identifying themselves with demons and becoming those who have fellowship with demons through the eating of things sacrificed to idols. Since demons are the reality of idols, the eating of things sacrificed to idols makes the eaters those who have fellowship with, those who participate jointly in, demons. ",
  "4443":"See note 18. The eaters of things sacrificed to idols become not only those who fellowship with demons but also those who participate jointly in demons, making themselves one with demons. ",
  "4444":"To drink the Lord's cup and partake of the Lord's table is to identify ourselves with the Lord. To drink the demons' cup and partake of the demons' table is to make ourselves one with demons. ",
  "4445":"The Lord is the jealous God (Exo. 20:5). Idolatry is utterly abominable and hateful to Him. If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we will provoke the Lord to jealousy. Hence, we must flee from idolatry (v. 14). ",
  "4446":"Verses 14-22 deal with the eating of idol sacrifices from the aspect of making oneself one with demons. From v. 23 through 11:1 this matter is dealt with from the view of building up others to the glory of God (v. 31). ",
  "4447":"See note 12 in ch. 6. ",
  "4448":"See note 12 in ch. 6. ",
  "4449":"The parallel verse, 6:12, ends with I will not be brought under the power of anything. This verse ends with not all things build up. The former concerns ourselves; the latter, others. ",
  "4450":"At the apostles' time, usually only a part of what had been sacrificed to idols was consumed. The rest was given to the priests or to the poor, or was sold again in the market. Buyers might unknowingly purchase meat offered to idols. ",
  "4451":"I.e., eat. This indicates that eating is partaking (v. 17). ",
  "4452":"This indicates that 10:31--11:1 is a conclusion to this subsection (from v. 23). ",
  "4453":"Verses 23, 31, and 6:12 give us four basic principles for regulating the New Testament believers' conduct. All things are lawful, but whatever we do, (1) as to the thing itself, must be profitable, (2) as to ourselves, must not bring us under the power of anything, (3) as to others, must build them up, and (4) as to God, must glorify Him. Otherwise, nothing is permissible. ",
  "4454":"The Greek expression rendered do not become a stumbling block is based on the same root as the word for stumbling block in 8:9; it is different from the word for stumble in 8:13. ",
  "4455":"In New Testament times people are of three categories: (1) the Jews &#151; God's chosen people; (2) the Greeks &#151; the unbelieving Gentiles; and (3) the church &#151; a composition of the believers in Christ. We should not be an offense, a stumbling block, to anyone in these three categories, that they might be saved (v. 33). ",
  "4456":"What an example the apostle has set for us! ",
  "4457":"This verse is the last sentence of the conclusion of ch. 10. ",
  "4458":"If one is an imitator of Christ, we should be imitators of him. This makes us also imitators of Christ. Otherwise, we should be imitators of no man. ",
  "4459":"Instructions handed down by word of mouth or writing (2 Thes. 2:15). ",
  "4460":"Verses 3-16 deal with the seventh problem, the problem concerning head covering. The first six problems, dealt with in chs. 1--10, may be considered one group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of human life. The last five problems, dealt with in chs. 11--16, constitute another group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of God's administration. The first problem in this latter group concerns the headship of Christ and of God in the divine government. In Eph. 1:22-23 the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. Here the headship of Christ over every man is related to individuals. Christ is the Head of the Body, the church (Eph. 5:23), corporately, and of the believers individually. He is the Head of every one of us directly. In the apostle's dealing with the Corinthians' problems related to God's administration, the headship of Christ and of God was his first concern. ",
  "4461":"In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way (Gen. 2:18-24; 1 Tim. 2:13). According to the nature (v. 14) created by God, woman is subordinate to man. ",
  "4462":"Christ is God's anointed One, the One appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government. <br><br>   In dealing with the problem of head covering, the apostle took the headship of God, the headship of Christ, and the headship of man as strong ground for his instruction. His instruction concerning head covering was based not on any religious practice or human custom but on the headship in God's governmental administration. Such a strong base leaves no ground for argument over the matter of head covering. ",
  "4463":"I.e., speaking for God. See note 10 in ch. 12. ",
  "4464":"Since man has the headship over woman and is God's image and glory (v. 7), he should keep his head manifested, unconcealed, uncovered, when he touches the throne of God's administration by praying to God or speaking for Him. Otherwise, he dishonors or shames his head. ",
  "4465":"Since woman is under the headship of man, she should keep her head covered, not exposed, when she touches the divine administration by praying to God or speaking for God. Otherwise, she disgraces or shames her head, as if her head were shaved, because she denies the divine governmental ordination by exposing her head to the observing angels (v. 10) while touching the authority of God. ",
  "4466":"This is a strong indication that for a woman to have her head shaved or her hair cut off is shameful (v. 6). ",
  "4467":"This indicates that the head covering is a covering in addition to long hair. For a woman to keep her hair long, not having her head shaved, means that she does not reject God's governmental ordination; and for a woman to have a head covering in addition to her long hair indicates that she says amen to the divine ordination. ",
  "4468":"Man was made in God's image (Gen. 1:26) to express God and glorify Him. Since man bears God's image and glory and represents God, he should not have his head covered. If he does, God's image and glory will be concealed. ",
  "4469":"Since the woman is the glory of the man, she should not have her head exposed but should have it covered. She should not express herself but the man, under whom she is. The apostle took this too as ground for his teaching concerning head covering. ",
  "4470":"As a rib taken out of man, woman was made out of man (Gen. 2:21-23). ",
  "4471":"Here the apostle took God's purpose in the creation of man and woman as further strong ground for his teaching concerning head covering. That teaching is not based on any man-made custom but on the divine purpose in creation. ",
  "4472":"Woman was made for the purpose of matching man (Gen. 2:18, 24). ",
  "4473":"I.e., the head covering, which signifies man's headship over the woman. ",
  "4474":"This was further ground for the teaching concerning head covering. Head covering is closely related to God's headship, God's authority. The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against God's headship (Ezek. 28:13-18; Isa. 14:12-15; Matt. 25:41), establishing his kingdom of darkness (Matt. 12:26; Col. 1:13), and became Satan, God's adversary. After God created man, Satan seduced man to follow him and rebel against God. Then God sent His Son to destroy Satan and rescue man out of his authority back to God's kingdom (1 John 3:8; Heb. 2:14; Col. 1:13). Now, when the believers worship God in praying to Him or in speaking for Him, they should bear some signs that they are under God's headship, the divine authority, showing the observing angels (cf. 4:9), who are concerned with this matter, that they (the believers) are keeping God's ordained order in His administration. For this, the sisters should have a sign, a covering, on their head. ",
  "4475":"I.e., in the Lord's plan, in the Lord's arrangement. ",
  "4476":"Man is the source of the woman's existence. Hence, the woman is out of the man. Woman is the means through which the man is born. Hence, the man is through the woman (Gen. 2:21-23). ",
  "4477":"I.e., our natural constitution according to God's creation. Nature itself tells us that man should not have long hair, but that the woman should. The woman realizes by her female constitution that to have long hair to cover her head is a glory. This too is strong ground for the apostle's teaching concerning head covering. His teaching is not according to customs or practices established by man but according to man's nature, which was created by God. ",
  "4478":"The custom of contention, disputation, and debating. Neither the apostles nor the churches tolerated any disputation concerning the apostles' teaching. ",
  "4479":"That churches here is plural indicates that all the local churches are independent of one another, yet they all act in the same way according to the apostles' teaching. ",
  "4480":"But here indicates a contrast between I ...do not praise you in this verse and I praise you in v. 2. ",
  "4481":"From this verse to the end of the chapter the apostle dealt with the eighth problem, the problem concerning the Lord's supper. ",
  "4482":"I.e., in the assembly of the church (14:34-35). ",
  "4483":"Sects, schools of different opinions, as in Gal. 5:20. ",
  "4484":"Tested and found to have met the specifications. ",
  "4485":"Sects are useful for manifesting the approved ones, who are not sectarian. ",
  "4486":"In 10:21 the Lord's supper is called \"the Lord's table.\" The emphasis of the Lord's table is on the fellowship of the Lord's blood and of His body (10:16-17), the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship; whereas the stress of the Lord's supper is on the remembrance of the Lord (vv. 24-25). At the Lord's table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord's supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment. ",
  "4487":"In the apostle's time the believers had a custom of coming together for supper, the main meal of the day, with the rich bringing more and better food for the mutual enjoyment and the poor, less food. This was called a love feast (2 Pet. 2:13; Jude 12), and it came from the background of the Passover feast (Luke 22:13-20). At the end of their love feast they ate the Lord's supper with the bread and the cup to remember the Lord (vv. 23-25). The Corinthians did not do it properly. They did not wait for one another (cf. v. 33). Each took his own supper first. The rich became drunken and the poor were hungry (v. 21). This caused divisions and parties among them (v. 18) and spoiled the Lord's supper. Thus, their eating was not the eating of the Lord's supper (v. 20). ",
  "4488":"Lit., delivered up. ",
  "4489":"The bread is broken that we may eat it (Matt. 26:26). ",
  "4490":"The word unto, here and in the next verse, implies not only a purpose but also a result. Participation in the Lord's supper will surely produce a result &#151; a continual remembrance of the Lord for His satisfaction. ",
  "4491":"To take the Lord's supper is for the remembrance of the Lord Himself, not for anything else. ",
  "4492":"The bread is of life (John 6:35) and the cup is of blessing (10:16). This cup is the new covenant, comprising all the rich blessings of the New Testament, including God Himself. The new covenant was established by the Lord's blood, which He shed on the cross for our redemption (Matt. 26:28). ",
  "4493":"The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (v. 26), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord, who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way. ",
  "4494":"Or, proclaim, display. To take the Lord's supper is not to remember the Lord's death but to declare and display it. We remember the Lord Himself by declaring and displaying His death. ",
  "4495":"We should take the Lord's supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back to set up God's kingdom (Matt. 26:29). By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church. After His death He went away to receive the kingdom, and He will come again with the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12). The period between His first and second comings is the church age. The church thus bridges the gap between the Lord's first coming and His second coming and connects His death in the past with God's kingdom in the future. Hence, to declare the Lord's death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom. When we eat the Lord's supper in this way, with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God's administration. ",
  "4496":"I.e., not respecting the significance of the bread and the cup of the Lord, which signify His body broken for us and His blood shed for our sins through His death, accomplished for our redemption. ",
  "4497":"I.e., bring judgment to himself (vv. 29-30). ",
  "4498":"I.e, examine himself, put himself to the test and have himself approved, meeting the prescribed specifications. ",
  "4499":"Eating the bread or drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner brings judgment to us. This judgment is not a condemnation but the Lord's temporary discipline (v. 32). ",
  "4500":"Lit., to distinguish, separate, discriminate, make a distinction. To fail to discern the Lord's body is to fail to make a distinction between the bread, which signifies the Lord's body, and common food. It is to fail to evaluate the significance of the bread that we take at the Lord's supper. This brings judgment, the Lord's discipline, to us. ",
  "4501":"The apostle used the expression the body instead of the body of the Lord. This may imply the fact that, in addition to the physical body of the Lord (v. 24), there is the mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4). Therefore, when we participate in the Lord's table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man (any denomination). In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord's table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division in practice or in spirit. <br><br>   The apostle's dealing with head covering concerns the Head (v. 3); his dealing with the Lord's supper (the Lord's table) concerns the Body. Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder. Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle's instruction, without any confusion and division. The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church. Christ and the church &#151; these two &#151; are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle's dealings with the confused and disorderly church. In chs. 1--10 he dealt with the church's problems first by stressing Christ as God's center and our portion. After this, in chs. 11--16 he emphasized the church as God's goal and our concern. In chs. 1--10 he began with Christ as the antibiotic to heal the sick church's diseases. Then from ch. 11 he went on to the church and used the church, the Body, as the inoculation against the church's disorder. Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God's administration in His New Testament economy. ",
  "4502":"I.e., not discerning the body. ",
  "4503":"This is the discipline, the temporary judgment of the Lord, on those who participate unworthily in the Lord's body. The Lord first disciplined them, so that they became weak physically. Then, since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined and became sick. Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death. To die in this way is equivalent to being strewn along in the wilderness in 10:5. ",
  "4504":"I.e., have died (1 Thes. 4:13-16). ",
  "4505":"I.e., discriminated ourselves, formed a right estimate of ourselves. ",
  "4506":"Temporarily. ",
  "4507":"Forever. ",
  "4508":"This charge is due to the condition described in v. 21. ",
  "4509":"This indicates that the apostle did not give instructions for everything related to the practice of the church. For \"the rest\" we need to seek the Lord's leading, based on and governed by the principles set forth in the New Testament. ",
  "4510":"In chs. 12--14 Paul dealt with the ninth problem among the Corinthians, the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God's administration and operation. ",
  "4511":"Like a violent wind, the frenzied promoting by the promoters of idolatry among the Greeks in those days was leading people away to idols. Here the apostle referred to the leading of this kind that the Corinthian believers received in the days when they were Gentiles. They were led away to different kinds of idols to worship and serve them, at whatever time and in whatever way they were led by the frenzied ones. ",
  "4512":"The apostle's thought here was that the dumb, voiceless idols in v. 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, \"Jesus is accursed\"; he would like to say, and he is able to say, \"Jesus is Lord!\" No worshippers of God should be silent; all should use their voices to speak forth \"Jesus is Lord!\" in the Spirit of God. This &#151; to speak \"Jesus is Lord!\" &#151; is the main function of all the spiritual gifts. ",
  "4513":"See note 22 in ch. 16. ",
  "4514":"This indicates that when we say with a proper spirit, \"Jesus is Lord!\" we are in the Holy Spirit. Hence, to call on the Lord Jesus is the way to participate in, to enjoy, and to experience the Holy Spirit. ",
  "4515":"But here indicates a contrast between v. 3 and v. 4. Verse 3 says that when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say \"Jesus is Lord!\" exalting Jesus as the Lord. But the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit are different, diverse. ",
  "4516":"Or, diversities, varieties, distributions. So also in vv. 5-6. ",
  "4517":"Gifts here refers to the outward gifts, the abilities or capacities for service. Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts mentioned in 1:7 (see note 1 there). All are different from the initial gifts. ",
  "4518":"I.e., services. The gifts in v. 4 are for these ministries, in which the operations in v. 6 are manifested. ",
  "4519":"Lit., effects of operations. Referring to the result produced by the divine power's energizing of the gifts in their activities. This result is the operation (Eph. 4:16) manifested by the gifts. ",
  "4520":"The gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are initiated by the Lord and are for the Lord; and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is involved in these three matters &#151; the gifts, the ministries, and the operations. The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries for the Lord, and in the ministries for the Lord are manifested the operations of the gifts, produced by God's operating, God's working. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God. ",
  "4521":"All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit, in that the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts. Such manifestation of the Spirit is for the profit of the church, the Body of Christ. ",
  "4522":"I.e., for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ's Body. ",
  "4523":"According to the context of this book, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God, predestined by God to be our portion (1:24, 30; 2:6-10). The word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord (8:1-7). The word of wisdom is mainly out of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly out of our understanding through teaching. The former is deeper than the latter. However, both of these, not speaking in tongues nor any other miraculous gift, are listed as the first gifts and the topmost manifestation of the Spirit because both are the most profitable ministries, or services, for the edification of the saints and the building up of the church to carry out God's operation. ",
  "4524":"Such as the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24. ",
  "4525":"Miraculous power for healing different diseases. ",
  "4526":"Works of miraculous power, miracles, other than healing, such as Peter's raising of Dorcas from the dead (Acts 9:36-42). ",
  "4527":"Speaking for God and speaking forth God, including foretelling and predicting. To speak for God and to speak forth God are gifts out of life, gifts developed by the growth in life; foretelling and predicting are miraculous gifts and have nothing to do with life (see second half of note 10). ",
  "4528":"To distinguish the Spirit that is out of God from those spirits that are not out of God (1 Tim. 4:1; 1 John 4:1-3). ",
  "4529":"A proper language or dialect (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11) either of men or of angels (13:1), not meaningless voices or sounds. The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit (v. 4), one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit (v. 7). Some say that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, and that later it becomes a gift of the Spirit. They say that every believer must speak in tongues as the initial evidence, but that not every believer needs to have the gift of speaking in tongues. This kind of teaching has no ground in the New Testament. The New Testament makes it abundantly clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit and that not all the believers have this gift. ",
  "4530":"To make the unknown tongues known, understandable (14:13). This is the ninth item of the manifestation of the Spirit listed here. However, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers consists of more than nine items. The apostleship, helps, and administrations by the Spirit listed in v. 28, the seeing of visions and the dreaming of dreams by the Spirit mentioned in Acts 2:17, the signs and wonders referred to in Heb. 2:4, and three of the five miraculous acts prophesied in Mark 16:17-18 are not listed here. The apostle listed here only nine items of the Spirit's manifestation as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (14:2-6, 18-19). Of these nine gifts and those listed in vv. 28-30, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. The rest &#151; a word of wisdom (such as the word of the apostles), a word of knowledge (such as the word of the teachers), and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations &#151; are gifts developed by the growth in life (3:6-7), like those listed in Rom. 12:6-8, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1:7 (see note 1 there). The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained infants in Christ (3:1-3). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to the Corinthians. ",
  "4531":"For indicates that this verse is an explanation of v. 11, which says that the one Spirit operates all the various aspects of His manifestation, distributing them to many believers individually. This is just like our physical body in its being one and having many members. ",
  "4532":"Referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as members. All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted with His life and element and have thus become His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body. As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ. ",
  "4533":"As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and as in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, and social rank, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ. ",
  "4534":"The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into (1) Christ, (2) the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3), (3) the name &#151; the person &#151; of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and (4) the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. The apostle was very conscious of this. He was Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who are self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, after this verse he gave the Corinthians a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention was to rescue them from self-seeking back to a concern for the Body, that they might no longer be for their individual profit but for the building up of the Body. ",
  "4535":"Referring to races and nationalities. ",
  "4536":"Referring to social ranks. ",
  "4537":"To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever. This requires us to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water (Isa. 12:3-4; John 4:10, 14). ",
  "4538":"Implying to be mutually adjusted. God has blended all the different members of Christ together into one Body. For this we need much transformation (Rom. 12:2); that is, we need to be transformed from the natural life to the spiritual by the same Spirit for the practical Body life. ",
  "4539":"In the Body life the same care should be given to all the different members. A difference in care causes division. ",
  "4540":"The church here refers to the church in both its universal and local aspects. In vv. 12-27 the church is the Body of Christ. The Body is an organism for Christ as the believers' life to grow and express Himself. The church is an assembly for God to operate His administration. ",
  "4541":"Those who are called and sent by God (1:1; Rom. 1:1) (1) to preach the gospel that sinners may be saved to be the materials for the building of the church, (2) to establish the churches (Acts 14:21-23), and (3) to teach the divine truth (see note 1 in ch. 9). Their ministry is universal for all the churches. ",
  "4542":"Those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation, and who speak sometimes with inspired prediction (Acts 11:27-28). For the edifying of the saints and the establishing of the churches, they are second only to the apostles. ",
  "4543":"Those who teach the truths according to the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42) and the prophets' revelation. Both prophets and teachers are universal as well as local (Eph. 4:11; Acts 13:1). ",
  "4544":"See note 10. ",
  "4545":"See note 9. ",
  "4546":"Or, helpers, helpings. These must refer to the services of the deacons and deaconesses (1 Tim. 3:8-13). ",
  "4547":"Or, administrators, governings; referring to the eldership in the church. ",
  "4548":"See note 10. This is the second time that speaking in tongues is listed as the last of the aspects of God's operation in the church. ",
  "4549":"Speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are again, for the third time, listed last in Paul's writing because they render the least profit to the church (14:4-6, 19). ",
  "4550":"Of course, the answer to this question and the other six is no. ",
  "4551":"Or, be zealous for, delight in. ",
  "4552":"This indicates that some gifts, such as speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues, are smaller because they are less profitable to the church, and that we should desire earnestly the greater gifts, such as prophesying and teaching, which are more profitable for the building up of the church (14:1-6). To have these greater gifts, we need to grow in life unto maturity. The greater gifts are developed, by growth in life, out of the initial gifts (1:7) that we received when we were regenerated. ",
  "4553":"The most excellent way to have the greater gifts is love, which is fully defined in the following chapter. ",
  "4554":"Sounding brass and a clanging cymbal give sounds without life. This is a genuine illustration of tongue-speaking. ",
  "4555":"As a martyr. ",
  "4556":"Some MSS read, that I may be burned. ",
  "4557":"Life is the element of God; love is the expression of God as life. Hence, God is love (1 John 4:16). God as life is expressed in love. All the fifteen virtues of love listed in vv. 4-7 are the divine virtues of God's life. Such a life differs from the outward gifts listed in ch. 12. The Corinthians were pursuing the outward gifts, but they neglected love, the expression of God's life. Hence, they were still fleshy, fleshly, or soulish (3:1, 3; 2:14). They needed to grow in life (expressed by their love in caring for the Body of Christ), pursuing love, not the outward gifts, that they might be spiritual (2:15). ",
  "4558":"The totality of unrighteousness is Satan, and the totality of truth is God. Love as the expression of the divine life does not rejoice over Satan's unrighteousness but rejoices with God's truth. ",
  "4559":"The same Greek word as for bear in 9:12 (see note there). This word means not only (1) to contain, to hold (as a vessel ), and (2) to cover (as a roof ) others' mistakes, but also (3) to shelter and protect by covering (as a roof ). ",
  "4560":"I.e., survives everything, holds its place. Love survives everything and holds its place forever. It never fails, never fades out or comes to an end. It is like the eternal life of God. All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God's operation; they are not life, which expresses God. Hence, they will cease and be rendered useless. They are all dispensational. Only life, which love expresses, is eternal. According to the succeeding verses, all gifts are for the immature child in this age. They will all be rendered useless in the next age. Only love is characteristic of a mature man and will last for eternity. Hence, when we live and act by love, we have a foretaste of the next age and of eternity. ",
  "4561":"In the next age &#151; the kingdom age. ",
  "4562":"Or, mature; in contrast to being a child in the next verse. ",
  "4563":"I.e., prophecies, knowledge, etc., as mentioned in v. 8. ",
  "4564":"In this age the believers are children, having all the childish gifts. ",
  "4565":"I.e., immature. ",
  "4566":"Lit., reckoned. ",
  "4567":"In the next age the mature believers will become men, and all the childish gifts, especially those that are least &#151; tongue-speaking and its interpretation &#151; will be rendered useless. However, we can have a foretaste of the next age by living a life of love in this age. Love matures us in life; gifts keep us in childhood. ",
  "4568":"In this age. ",
  "4569":"Some sources say that this is to see through a window. \"That is, through some medium which, in degree, hinders vision. The word means also `a mirror,' but it is used for window, made, not of clear transparent glass, as now, but of semi-transparent materials\" &#151; J. N. Darby in his New Translation. ",
  "4570":"Lit., in a riddle. ",
  "4571":"In the next age. ",
  "4572":"Faith receives the divine things (John 1:12) and substantiates the spiritual and unseen things (Heb. 11:1). Hope reaps and partakes of the things substantiated by faith (Rom. 8:24-25). Love enjoys the things received and substantiated by faith and partaken of by hope, for nourishing ourselves, building up others (8:1), and expressing God, thus fulfilling the entire law (Rom. 13:8-10). Such love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and it is the most excellent way to have the greater gifts. Hence, it is the greatest of the three abiding virtues. So we must pursue it (14:1). ",
  "4573":"This charge is based on the revelation in 12:31--13:13. To pursue love is to seek after growth in life for the development of the gifts in life. Hence, it must be matched with an earnest desire for the most profitable gift, the gift of prophecy. ",
  "4574":"See note 31 in ch. 12 (so also in v. 39). ",
  "4575":"Since to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, that is, to minister Christ to people, which is the main element in the church meeting, prophesying requires the divine life to fill it as its content. Love is the most excellent way to experience the divine life and make it the content of the gift of prophecy for the building up of the church. Hence, we must pursue love and desire earnestly this greater gift. ",
  "4576":"The apostle's word in vv. 2-6 gives a clear and definite view that speaking in tongues is much less important than prophesying. The apostle strongly belittled the gift of tongues and exalted the gift of prophecy because his main concern was the church, not the individual believers. Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, edifies only the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church. To prophesy in revelation or to teach in knowledge with clear, understandable words is more profitable to the church than to speak in tongues with unknown words (v. 19). ",
  "4577":"Or, edification. Since prophesying, speaking forth the Lord, ministers Christ to people, it builds up people and gives them encouragement and consolation. ",
  "4578":"Prophesying, speaking forth the Lord, builds up not only the individual saints but also the church. ",
  "4579":"Lit., without soul. ",
  "4580":"The apostle's illustrations in vv. 7-11 indicate that the Corinthian believers abused speaking in tongues by doing it in a nonsensical way, uttering sounds with no distinction in the tones (v. 7) and giving forth uncertain sounds (v. 8). They also overused it by practicing it in any place, in any way, and in any situation. Hence, the apostle corrected them and restricted them from abusing and using excessively such a small gift of the least profit, that they might seek the greater gifts and abound in the edifying of the saints and the building up of the church. ",
  "4581":"In Greek the same as sound in vv. 7-8. Here it denotes voices, that is, languages (so also in v. 11). ",
  "4582":"Lit., voiceless. ",
  "4583":"Lit., effect. The same Greek word as for power. ",
  "4584":"The Greek word means a foreigner, i.e., a non-Greek, one who does not speak Greek. \"Supposed to be originally a descriptive word of those who uttered harsh, rude accents. ... Later, the word took the sense of outlandish or rude\" (Vincent). ",
  "4585":"Here the apostle said, \"So also you, since you are zealous of spirits.\" This shows that in their spiritual pursuings in those days, because of their background the Corinthian believers, who were Gentiles by birth, confused the unique Holy Spirit with the various evil spirits; they were not clear about nor did they adequately hold the uniqueness of the Holy Spirit. This is proved by the words but the same Spirit in 12:4. The apostle's word here did not sanction their confused pursuings; rather, based on the fact of their confusion, he exhorted them to seek to transcend and thereby to excel in the midst of their confusion. ",
  "4586":"The Greek word denotes to become full, to abound, to overflow; it also denotes to excel. See note 8 in ch. 8. According to the context of this verse, the word here does not denote to abound, to increase, but to excel and be extraordinary. The words since you are zealous of spirits in the first part of this verse indicate already that in their pursuing of spiritual gifts, the Corinthian believers were confusing the Holy Spirit with the evil spirits. The apostle considered that kind of confused pursuing very demeaning, to the extent that the Corinthian believers might even have been considered barbarians. Therefore, the apostle exhorted them not to pursue some indiscernible, intermixed spiritual things for their own enjoyment and display, but to pursue so as to excel, that is, go beyond the low pursuing, for the building up of the church. ",
  "4587":"The apostle was fully occupied with the consideration of building up the church. He was fully church-conscious and church-centered, altogether different from the self-centered Corinthians. Their problem with spiritual gifts was due to their self-seeking, their not caring for the building up of the church. In dealing with the first six problems, which were in the realm of human life, the apostle stressed Christ as God's unique portion to us; in dealing with the last five problems, which were in the realm of the divine administration, he emphasized the church as God's unique goal for us. The Corinthians were not only void of Christ but also ignorant of the church. The apostle's completing ministry (Col. 1:25) is composed of Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). However, the Corinthians missed both, even though they were under the apostle's ministry. They were pitifully in themselves, blind and ignorant. ",
  "4588":"For our spirit to be used and exercised in prayer is surely healthy for our spiritual life. But for our mind to be unfruitful and unused is absolutely unhealthy. In praying to the Lord, we must exercise our regenerated spirit and our renewed mind. Our mind should be set on our spirit (Rom. 8:6) and should never be detached from it, even in our daily walk, needless to say in our prayer. Our prayer must be from our God-contacted and God-contacting spirit and through our sober and understanding mind, with clear and understandable words, that our prayer may touch God, nourish and strengthen ourselves, and build up others. ",
  "4589":"This implies that the apostle encouraged the receivers of his letter to pray not only in an unknown tongue but also with clear and understandable words. ",
  "4590":"This does not mean to pray with the mind only and not at all with the spirit. In Eph. 6:18 the apostle charged us to pray at every time in spirit. Prayer is worship, which should be in spirit (John 4:24). When we pray with the spirit, not in an unknown tongue but in understandable words, our mind is automatically used to interpret and express the thought of the spirit. What the apostle meant here is that in the church meeting, for the profit of all the attendants, we should pray with our mind in intelligible words (v. 19) to express the burden in our spirit. In a church meeting our prayer not only should be heard by the Lord for His answer but also should be intelligible to all the attendants for their profit. For this purpose we should learn to use our mind in public prayer just as we use our spirit, training our mind to cooperate with our spirit, even to be one with our spirit, that the spirit may become the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). ",
  "4591":"Lit., layman; i.e., one who is brought into a certain matter untaught, uninstructed (so also in vv. 23-24). ",
  "4592":"This reveals that in the church meetings during the apostle's time, when one prayed, all the others said Amen, even \"the Amen\" with emphasis. ",
  "4593":"This indicates that not only our prophesying and teaching in the church meetings but also our prayers and thanks to the Lord should build up others. This shows how much the apostle was concerned with the building up of the church and the saints. His word in this verse is not only a correction but a charge. ",
  "4594":"This shows how much speaking in intelligible words is needed in the church meeting for the building up of the church, and that speaking in tongues is not needed at all. ",
  "4595":"See note 15. ",
  "4596":"The Corinthian believers were not only infants in life (3:1) but also children in understanding. They needed to grow both in life and in their mind's understanding. All the apostle's efforts to deal with their problems were for this purpose, that they might mature in every way. ",
  "4597":"Or, thinking, reasoning, mind. In Greek the word is different from the word for mind in vv. 15 and 19, which \"emphasizes the distinction from ecstasy\" (Vincent). This is in regard to the Corinthian believers' understanding and thinking concerning speaking in tongues. They were ecstatic in this practice and thus were childish in their understanding concerning it, not using their mind properly as a mature believer should. The apostle advised them to grow and become full-grown in their understanding, that is, in the proper use of their mind, as he had done (v. 19), in the matter of tongue-speaking. ",
  "4598":"The childish Corinthian believers needed to become full-grown in their understanding that they might be able to know the things that are mentioned in vv. 21-25. ",
  "4599":"Referring to the Old Testament. See note 34. ",
  "4600":"This word in Isa. 28:9-13 indicates that the speaking in strange tongues was a chastisement to the children of Israel because they did not believe the intelligible word of God. Hence, the apostle's quoting of this word implies that the Corinthians had not properly received the intelligible revelation of God through the apostles. ",
  "4601":"So then at the beginning of this verse indicates that according to the word in v. 21 quoted from Isa. 28, tongues are for a negative sign to the unbelievers, signifying their poor condition of unbelief. It implies that wherever a strange tongue is spoken, people's unbelief is there. The apostle's intention here was to hold the Corinthians back from their excessive practice of speaking in tongues. But prophecy is for a positive sign to those who believe, signifying their proper condition of belief. This is an encouragement to the practice of prophesying. ",
  "4602":"If in a meeting of the whole church all speak in tongues, an observer might consider that all the attendants are insane. Hence, to encourage all to speak in tongues in the church meeting is not right; it is against the apostle Paul's word. ",
  "4603":"Or, mad, raving mad. This word is a strong discouragement to the excessive speaking in tongues. ",
  "4604":"This implies that all the attendants have not only the obligation but also the capacity to prophesy. If all prophesy in the church meeting, people will be convicted. This kind of prophesying must not be mainly to predict but to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. ",
  "4605":"This would not result from the prophecy of prediction but from the prophecy of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord. This latter kind of prophecy requires some amount of growth in life. This word also is an encouragement to the practice of prophesying. ",
  "4606":"This implies that prophesying, speaking for God and speaking forth God with God as the content, ministers God to the hearers and brings them to God. This also indicates that the church meeting should be filled with God, and that all its activities should convey and transmit God to people that they may be infused with God. ",
  "4607":"Has, occurring five times in this verse, is a widely used Greek word, a word with many meanings, of which the following three are the main ones: (1) to hold, to possess, to keep (a certain thing); (2) to have (a certain thing) for enjoyment; (3) to have the means or power to do a certain thing. The first two meanings should be applied to the first three of the five items listed in this verse, and the third to the last two &#151; a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of the prophet, v. 30) to give visions of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ as God's mystery and the church as Christ's mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers (v. 22) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with such things from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit &#151; their enlightenment, nourishment, and building up. <br><br>   This is like the Feast of Tabernacles in ancient times. The children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they had reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for their mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer. Thus the meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and will be a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church. <br><br>   According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five items listed in this verse should focus on Christ as God's center for our portion and the church as God's goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise to God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ and the church, which is the Body of Christ, to people. A tongue and its interpretation also should have Christ and the church as their center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will bring confusion to the church and distract it from the central lane of God's New Testament economy, making it like the church in Corinth. ",
  "4608":"Or, edification. Whatever we do in the church meeting must be for the building up of the saints and the church. To exhibit Christ and enjoy Him in the meetings for the building up of His Body must be our unique purpose and goal. ",
  "4609":"This indicates that the church meeting is the church itself. ",
  "4610":"Or, judge. Lit., discriminate. This is to judge or discern whether what is prophesied is of God or not, discriminating the right from the wrong. This indicates that some prophesying may not be of God. ",
  "4611":"God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him (v. 1b; cf. Num. 11:29). ",
  "4612":"Or, comforted. ",
  "4613":"This means that the prophets are not under the control of their spirits, but their spirits are under their direction. Thus, they can determine when to prophesy and when to cease prophesying, to maintain good order in the church meeting. Their spirits are not their master but their means to function. They should learn how to exercise and use their spirits at their discretion. ",
  "4614":"The principle of the charges in vv. 26-32, mainly concerning speaking in tongues and prophesying, is that a peaceful and becoming order, according to what God Himself is, should be kept. ",
  "4615":"This indicates that all the local churches should be the same in practice. ",
  "4616":"Verses 1:2 and 10:32 use the term the church of God. But here we read the churches of the saints. The church of God points to the element that constitutes the church: the church is constituted with the element of God. The churches of the saints points to the components of the churches: the churches are composed of the saints. ",
  "4617":"This means in the church meetings. See note 28. So also in v. 35. ",
  "4618":"According to 11:5, women may prophesy (of course, in public) with their head covered, and Acts 2:17-18 and 21:9 confirm that women did prophesy. But 1 Tim. 2:12 says that women are not permitted to teach, that is, teach as authorities (there, teaching is related to the exercising of authority), so as to define doctrine. Hence, according to the New Testament principle, for women not to be permitted to speak in the church meetings means that women are not permitted to teach with authority in relation to the defining of doctrine. In this sense they should be silent in the church meetings. They are not permitted to speak, because they should be subject to men. This is related to the matter of authority ordained by God in His government. In God's governmental ordination, women are not permitted to speak with authority over men. They may pray and prophesy, that is, (mainly) speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. However, they must do this under the covering of the brothers, because they are charged here to be subject. ",
  "4619":"Referring to the books written by Moses (Matt. 5:17; 7:12; 11:13). In Moses' writings, Gen. 3:16 charges the woman to be subject to man's rule. This is God's ordination. ",
  "4620":"This too indicates that a local church should follow the other churches in its practice. All the local churches should submit to the universal order of the Spirit according to the word of the apostles, from whom the word of God goes forth. ",
  "4621":"This too indicates that to be a prophet or to be a spiritual person is highly esteemed in the church for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy. A prophet is second to an apostle in God's administration in the church (12:28). He is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God, and who has received revelation of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church (Eph. 3:5), which revelation is the foundation for the building of the church (Eph. 2:20). A spiritual person is one who lives according to his spirit, which is mingled with God's Spirit, and who is able to discern all the spiritual things (3:1 and notes; 2:15 and note). Such spiritually knowledgeable persons should fully know that the apostle Paul's teachings are the commandment of the Lord, and their speaking should correspond with his teachings. Paul's spirit was strong and his word was frank in dealing with the disorderly Corinthians. He charged them to know definitely that his teachings were a commandment of the Lord, having the authentic authority of the Lord. ",
  "4622":"Since the apostle's teachings are according to God's ordination (v. 34), they are the commandment of the Lord. ",
  "4623":"Actually, this entire chapter deals with prophesying and speaking in tongues. Since prophesying is the most profitable gift for building up both the saints and the church with the rich ministry of Christ, it was highly esteemed and promoted by the apostle. Since speaking in tongues affords no profit for building up, the apostle was faithful to expose its lesser value. Both the apostle's esteeming and his exposing were according to his concern for the fulfilling of God's purpose in building up the church with the riches of Christ. At the conclusion of this chapter he still charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy for God's building. However, in order to keep the all-inclusiveness and oneness of the church, he also charged us not to forbid speaking in tongues. ",
  "4624":"The apostle's concern for the church was that Christ as God's center and the church as God's goal might be carried on and carried out, with all things done becomingly and in good order before men and the angels (4:9; 11:10). Our natural life is useless in fulfilling such a high purpose. The experience of Christ crucified (1:23; 2:2) for the termination of our self and the experience of Christ in resurrection as our daily sanctification and redemption (1:30) are needed for a proper church life. ",
  "4625":"The full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans (Rom. 1:1; 16:25). ",
  "4626":"We should stand in the full gospel, that is, in the entire New Testament, not just in certain teachings or doctrines. ",
  "4627":"Or, in the way of salvation (Conybeare). Having been justified in Christ and regenerated by the Spirit, we are in the process of being saved in the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10), and will be until we are mature and conformed to Him in full (Rom. 8:29). ",
  "4628":"Christ's death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, which were according to the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isa. 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa. 22:14-18; Dan. 9:26; Isa. 53:9; Psa. 16:9-10; Hosea 6:2), are the basic items among the first things of the gospel. The last of these items is the most vital in the gospel, for it is the positive aspect of the gospel in that it imparts life to us that we may obtain life and live Christ. ",
  "4629":"The Old Testament, that is, the Law and the Prophets. ",
  "4630":"Or, was seen by. The earlier apostles and disciples were eyewitnesses of Christ's resurrection (Acts 1:22), and their preaching stressed their testimony to this (Acts 2:32; 4:33). They witnessed to the resurrected Christ not only by their teaching but also by their living. They lived with Him by His living in resurrection (John 14:19). ",
  "4631":"Grace, mentioned three times in this verse, is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (v. 45) to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection. Thus, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us. (See notes 17 in John 1 and 21 in Gal. 2.) It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15-16), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the apostles. His ministry and living by this grace are an undeniable testimony to Christ's resurrection. ",
  "4632":"Not I but the grace of God equals no longer I ...but ...Christ in Gal. 2:20. The grace that motivated the apostle and operated in him was not some matter or some thing but a living person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwelt in the apostle as his everything. ",
  "4633":"In this chapter the apostle dealt with the Corinthians' heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead. The Corinthians were like the Sadducees (Matt. 22:23; Acts 23:8). This was the tenth problem among them. It is the most damaging and destructive to God's New Testament economy, worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection (2 Tim. 2:17-18). Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not of the living (Matt. 22:32). If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever (Rev. 1:18) and is able to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death (Rom. 4:25 and note), no imparting of life (John 12:24), no regeneration (John 3:5), no renewing (Titus 3:5), no transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and no conformity to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (Rom. 12:5), no Body of Christ as His fullness (Eph. 1:20-23), and no church as Christ's bride (John 3:29), and therefore no new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11). If there were no resurrection, God's New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God's eternal purpose would be nullified. ",
  "4634":"I.e., empty, void. Without the living Christ in resurrection, both the proclamation of the gospel and our faith in the gospel would be empty and void, having no reality. ",
  "4635":"I.e., fruitless, worthless. If Christ had not been resurrected to live in us as our life and everything, our faith in Him would be fruitless, worthless, and without any issue, such as the impartation of life, freedom from sin, victory over Satan, and growth in life. ",
  "4636":"Christ's death saves us from being condemned because of our sins, not from the power of sin. It is His resurrection life that delivers us from the power of sin (Rom. 8:2). If Christ had not been resurrected, we would still remain in sins and under the power of sin. ",
  "4637":"I.e., died (1 Thes. 4:13-16). ",
  "4638":"I.e., not to be resurrected but to remain in death forever. ",
  "4639":"If there were no resurrection, we would have no future and no hope for the future, such as Christ as our hope of glory (Col. 1:27), the lot of our eternal blessing (Dan. 12:13), the reign with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6), and the reward of the resurrection of the just (Luke 14:14). All these hopes are connected to our resurrection. ",
  "4640":"Verses 20-28 are a parenthetical word verifying the truth of resurrection by setting forth Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection. ",
  "4641":"Christ was the first One raised from among the dead, becoming the firstfruits of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits (a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord's resurrection &#151; Matt. 27:52-53) in Lev. 23:10-11, which were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1). Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection is the Firstborn from among the dead that He might be the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:20-23). Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, also will be resurrected. ",
  "4642":"I.e., Adam, the first man (v. 45). ",
  "4643":"I.e., Christ, the second man (v. 47). Adam brought in death through sin (Rom. 5:12); Christ brought in the life of resurrection through righteousness (Rom. 5:17-18). The death brought in by Adam works in us from our birth by our parents until the death of our body. The life of resurrection brought in by Christ operates in us, as signified by baptism (Rom. 6:4), from our regeneration by the Spirit of God (John 3:5) until the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21). ",
  "4644":"In Adam we were born in death and were born to die; we are dead in him (Eph. 2:1, 5). ",
  "4645":"In Christ we have been reborn in life and resurrected to live; we have been enlivened, made alive, in Him (Eph. 2:5-6). ",
  "4646":"See note 20. Christ as the firstfruits is first in order in the resurrection from the dead. ",
  "4647":"The believers in Christ, the righteous, who will be resurrected unto life at the Lord's coming back before the millennium (John 5:29; Luke 14:14; 1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52; Rev. 20:4-6). They will be second in order in the resurrection from the dead. ",
  "4648":"In the preceding verse the order of resurrection is mentioned: the first, Christ; then those who are Christ's. Accordingly, in this verse, after then, one would expect a group of people to be named. However, here it does not tell us who, but it says \"the end,\" because those who will be resurrected at the end in their own order are not in Christ. <br><br>   The end here is the end of all the ages and dispensations of the old creation. It is also the end of the millennium before the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1). In all the ages and dispensations God, on one hand, has been dealing with His enemy Satan and all the negative things in the universe; on the other hand, He has been accomplishing all things for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. The last of the ages and dispensations will be the millennium, the kingdom age, after which all God's dealings and accomplishments will be fully completed. That completion will be the end, the conclusion, of all God's work. At this end all the dead unbelievers, the unrighteous, will be resurrected unto judgment for eternal perdition (John 5:29; Rev. 20:5, 11-15). They will be third in order in the resurrection. ",
  "4649":"When Christ annuls the satanic authority, subdues all His enemies (v. 25), abolishes death (v. 26), and delivers up the kingdom to God the Father, that is, when all the negative things are done away with and the entire purpose of God is fulfilled, the old creation will be concluded. ",
  "4650":"After accomplishing redemption, Christ went to receive the kingdom from the Father (Luke 19:12, 15). Before the millennium He as the Son of Man will have received the kingdom from God, the Ancient of days, to rule all the nations for one thousand years (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 20:4, 6). At the end of the millennium, after He has defeated Satan, the devil, and his evil angels (as all rule, authority, and power), and even death and Hades, putting all His enemies under His feet (vv. 25-26) and casting all of them, including death and Hades, into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10, 14), He will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father. ",
  "4651":"In the millennium, the last age of the old creation. ",
  "4652":"Immediately after the fall of man, God began His work to abolish sin and death. This work has been progressing through the Old and New Testament ages and is still in progress today. When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation, and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10), death will be abolished. It will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the final judgment at the white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). ",
  "4653":"Referring to God, who has subjected all things under Christ's feet. This is a reference to Psa. 8:6-8 concerning Christ as the man whom God caused to have dominion over all things. This will be fulfilled when all the things mentioned in vv. 24-26 have taken place. For at the beginning of the verse indicates this. ",
  "4654":"Referring to Christ as the man prophesied in Psa. 8:4-8. To Him &#151; the resurrected, glorified, and exalted man &#151; God has subjected all things (Heb. 2:7-9; Eph. 1:20-22). ",
  "4655":"Christ, according to v. 27, to whom God has subjected all things. ",
  "4656":"Christ, the Son of God, as the head of mankind in His humanity, is under the headship of God the Father (11:3). This is for the government of God's kingdom. After God the Father has subjected all things under the feet of Christ as a resurrected man in glory (Eph. 1:22; Heb. 2:7-8), and after Christ as such a resurrected man has put all enemies under His feet to execute God the Father's subjection of all things to Him, He as the Son of God, along with His delivering of the kingdom back to God the Father (v. 24), will also subject Himself in His divinity to God, who has subjected all things to Him, the Son in His humanity. This indicates the Son's absolute subjection and subordination to the Father, which exalts the Father that God the Father may be all in all. ",
  "4657":"God, according to v. 27, who has subjected all things to Christ. ",
  "4658":"The same Greek word as for all things at the beginning of this verse. ",
  "4659":"Considering vv. 20-28 a parenthesis, this verse should be connected with v. 18, and vv. 30-32 with v. 19. ",
  "4660":"This should not have been an official matter generally practiced by the early churches but a personal activity of some individual believers on behalf of dead persons for whom they were concerned, who might have believed in the Lord but not been baptized before they died. They did this in hope of the dead ones' being resurrected from the dead at the Lord's coming back (1 Thes. 4:16), since in baptism resurrection is strongly signified (Col. 2:12). The apostle used what they did to confirm the truth of resurrection. This does not mean, however, that he sanctioned some believers' being baptized for the dead. ",
  "4661":"The Corinthian believers were the fruit of the apostle's labor, a labor in which he risked his life. In them the apostle could boast of this. By this boasting he protested that daily he died, that is, daily he risked death, faced death, and died to self (2 Cor. 11:23; 4:11; 1:8-9; Rom. 8:36). ",
  "4662":"At this point, in his word concerning resurrection the apostle used his experience in the Lord's work to confirm the matter of resurrection, especially the effect of Christ's resurrection on him. The apostle's boasting in the Corinthians, who were the fruit of his risking of his life, was in the resurrected Christ, not in himself, because his risking of death in his labor for them was not by himself but by the resurrected Christ. ",
  "4663":"In those days men fought against evil persons or matters in order to receive a temporal reward. But the apostle did not fight after that manner when he fought with evil persons and matters for the gospel's sake. Rather, he fought according to a higher hope in order to be rewarded at the resurrection in the future (Luke 14:14; 2 Tim. 4:8). ",
  "4664":"A figure of speech denoting evil persons or matters (2 Tim. 4:17). ",
  "4665":"This appears to be a quotation of a saying of that day, a maxim of the Epicureans. If there is no resurrection, we believers have no hope for the future and have become the most miserable of all men (v. 19). If so, we had better enjoy our life today, forgetting the future, as the Epicureans did. ",
  "4666":"This appears to be a quotation of a saying of that day, a fragment of a Greek poem. By this word the apostle warned the Corinthian believers not to have any companionship with those heretics who said that there is no resurrection. Such evil companionship would corrupt their faith and their Christian virtues. ",
  "4667":"Or, company. ",
  "4668":"Or, Cease, righteously, to be drunken. Righteously means being right with God and with man. To say that there is no resurrection offends God and man. This is to commit sin and thereby be unrighteous. Hence, the apostle advised the misled Corinthians to awake soberly from this sin and restore a right relationship with God and man. They were drunken unrighteously in the stupor of the no-resurrection heresy. They needed to cease being in that stupor. ",
  "4669":"To be heretical in saying that there is no resurrection is to be ignorant of God, not knowing God's power and economy (Matt. 22:29-32). This is a shame to the believers. ",
  "4670":"The reality of resurrection is contained and concealed in nature, especially in the plant life. A seed sown into the earth dies and is made alive. This is resurrection. This answered the foolish Corinthians' first question, \"How are the dead raised?\" (v. 35). ",
  "4671":"Not the body sown to die (v. 37) but the resurrected body given by God, in a different shape and on a higher level. This answered the Corinthians' foolish question, \"With what kind of body do they come?\" (v. 35). ",
  "4672":"In vv. 39-41 the apostle proved to the foolish Corinthians that God is able to give a body to all resurrected lives, just as He gave a body to all created things: to men and animals on the earth, to birds in the air, and to fish in the water &#151; the earthly bodies with their different glories; and to the sun, the moon, and the stars &#151; heavenly bodies with heavenly glory in varying degrees. ",
  "4673":"A soulish body is a natural body animated by the soul, a body in which the soul predominates. A spiritual body is a resurrected body saturated by the spirit, a body in which the spirit predominates. When we die, our natural body, being soulish, will be sown, i.e., buried, in corruption, in dishonor, and in weakness. When it is resurrected, it will become spiritual in incorruption, in glory, and in power (vv. 42-43). ",
  "4674":"Through creation Adam became a living soul with a soulish body. Through resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation He became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29); then, in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the imparting of life (John 10:10b). Through incarnation He had a soulish body, as Adam had; through resurrection He has a spiritual body. His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection. Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (6:17). Our spirit is made alive and is resurrected with Him. Eventually, our present soulish body will become a spiritual body in resurrection, just like His (vv. 52-54; Phil. 3:21). ",
  "4675":"Christ, the second man (v. 47). ",
  "4676":"Adam, the first man (v. 47). ",
  "4677":"Out of the earth denotes the origin of the first man, Adam, and earthy, his nature. ",
  "4678":"Christ is not only the last Adam (v. 45) but also the second man. The first Adam (v. 45) is the beginning of mankind; the last Adam is the ending. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are only two men: the first man, Adam, including all his descendants, and the second man, Christ, comprising all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth and became a part of the second man by regeneration. Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second. In regard to our being part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy. In regard to our being part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly. ",
  "4679":"Out of heaven denotes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature of the second man, Christ. ",
  "4680":"The first man, Adam, who is earthy. ",
  "4681":"All of Adam's descendants, who are earthy, like Adam. ",
  "4682":"The second man, Christ, who is heavenly. ",
  "4683":"All the believers in Christ, who are heavenly, like Christ. ",
  "4684":"As a part of Adam, we have borne the earthy man's image through birth; as a part of Christ, we will bear the heavenly man's image in resurrection. This indicates that just as in Adam we have been born as those who are earthy, so in Christ we will be resurrected as those who are heavenly. Such a resurrection is our destiny. It is as sure as our birth and should never be questioned. ",
  "4685":"Flesh and blood are the components of the soulish body, which is corruptible and is not qualified to inherit the kingdom of God, which is incorruptible. Corruption cannot inherit incorruption. Our corruptible body must be resurrected into an incorruptible one that we may be able to inherit the incorruptible kingdom of God in resurrection. ",
  "4686":"The transfiguration, including the resurrection, of our corruptible body into an incorruptible one (Phil. 3:21). This is mysterious to human understanding. ",
  "4687":"I.e., die (11:30; John 11:11-13; 1 Thes. 4:13-16). ",
  "4688":"I.e., transfigured from corruption, dishonor, and weakness to incorruption, glory, and power (vv. 42-43). This is to have the body of our humiliation conformed to the body of Christ's glory (Phil. 3:21). ",
  "4689":"The seventh trumpet (Rev. 11:15), the trumpet of God (1 Thes. 4:16). ",
  "4690":"The dead in Christ, the dead believers (1 Thes. 4:16). ",
  "4691":"We believers who are living at the time of the Lord's return. The dead saints will be resurrected first; then the living ones will be changed, transfigured, in rapture (1 Thes. 4:15-17). ",
  "4692":"Referring to our corruptible and mortal body, which must put on incorruption and immortality either through our being resurrected from the dead or through our being transfigured while still alive. This is mysterious and incomprehensible to the natural sight. ",
  "4693":"I.e., when our corrupted and mortal body is resurrected or transfigured from corruption and death into glory and life. Then death will be swallowed up unto victory. This is the consummation of the resurrection we share in God's economy through the redemption and salvation in Christ. This resurrection begins with the enlivening of our dead spirit and is completed with the transfiguration of our corruptible body. Between these two ends is the process in which our fallen soul is metabolically transformed by the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of resurrection (2 Cor. 3:18). ",
  "4694":"Death is a defeat to man. Through Christ's salvation in the resurrection life, death will be swallowed up unto victory to us, the beneficiaries of Christ's resurrection life. ",
  "4695":"This chapter is on resurrection. Christ's resurrection was His victory over Satan, God's enemy, over the world, over sin, and over death. After His triumphal ascension to the height (Eph. 4:8) in His resurrection, God subdued all the enemies for Him (v. 25). Then, as One who is in resurrection, He will come to the earth with the kingdom of God (Dan. 7:13-14) to exercise God's power and subdue everything on earth. This will continue for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). The last enemy to be abolished is death. The swallowing up of death will result in the ultimate victory of the Lord's resurrection, that is, in the ultimate and complete victory that He has accomplished in resurrection for us who believe in Him and participate in His resurrection. This is the ultimate issue of His resurrection for His and God's eternal kingdom and for the eternal enjoyment of His resurrection life in eternity by those who believe in Him. ",
  "4696":"This is the apostle's triumphant exclamation concerning the victory of resurrection life over death. ",
  "4697":"Death is of the devil (Heb. 2:14), and through sin it stings us to death (Rom. 5:12). In God's redemption Christ was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21) in order that God might condemn sin through Christ's death (Rom. 8:3), thus abolishing the sting of death. Then, through Christ's resurrection death is swallowed up by the resurrection life. ",
  "4698":"Sin brings to us a curse and condemnation, both in our conscience and before God, through the law (Rom. 4:15; 5:13, 20; 7:7-8). Hence, the law becomes the power of sin to kill us (Rom. 7:10-11). Since Christ's death has fulfilled the law's requirements on us (1 Pet. 3:18; 2:24), the power of sin has been annulled. Through the death of Christ sin has been condemned and the law has been annulled, and through His resurrection death has been swallowed up. Therefore, we must give thanks to God, who gives us such a victory over sin and death through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ (v. 57). ",
  "4699":"This victory over sin and death through Christ's death and resurrection should not be merely an accomplished fact for our acceptance; it must become our daily experience in life through the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit (v. 45), who is one with our spirit (6:17). Hence, we should live by and walk according to this mingled spirit. Thus thanks will be given continuously to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. ",
  "4700":"To question the truth of resurrection is to be shaken. To be assured and remain in the reality of resurrection is to be steadfast, immovable. ",
  "4701":"Not believing in the truth of resurrection causes us to be disappointed concerning our future, thus making us discouraged in the work of the Lord. Faith gives us a strong aspiration to abound in the work of the Lord with the expectation of pleasing the Lord in resurrection at His coming back. ",
  "4702":"Not by our natural life and natural ability but by the Lord's resurrection life and power. Our labor for the Lord in His resurrection life with His resurrection power will never be in vain, but will result in the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose through the preaching of Christ to sinners, the ministering of life to the saints, and the building up of the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones (3:12). This labor will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous (3:14; Matt. 25:21, 23; Luke 14:14). ",
  "4703":"This is the eleventh matter dealt with by the apostle in this Epistle, a matter concerned with money, mammon, and material possessions. All of fallen mankind is under the domination of mammon and material possessions (Matt. 6:19-21, 24-25, 30; 19:21-22; Luke 12:13-19). On the day of Pentecost, under the power of the Holy Spirit, all the believers overthrew this domination and had all their possessions in common for distribution to the needy ones (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32, 34-37). Because of the weakness of the believers' fallen nature (cf. Acts 5:1-11; 6:1), that practice did not last long. It had already ended by the apostle Paul's time. Hence, the believers needed grace to overcome the power of mammon and material things and to release these things from Satan's domination that they might be offered to the Lord for the fulfillment of His purpose. Resurrection life is the supply for the believers to live such a life, a life trusting in God, not in material possessions, a life not for today but for the future, not for this age but for the coming age (Luke 12:16-21; 1 Tim. 6:17-19), a life that overthrows the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches. This may be the reason that the dealing with this matter comes after the dealing concerning the reality of resurrection life. In any case, this dealing is related to God's administration among the churches. ",
  "4704":"Again, this strongly indicates that all the local churches should be the same in their practice (7:17; 11:16; 14:33). ",
  "4705":"The seventh day of the week, the Sabbath, was a memorial of God's creation (Gen. 2:1-3; Exo. 20:8, 11). The first day of the week is a symbol of the Lord's resurrection; it is the day on which the Lord resurrected from the dead (John 20:1 and note 1) and is called \"the Lord's Day\" (Rev. 1:10). The New Testament saints meet and offer their possessions on this day (Acts 20:7), the day of the Lord's resurrection, signifying that they have been resurrected with the Lord (Eph. 2:6) through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3) and that they meet in resurrection by the resurrection life, not by their natural life, to remember the Lord and worship God with their offerings. ",
  "4706":"Lit., grace. This was a kind of fellowship, under the apostle's direction, of the churches in the Gentile world with the church in Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:1-2; Rom. 15:25-27). ",
  "4707":"This Epistle was written in Ephesus, where the apostle stayed for three years on the third journey of his ministry (Acts 19:21-22; 20:1, 31). ",
  "4708":"By this the Corinthians should have realized that Paul's attitude toward Apollos and his relationship with him were in sharp contrast to their preferences (1:11-12). His attitude and relationship kept the oneness; their preferences caused division. ",
  "4709":"Both Paul and Apollos were persons living in the Spirit. Yet, one urged the other to visit the church, but the other did not have the desire to do so. This shows that both had freedom in the Spirit and that the Spirit had freedom in them. This shows also that no one exercised any control over the work of the Lord. ",
  "4710":"I.e., do not be shaken by any heresy, especially the one that says there is no resurrection. ",
  "4711":"The objective faith; referring to what we believe. ",
  "4712":"I.e., those who are strong in the faith and firm in their standing, not like a child in understanding (14:20) or like little children tossed by waves and carried about by the winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14). To be such men, growth in life is needed (3:1, 6). The Corinthian believers neglected the growth in life and were short of it. ",
  "4713":"As defined in ch. 13. ",
  "4714":"This must have been by the riches of Christ ministered by one's spirit, which can touch others' spirits. ",
  "4715":"Our contact and relationship with the saints must be in and by our spirit, not our soulish emotion. ",
  "4716":"This means that when Aquila and Prisca lived in Ephesus, the church there met in their home (Acts 18:18-19, 26). When they lived in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home (Rom. 16:5; cf. Col. 4:15-16; Philem. 2). ",
  "4717":"Verses 10-21 present a picture of the actual practice of the Body life in a beautiful harmony, not only among the apostle and his co-workers but also between them and the churches for the building up of the Body, which is so strongly stressed in chs. 12--14. ",
  "4718":"Gk. anathema, meaning a thing or person accursed; i.e., set apart, devoted, to woe. Our loving God makes us those who are blessed of God to share the divine blessings that He has ordained and prepared for us, which are beyond our apprehension (2:9). Our not loving the Lord makes us those who are accursed, set apart to a curse. What a warning! ",
  "4719":"Maranatha, from Aramaic, meaning The Lord comes! or, Our Lord come! It is an exclamation reminding us that the Lord's second coming is with judgment. ",
  "4720":"See note 10 in ch. 15. ",
  "4721":"Not a natural love but love in Christ, love in resurrection (4:21), the love of God that becomes ours through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). Of Paul's fourteen Epistles, only this one ends with such a word of the assurance of love. This is because the apostle had been dealing with them with strong rebukes (1:13; 3:3; 4:7-8; 5:2, 5; 6:5-8; 11:17). He was faithful, honest, and frank toward them in the love of God in Christ (2 Cor. 2:4), without being political. Hence, the Lord honored his dealings, and the Corinthians accepted his rebukes and repented, resulting in their being benefited (2 Cor. 7:8-13). ",
  "4722":"See note 1 in 1 Cor. 1. ",
  "4723":"See note 2 in 1 Cor. 1. ",
  "4724":"See note 2 in 1 Cor. 1. ",
  "4725":"See note 2 in 1 Cor. 1. ",
  "4726":"A province of the Roman Empire south of Macedonia. It constituted the greater part of today's Greece, where the city of Corinth is. ",
  "4727":"Or, mercies, pity, sympathy. ",
  "4728":"Comfort implies being cheered. A title such as the Father of compassions and God of all comfort is ascribed here to God because this Epistle is one of comfort and encouragement, written by the apostle after he had been comforted and encouraged by the repentance of the Corinthian believers. The rebuking and condemning in the first Epistle to the Corinthians were intended to cause the Corinthian believers to turn back to and stress Christ; the comfort and encouragement in this Epistle were intended to bring them to experience and enjoy Christ. ",
  "4729":"We must first experience God's comforting; then we are able to comfort others with the comfort from God that we have experienced. <br><br>   The first Epistle to the Corinthians was the apostle's argument, an argument that defeated and subdued the distracted and confused Corinthians. Now the second Epistle brought them back into the experience of Christ, who was the subject of his argument in the first Epistle. Hence, the second Epistle is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the first. In the first, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, the church, and the gifts are covered as the major subjects. In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are developed further, but the gifts are not even mentioned. The gifts are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ gained through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. This Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These processes constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God's new covenant. The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The ministry is for ministering the Christ whom we have experienced, whereas the gifts are just for teaching the doctrines concerning Christ. Not the gifts but the ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings, the afflictions, of Christ is the proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ. ",
  "4730":"Not sufferings for Christ but Christ's own sufferings as shared by His disciples (Matt. 20:22; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 4:13). ",
  "4731":"The Christ here is a designation of the condition of Christ; it is not a name (Darby). Here it refers to the suffering Christ, who suffered afflictions for His Body according to God's will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received comfort. ",
  "4732":"I.e., weighed down, pressed down. The same Greek word as in 5:4. ",
  "4733":"In Greek the same word as for utterly without a way out in 4:8. ",
  "4734":"Or, life. ",
  "4735":"In this book the apostle is presented as a pattern of a person living Christ in five aspects for the church: (1) not basing his confidence on himself but on God, who raises the dead (v. 9), which includes related matters such as conducting himself in the world not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God (v. 12) and being one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God (vv. 18-20); (2) being attached to Christ, anointed and sealed by His Spirit, and captured, subdued, and led by Him to scatter His savor (vv. 21-22; 2:14-16); (3) being sufficient of Christ as the spiritual alphabet to write living letters with the life-giving Spirit of the living God (3:3-6); (4) having the shining of the glory of the new covenant (3:7-11); and (5) being transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit, by beholding and reflecting like a mirror His glory with unveiled face (3:16-18). ",
  "4736":"Or, answer. When the apostles were under the pressure of affliction, despairing even of life, they might have asked themselves what the issue of their suffering would be. The answer or response was \"death.\" This led them to the vital decision not to base their confidence on themselves but on God, who raises the dead. ",
  "4737":"The experience of death ushers us into the experience of resurrection. Resurrection is the very God, who resurrects the dead. The working of the cross terminates our self that we may experience God in resurrection. The experience of the cross always issues in the enjoyment of the God of resurrection. Such experience produces and forms the ministry (vv. 4-6). This is further described in 4:7-12. ",
  "4738":"Referring to the immediate future (indicating continuity). ",
  "4739":"Or, work together. This must refer to the believers' coordinating with and rendering help in God's deliverance and the apostles' hope mentioned in the preceding verse. ",
  "4740":"Referring to the grace given (v. 12), the resurrected Christ Himself, who is the grace that the apostles enjoyed in the experience of resurrection out of death (vv. 9-10). This is the gift of grace, which is different from the gifts of abilities mentioned in 1 Cor. 12 and 14. The gift of grace is inward for life, and the gifts of abilities are outward for function. ",
  "4741":"Lit., faces; implying that thanks are given by cheerful countenances. ",
  "4742":"We must have a pure conscience (2 Tim. 1:3), a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16), that can bear a testimony to what we are and do. ",
  "4743":"Or, simplicity. Some MSS read, holiness. The apostles' situation of death forced them to be simple, that is, not to base their confidence on themselves or on their natural human ability to work out a solution to their difficult situation. This was the testimony of their conscience and was their confidence (v. 15). ",
  "4744":"A divine virtue, a virtue of what God is. To conduct ourselves in such a virtue means to experience God Himself. Hence, to conduct ourselves in such a virtue is to be in the grace of God (later in the verse). ",
  "4745":"I.e., human wisdom in the flesh. This equals ourselves, just as the grace of God equals God Himself. ",
  "4746":"God for our enjoyment (see note 10 in 1 Cor. 15). Grace here is the gift in v. 11, which the apostles received for the experience of resurrection in their sufferings. ",
  "4747":"See note 13 in 1 Cor. 3. ",
  "4748":"Lit., second; referring to the double grace bestowed by the apostle's coming to Corinth twice, once in this verse and again in the next verse. Through the apostle's coming, the grace of God, that is, the imparting of God as the life supply and spiritual enjoyment, was bestowed on the believers. His two comings would bring them a double portion of such grace. ",
  "4749":"A province of the Roman Empire, north of Achaia. The cities of Philippi and Thessalonica were in Macedonia. ",
  "4750":"But gives a contrast. In the preceding verse the apostle referred to the charge that he was a man of yes and no. In this verse he defended himself by saying that because God is faithful, the word of their preaching was not yes and no. Hence, they were not fickle persons of yes and no. Their being was according to their preaching. They lived according to what they preached. ",
  "4751":"The word of the apostles' preaching (1 Cor. 1:18), their message concerning Christ (v. 19). ",
  "4752":"For introduces the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. God is faithful, never changing, especially in His promises concerning Christ. Hence, the word the apostles preached concerning Christ was likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no. Rather, in Him is yes. Since the Christ whom they preached according to God's promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is. They preached Christ and lived Him. They were not men of yes and no but men who were the same as Christ. ",
  "4753":"I.e., Silas. See Acts 15:22; 18:5. ",
  "4754":"Again, for introduces the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. Christ, whom the faithful God promised and whom the sincere apostles preached, did not become yes and no, did not change, because in Him is the Yes of all the promises of God, and through Him is the apostles' and the believers' Amen to God for His glory. ",
  "4755":"Christ. ",
  "4756":"Christ is the Yes, the incarnate answer, the fulfillment of all the promises of God to us. ",
  "4757":"The Amen given by us through Christ to God (cf. 1 Cor. 14:16). Christ is the Yes, and we say Amen to this Yes before God. ",
  "4758":"When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes, the fulfillment, of all the promises of God, God is glorified through us. ",
  "4759":"Referring not only to the apostles, who preached Christ according to God's promises, but also to the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles' preaching. Through us there is glory unto God when we say Amen to Christ as the great Yes of all God's promises. ",
  "4760":"The apostles, who preached Christ according to God's promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles' preaching, are joined to Christ, becoming one with Him, through whom they say Amen before God to the great Yes of God's promises, which is Christ Himself. But it is not they but God who attaches them all together unto Christ. Their being one with Christ is of God and by God, not of themselves and by themselves. ",
  "4761":"Lit., establishes. God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God firmly attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. Hence, the apostles and the believers are one not only with Christ, the anointed One, but also with one another, sharing the anointing that Christ has received of God. ",
  "4762":"I.e., the apostles with the believers have been attached to Christ, the anointed One. This shows that the apostles ranked themselves with the believers in being attached to Christ by the anointing Spirit, not considering themselves a special group separate from the believers in God's all-inclusive salvation. ",
  "4763":"I.e., together with. ",
  "4764":"I.e., the anointed One (Dan. 9:26, lit.). ",
  "4765":"Since we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God. ",
  "4766":"The anointing in the preceding verse is the sealing. Since God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. See note 13 in Eph. 1. ",
  "4767":"The Spirit, the earnest of God as our portion, is a foretaste to us; thus, here it says that He is in our hearts. Romans 5:5 and Gal. 4:6 refer to the matter of love and, hence, speak of the Spirit in our heart. But Rom. 8:16 refers to the work of the Spirit, since it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. Our heart is a loving organ, but our spirit is a working one. ",
  "4768":"The seal is a mark that marks us out as God's inheritance, God's possession, as those who belong to God. The pledge is an earnest, guaranteeing that God is our inheritance, or possession, and belongs to us (see note 14 in Eph. 1). The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God as our portion in Christ. <br><br>   God's attaching us to Christ issues in three things: (1) an anointing that imparts God's elements into us; (2) a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image; and (3) a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. Through these three experiences of the anointing Spirit, with the experience of the cross, the ministry of Christ is produced. ",
  "4769":"Lit., upon. The apostle called on, or asked, God to be a witness against his soul, that is, against himself, should he speak falsely. ",
  "4770":"The apostle would not come to visit the Corinthian believers with a rod for discipline, but in love and a spirit of meekness for building (1 Cor. 4:21). In order to avoid any unpleasant feeling, he refrained from coming. He treated them leniently and would not come to them in sorrow (2:1). He did not like to lord it over their faith but wished to be a fellow worker with them for their joy (v. 24). This was the truth. He called on God to witness to this for him. ",
  "4771":"For the believers to stand in the objective faith (1 Cor. 16:13 and note 2), subjective faith is needed. Lording it over their subjective faith weakens it, but being a fellow worker with them for their joy strengthens it. ",
  "4772":"The same Greek word as for judged. ",
  "4773":"In the first Epistle. ",
  "4774":"I.e., apply pressure too heavily, press too heavily, say too much. The apostle said here that the offender caused in part all the church to sorrow. He said \"in part\" lest he press too heavily, lest he say too much. This indicates that he was a tender, cautious, and considerate person. ",
  "4775":"Or, deal graciously with. ",
  "4776":"I.e., formally prove by sure evidence. ",
  "4777":"Know your approvedness means put you to the test. ",
  "4778":"Or, tested character. ",
  "4779":"Or, deal graciously with. ",
  "4780":"Or, dealt graciously with. ",
  "4781":"Lit., face; as in 4:6. The part around the eyes; the look as the index of the inward thoughts and feelings, which shows forth and manifests the whole person. This indicates that the apostle was one who lived and acted in the presence of Christ, according to the index of His whole person, expressed in His eyes. The first section, 1:1--2:11, is a long introduction to this Epistle, which follows the apostle's first Epistle to the disorderly believers in Corinth. After receiving information that they had repented (7:6-13) through their accepting of his rebukes in the first Epistle, he was comforted and encouraged. Thus, he wrote this Epistle to comfort and encourage them in a very personal, tender, and affectionate way, in such a way that this Epistle can be considered to some extent his autobiography. In it we see a person who lived Christ according to what he wrote concerning Him in his first Epistle, in the closest and most intimate contact with Him, acting according to the index of His eyes; a person who was one with Christ, full of Christ, and saturated with Christ; a person who was broken and even terminated in his natural life, softened and flexible in his will, affectionate yet restricted in his emotion, considerate and sober in his mind, and pure and genuine in his spirit toward the believers for their benefit, that they might experience and enjoy Christ as he did for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose in the building up of Christ's Body. ",
  "4782":"This discloses that the evil one, Satan, is behind the scenes in everything and works in everything. ",
  "4783":"I.e., plans, plots, devices, designs, wiles, intentions, purposes. ",
  "4784":"In addition to what he mentioned in vv. 10-11, the apostle also told the Corinthian believers of his concern for them. Although in Troas a door had been opened to him, even in the Lord, he had no rest in his spirit when he did not find Titus, whom he was anxious to meet to gain information concerning the effect of his first Epistle among the Corinthians. Then he left Troas and went forth to Macedonia (v. 13), being anxious to meet Titus to obtain the information. This showed his great affection for the Corinthians. His concern for the church was much greater than his concern for the preaching of the gospel. ",
  "4785":"Or, by the Lord; i.e., not by human effort. ",
  "4786":"This indicates that the apostle was one who lived and acted in his spirit, as indicated in 1 Cor. 16:18. ",
  "4787":"This Epistle was written in Macedonia after Paul's stay in Ephesus on the third journey of his ministry (8:1; Acts 20:1). ",
  "4788":"\"The verb here used ... means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means, to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ. ... God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet (at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor) an incense-bearer, scattering incense (which was always done on these occasions) as the procession moves on. Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol; to them the smell of the incense was `an odor of death unto death'; to the rest who were spared, `an odor of life unto life' \" (Conybeare). (The same metaphor is used in Col. 2:15.) God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way for their ministry. <br><br>   In the second section of this Epistle, 2:12--7:16, the apostle spoke about his and his co-workers' ministry. He first likened their ministry to a celebration of Christ's victory. Their move in their ministry for Christ was like a triumphal procession going from one place to another under God's leading. He and his co-workers were Christ's captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ, for His triumphant glory. They had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, scattering the fragrance of Christ from place to place. This was their ministry for Him. ",
  "4789":"As conquered and captured captives in the train of Christ's triumph, celebrating and participating in Christ's triumph. The apostles were such captives; their move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him was God's celebration of Christ's victory over His enemies. ",
  "4790":"See note 5 in ch. 1. ",
  "4791":"\"According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle's work\" (Vincent). ",
  "4792":"As incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles were incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph. ",
  "4793":"The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ. They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who were being saved, as a savor out of life unto life, and in those who were perishing, as a savor out of death unto death. ",
  "4794":"I.e., resulting in death ... resulting in life. Referring to the effect of the apostles' ministry in two different aspects on different persons. It is a matter of life and death! Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this (3:5-6). ",
  "4795":"Or, competent, qualified, fit, worthy. The same Greek word as in 3:5. ",
  "4796":"The Greek word means retailing, hawking. Originally, it referred to the selling of inferior items at high prices in a tricky way by peddlers who were of low class. Many engaged in this kind of hawking, adulterating the word of God for their profit, but the apostles did not. Out of sincerity and out of God in their ministry, they spoke in Christ the word of God in the sight of God. How sincere and genuine were the apostles in their ministry! ",
  "4797":"I.e., minister the word of God. ",
  "4798":"The believers were the fruit of the apostles' labor, commending the apostles and their ministry to others. Thus, they became the apostles' living letter of commendation, written by the apostles with the indwelling Christ as the content in every part of their inner being. ",
  "4799":"The Corinthian believers, as the apostles' living letter of commendation, were inscribed in the apostles' hearts; thus, they were carried by the apostles and could not possibly be severed from the apostles. They were in the apostles' hearts (7:3), brought by them everywhere as their living commendation. ",
  "4800":"A letter of Christ is written with Christ as the content to convey and express Christ. All Christ's believers should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their beings. ",
  "4801":"I.e., written by the ministry of the apostles. The apostles were filled with Christ, so that their ministry spontaneously ministered Christ to those whom they contacted, inscribing Christ in their hearts and making them living letters that conveyed Christ. That the letters were inscribed both in the apostles' hearts (v. 2) and in the believers' hearts (v. 3) shows that the proper new covenant ministry, described in this book, always writes something both in the hearts of those who receive the ministry and in the hearts of those who minister. This kind of ministry is in the way of life, with the life-giving Spirit as the essence of the writing (see v. 6 and note 3). ",
  "4802":"The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not the instrument, like a pen, but the element, like ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. ",
  "4803":"Our heart, composed of our conscience (the leading part of our spirit), our mind, our emotion, and our will, is the tablet in which the living letters of Christ are written with the living Spirit of God. This implies that Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters, that He may be expressed and read by others in us. ",
  "4804":"See note 16 in ch. 2. ",
  "4805":"Or, reckon, evaluate. ",
  "4806":"Or, competency, qualification. The living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles' ministry for God's New Testament economy, which is to dispense Christ into God's chosen people for the building up of Christ's Body. ",
  "4807":"The written code of the law. ",
  "4808":"The Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles ministered Christ into the believers to make them the living letters of Christ (v. 3). Unlike the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament, the apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters but of the living Spirit, who gives life. ",
  "4809":"The letter of the law, which only requires of man. It is unable to supply man with life (Gal. 3:21). Because of man's inability to fulfill the requirements of the law, the law kills man (Rom. 7:9-11). ",
  "4810":"The Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, who became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and the apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life. Hence, their ministry is one constituted with the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit. ",
  "4811":"The ministry of the old covenant, a covenant of the dead letter, which kills. ",
  "4812":"The glory that shone temporarily and only on Moses' face (Exo. 34:29, 35). ",
  "4813":"The apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life. ",
  "4814":"The glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles (4:6), surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10). ",
  "4815":"The ministry of the old covenant became one of death (v. 7) because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20-21). Hence, it was also the ministry of condemnation. ",
  "4816":"The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit who gives life (vv. 8, 6), because the new covenant brings in God's righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:18, 21). Hence, it is also the ministry of righteousness, the ministry of justification. The focus of the ministry of the new covenant is thus both the Spirit as the life supply, and righteousness, the living out and genuine expression of Christ (the image of God), who as the Spirit is our life (v. 17). ",
  "4817":"The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory but also abounds with the glory of God, which surpasses the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10). ",
  "4818":"Temporarily in the shining of Moses' face. ",
  "4819":"I.e., in the fact that the glory of the ministry of the law was a temporary glory shining on Moses' face. In this respect it was being done away with on account of the surpassing glory. Because of the glory of the new covenant ministry (which is the glory of God, even God Himself, manifested in the face of Christ forever, surpassing the temporary glory of the old covenant ministry, which was shining on Moses' face), the temporary glory of the ministry of the law disappeared and no longer exists. ",
  "4820":"I.e., was being done away with (v. 7). ",
  "4821":"I.e., in the process of being abolished through the spreading of the new covenant ministry. ",
  "4822":"Verses 7-11 show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of the law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit. The former was through glory in a temporary way; the latter remains in glory forever. <br><br>   In 2:12-17 the apostle spoke of the triumph and effect of the apostolic ministry. In vv. 1-6 of this chapter he spoke of its function and competency, and in vv. 7-11, of its glory and superiority. ",
  "4823":"I.e., the hope that the shining glory of the new covenant ministry will remain forever. The apostles' having hope was in contrast to Moses' lacking hope because of the fading glory of his old covenant ministry of the law, which was being done away with (v. 13). ",
  "4824":"The Greek word implies speaking. In contrast to Moses, who covered his face with a veil (v. 13), the apostles had the boldness to speak openly and freely concerning their ministry, not hiding, not dissembling. ",
  "4825":"While Moses spoke the word of God to the sons of Israel, he kept his glorified face unveiled. But after speaking, he veiled his face (Exo. 34:29-33) lest they see the end of his ministry, which was passing away. He did not want them to behold the termination of his ministry of the law, which was being done away with. ",
  "4826":"\"Originally, things which proceed out of the mind. ... Phil. 4:7... 2 Cor. 2:11. Hence, derivatively, the minds themselves\" (Vincent). ",
  "4827":"It refers to the fact that the veil is being done away with in Christ. Since this fact had not been unveiled to the sons of Israel, their thoughts were hardened and their minds were blinded. The veil is being done away with in Christ through the new covenant economy, yet it still remains on their heart when they read the old covenant (v. 15). ",
  "4828":"Referring to Moses' writings, the Pentateuch (John 5:47). ",
  "4829":"This indicates that when their heart is away from the Lord, the veil lies on their heart. When their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Actually, their turned-away heart is the veil. To turn their heart to the Lord is to take away the veil. ",
  "4830":"Or, furthermore, in addition. When the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. In addition to this, furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit, who would give us freedom. Since the Lord is the Spirit, when the heart turns to Him, the veil is taken away and the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law. ",
  "4831":"According to the context of this section, which begins at 2:12, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord (2:12, 14-15, 17; 3:3-4, 14, 16; 4:5). This then is a strong word in the Bible, telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit. \"The Lord Christ of v. 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (v. 6), and the ministration of which is with glory (v. 8). Compare Rom. 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18\" (Vincent). \"The Lord of v. 16, is the Spirit ... which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, `the Lord,' as here spoken of, `Christ,' `is the Spirit,' is identical with the Holy Spirit ... Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ\" (Alford). \"All that transforming and indwelling Spirit is Christ Himself. `The Lord is the Spirit' \" (Williston Walker). ",
  "4832":"The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God, was not yet in John 7:39, because at that time Jesus had not yet been glorified. He had not yet finished the process that He, as the embodiment of God, had to pass through. After His resurrection, that is, after the finishing of all the processes, such as incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, that the Triune God had to pass through in man for His redemptive economy, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). In the New Testament, this life-giving Spirit is called \"the Spirit\" (Rom. 8:16, 23, 26-27; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14; 6:8; Rev. 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17), the Spirit who gives us the divine life (v. 6; John 6:63) and frees us from the bondage of the law. ",
  "4833":"The Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, with whom is freedom. ",
  "4834":"Freedom from the letter of the law under the veil (Gal. 2:4; 5:1). ",
  "4835":"But indicates that we believers are different from the children of Israel. They were veiled, but we with unveiled face behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the Lord and are thus being transformed into the same image as the Lord from glory to glory. ",
  "4836":"The apostles, who, as the examples and representatives of all believers, are the ministers of Christ. In vv. 8-9 the glory is related to the ministry of the new covenant. Here the glory is related to the apostles, the ministers of the new covenant. This shows that the ministry of the new covenant is not merely an activity carried out by the new covenant ministers; rather, it is what the new covenant ministers are. They are one with their ministry, for the same invisible glory saturates and pervades both their work and their being, so that there is no difference between the two. ",
  "4837":"In contrast to the veiled mind, the veiled heart (vv. 14-15). That our face is unveiled means that our heart has turned to the Lord, so that the veil has been taken away, and the Lord as the Spirit has freed us from the bondage, the veiling, of the law, so that there is no more insulation between us and the Lord. ",
  "4838":"To behold the glory of the Lord is to see the Lord ourselves; to reflect the glory of the Lord is to enable others to see Him through us. ",
  "4839":"We are like mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. This being the case, our face should be fully unveiled that we may see well and reflect properly. ",
  "4840":"I.e., the glory of the Lord, the resurrected and ascended One, who as both God and man passed through incarnation, human living on the earth, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, accomplished full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, He dwells in us to make Himself and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us, that we may be one with Him and be transformed into the same image as the Lord from glory to glory. ",
  "4841":"When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. Thus we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence; that is, we are being transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation. ",
  "4842":"The image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29). ",
  "4843":"I.e., from one degree of glory to another. This indicates an ongoing process in life in resurrection. ",
  "4844":"From indicates that the transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him. ",
  "4845":"The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. Again, this expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. In this chapter, this Spirit is revealed as the inscribing Spirit (v. 3), the Spirit who gives life (v. 6), the ministering Spirit (v. 8), the freeing Spirit (v. 17), and the transforming Spirit (v. 18). Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God's new covenant economy. <br><br>   After speaking about the ministry of the new covenant, the apostle spoke about the ministers of the new covenant. From v. 12 through v. 18 he depicted the new covenant ministers as persons whose hearts have turned to the Lord, whose faces are unveiled, who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit, freeing them from the bondage of the law, and who are being transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding and reflecting Him. Through such a process of transformation they are constituted ministers of Christ by the Spirit with the elements of Christ's person and work. Hence, their person is constituted of and with Christ, and their ministry is to minister Christ to others, infusing them with the all-inclusive Christ as the indwelling, life-giving Spirit. All believers should imitate such ministers to be the same kind of person and to accomplish the same kind of ministry. ",
  "4846":"In 3:12-18 the apostle depicted how the ministers of the new covenant are constituted. In this chapter, from v. 1 through v. 6 he went on to tell how they as the ministers of the new covenant conducted themselves for the carrying out of their ministry; from v. 7 through v. 18 he described the kind of life they lived, a life that made them one with their ministry. This chapter mentions several aspects of their experience that correspond with and confirm what was spoken in ch. 3 concerning the ministry of the new covenant: (1) the peace the apostle experienced as a result of the manifestation of life in the midst of turmoil in vv. 8-9 corresponds with the righteousness as the fruit of peace (James 3:18), i.e., the expression of the image of God in a proper and orderly way, mentioned in 3:9; (2) the life in vv. 10-12 corresponds with the Spirit in 3:6, 8, 17-18; (3) being renewed in v. 16 corresponds with being transformed in 3:18; and (4) the eternal weight of glory in v. 17 corresponds with the degrees of glory in 3:18. ",
  "4847":"The ministry described in 2:12--3:18, that is, the unique ministry common to all the apostles of Christ. Although they are many, they have only one ministry &#151; the ministry of the new covenant for the accomplishing of God's New Testament economy. All the apostles' works are to carry out this unique ministry, the ministering of Christ to people for the building up of His Body. ",
  "4848":"See note 13 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "4849":"The original meaning of the Greek word was to ensnare; later, to corrupt, as in the adulterating of gold or wine. The meaning is narrower than adulterating in 2:17, which adds the sense for gain's sake. ",
  "4850":"The truth is another expression for the word of God (John 17:17 and notes). It means the reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God's word, which are mainly Christ as the reality of all the things of God. The manifestation of the truth refers to the apostles' living of Christ. When they lived Christ, who is the truth (John 14:6), they manifested the truth. As Christ was lived out of them, the truth was manifested in them. By this, they commended themselves to every conscience of men before God. The apostles behaved themselves not in the way of adulterating the word of God but in the way of manifesting the truth for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ, by the excellent power of the priceless treasure, the very Christ who entered into them and became their content (v. 7) through the enlightenment of God's shining (v. 6). ",
  "4851":"Veiled by old concepts, especially the concept concerning the law (3:14-15). In principle, anything such as philosophy, religion, or cultural traditions that hinders people from apprehending the gospel of Christ is a veil. Hence, the preaching of Christ must unveil them, just as in photography the cover is removed from the lens that it might take in the view. ",
  "4852":"Satan, the deceiver, the ruler of the present age, who dominates today's world and hunts for man's worship by blinding his mind and his thoughts. ",
  "4853":"I.e., has veiled men's understanding. ",
  "4854":"Or, minds. See note 14 in ch. 3. ",
  "4855":"Christ as the image of God is the effulgence of His glory (Heb. 1:3). Hence, the gospel of Christ is the gospel of His glory that illuminates and shines forth. Satan, the god of this age, has blinded the thoughts and the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the gospel of Christ's glory might not shine into their hearts. This is similar to a camera lens's being covered so that the light cannot shine into the camera to bring in the image. It is also like a blind man, or a man with his eyes veiled, into whom the light of the sun is unable to shine. ",
  "4856":"The Greek word means (1) to see distinctly, to discern, and (2) to shine. ",
  "4857":"This explains why the apostles' gospel, which is the gospel of the glory of Christ, should not have been veiled: they did not preach, exalt, themselves but Christ Jesus as Lord of all, and they conducted themselves as the believers' slaves for Jesus' sake. ",
  "4858":"Christ Jesus as Lord comprises Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever (Rom. 9:5), the eternal Word incarnated to be a man (John 1:14), Jesus crucified as a man to be our Savior (Acts 4:10-12) and resurrected to be the Son of God (Acts 13:33), and Christ exalted to be the Lord (Acts 2:36), even the Lord of all men (Acts 10:36; Rom. 10:12; John 20:28; 1 Cor. 12:3), who is the image of God, the effulgence of God's glory (Heb. 1:3). This is the very content of the gospel. Hence, the gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in the heart of man (v. 6). If man's heart is not veiled with anything or blinded by Satan, the god of this age, man can see the illumination of the gospel (v. 4). ",
  "4859":"In contrast to Lord. The apostles exalted Christ as Lord but considered themselves merely slaves to serve the believers. ",
  "4860":"This explains what is mentioned in the preceding verse. The apostles preached Christ as Lord and themselves as the believers' slaves because the very God who commanded light to shine out of darkness had shined in their hearts. His shining in the universe produced the old creation. Now His shining in their hearts made them a new creation. Therefore, in their preaching they were able to exalt Christ as the Lord, and in their ministry, to conduct themselves as slaves of the believers. What they did for Christ and what they were to the believers were the issue of God's shining. God's shining produces the new covenant ministers and their ministry. ",
  "4861":"In our hearts is much deeper than on the skin of Moses' face (3:7; Exo. 34:29-30). This presents a comparison between the glory of the apostolic ministry of the gospel and that of the Mosaic ministry of the law. In the heart is related to the inner life, whereas on the skin of the face has nothing to do with the inner life. The glory of the old covenant is on the surface, but the glory of the new covenant has great depth. ",
  "4862":"The apostles' hearts. The apostles represent all the believers of the new covenant. ",
  "4863":"The illumination here, which refers to the shining of God's light on others out from those whose hearts have been enlightened by God, corresponds with the manifestation in v. 2 and is the same as the shining in Matt. 5:16 and Phil. 2:15. God shines in our hearts that we may shine on others so that they may have the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, that is, the knowledge of Christ, who expresses and declares God (John 1:18). ",
  "4864":"The face of Jesus Christ is in comparison with the face of Moses (3:7). The glory of the gospel in the face of Jesus Christ is much superior to the glory of the law in the face of Moses. The former shines in the face of One through whom grace and reality came, issuing in righteousness and the Spirit &#151; life (3:8-9); the latter shone in the face of one through whom the law was given (John 1:17), resulting in condemnation and death (3:7, 9). The shining of God in our hearts is to illumine us that we may know not the glory on Moses' face but the glory in Christ's face; it is to enlighten us that we may know not the law of Moses of the old covenant but the gospel of Christ of the new covenant. The glory of God manifested in the face of Jesus Christ is the God of glory expressed through Jesus Christ, and it is Jesus Christ, who is the effulgence of the glory of God (Heb. 1:3); to know Him is to know the God of glory. ",
  "4865":"God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels! This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry. This has been accomplished by the divine power in resurrection. The excellency of the power is surely of God and not out of us. <br><br>   In the apostles' speaking concerning their ministry for God's new covenant, five very significant and expressive metaphors were used to illustrate how they, as the ministers of the new covenant, and their ministry were constituted, how they behaved and lived, and how their ministry was carried out: <br><br>   (1) Captives in a triumphal procession for the celebration of Christ's victory (2:14a); <br><br>   (2) Incense-bearers to scatter the fragrance of Christ (2:14b-16); <br><br>   (3) Letters written with Christ as the content (3:1-3); <br><br>   (4) Mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image (3:18); <br><br>   (5) Earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure (v. 7). These vessels are like today's camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God's shining (vv. 4, 6). ",
  "4866":"This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life. It is by the excellent power of this treasure that the apostles as the ministers of the new covenant were capable of living a crucified life that the resurrection life of Christ, whom they ministered, might be manifested. Thus, they manifested the truth (v. 2) for the shining of the gospel. ",
  "4867":"Or, transcendence, surpassing greatness, exceeding greatness. ",
  "4868":"Or, afflicted. The description of their life, from this verse through v. 18, shows that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection, or lived the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry. ",
  "4869":"Or, restricted. ",
  "4870":"Or, pursued (by enemies). ",
  "4871":"Or, deserted, forsaken; lit., left behind (in some terrible plight). ",
  "4872":"Or, struck down. ",
  "4873":"I.e., killed. The same Greek word as for perishing in v. 3. ",
  "4874":"I.e., the killing, the deadening; referring to the working of death, the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and went through. In our experience this is a kind of suffering, persecution, or dealing that comes upon us for the sake of Jesus, for the sake of the Body of Christ, and for the sake of the new covenant ministry. This does not refer to sufferings and troubles that are common to all human beings in the old creation, such as illness or calamity, or to punishment, correction, or discipline suffered because of sins, mistakes, or failure to fulfill one's responsibility. This putting to death of Jesus consumes our natural man, our outward man, our flesh, so that our inward man may have the opportunity to develop and be renewed (v. 16). ",
  "4875":"In order that, with the result that. The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life. This daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection. ",
  "4876":"The resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross. ",
  "4877":"The title Jesus in these two verses implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth. The Lord's life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry (John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24). ",
  "4878":"The use of flesh and body interchangeably in vv. 10 and 11 indicates that our mortal flesh is our fallen body. ",
  "4879":"When we are under the killing of the Lord's death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others. The impartation of life into others is always the issue of our suffering the killing of the cross. ",
  "4880":"The same spirit as set forth in the words quoted later in this verse. ",
  "4881":"\"Not distinctly the Holy Spirit, &#151; but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man\" (Alford). \"Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both\" (Vincent). The spirit of faith is the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit. We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, like the psalmist, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. Here spirit indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry. ",
  "4882":"This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons (1:9), for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord's purpose (v. 11). ",
  "4883":"Grace, according to the context, is the very Christ, who lived in the apostles as their life and life supply for them to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life that they might carry out their ministry for God's new covenant. See note 10 in 1 Cor. 15. ",
  "4884":"The outer man consists of the body as its organ with the soul as its life and person. The inner man consists of the regenerated spirit as its life and person with the renewed soul as its organ. The life of the soul must be denied (Matt. 16:24-25), but the faculties of the soul &#151; the mind, will, and emotion &#151; must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (10:4-5) so that they can be used by the spirit, the person of the inner man. ",
  "4885":"Or, being consumed, being wasted away, being worn out. By the continued killing, the working of death, our outer man, that is, our material body with its animating soul (1 Cor. 15:44 and note), is being consumed and worn out. ",
  "4886":"By being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life. As our mortal body, our outer man, is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 7:22, 25), is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of the resurrection life. ",
  "4887":"Referring to the putting to death, the working of the cross (v. 10). ",
  "4888":"Lit., excessively unto excess. ",
  "4889":"In contrast to momentary lightness. ",
  "4890":"The expression of God as resurrection life. Glory is in contrast to affliction. ",
  "4891":"Things of the temporary affliction. ",
  "4892":"Things of the eternal glory. ",
  "4893":"For indicates that what is to be mentioned is an explanation of what was spoken in 4:13-18. In this chapter the apostle tells us of the apostles' aspiration for the redemption of their bodies (vv. 1-8; Rom. 8:23), their ambition, their determination, to please the Lord (vv. 9-15), and their commission from the Lord for His new creation (vv. 16-21). ",
  "4894":"Not made of earth but on the earth. ",
  "4895":"I.e., our physical body, in which our person dwells and which is not only for our living but also for our worshipping God (cf. 1 Cor. 6:19). ",
  "4896":"A building with a foundation, in contrast to the tabernacle, which had no foundation. This building is our resurrected, transfigured body, the spiritual body mentioned in 1 Cor. 15, and is in contrast to the dying, physical, natural body that we have today. ",
  "4897":"Lit., out of. ",
  "4898":"Our spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:44). ",
  "4899":"In contrast to earthly, i.e., on the earth. ",
  "4900":"Referring to tabernacle in v. 1. ",
  "4901":"I.e., to have our body transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ's glory. The apostles were longing for this. ",
  "4902":"Referring to the dwelling in the heavens in the preceding verse. ",
  "4903":"Lit., out of. ",
  "4904":"I.e., without a body. A dead person, being disembodied, is naked, without a body as a covering before God. The apostles were expecting to be transfigured in their bodies, to be clothed with a spiritual body to meet the Lord before they died and were disembodied, that they might not be found naked. ",
  "4905":"I.e., Weighed down, depressed, oppressed. ",
  "4906":"The apostles groaned in the desire not to be unclothed, disembodied, that is, in the desire not to die but to be clothed, to put on the spiritual body, that is, to have their body transfigured (Phil. 3:21), to have their body redeemed (Rom. 8:23). ",
  "4907":"Our mortal body (4:11; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:53). ",
  "4908":"The death in our mortal body is swallowed up by resurrection life. Through this our body will be transfigured (1 Cor. 15:54). ",
  "4909":"Or, fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. God has wrought us, fashioned us, shaped us, prepared us, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body might be swallowed up by His resurrection life. Thus our entire being will be saturated with Christ. God has given us the Spirit as the pledge, the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee, of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation, which He has prepared for us in Christ. ",
  "4910":"See note 22 in ch. 1. ",
  "4911":"Our body is in the material realm; the Lord is in the spiritual realm. In this sense we are abroad from the Lord when we are at home in our body. ",
  "4912":"The apostles regulated their lives and conducted themselves by faith, as mentioned in Heb. 11, not by that which was seen. It was in this way that they realized they were away from the Lord while they were in their physical body. This corresponds with the word in 4:18. ",
  "4913":"I.e., that which is seen; hence, sight. ",
  "4914":"I.e., to die, thus being released from the material realm to be with the Lord in the spiritual realm. The apostles, who were always being persecuted unto death (1:8-9; 4:11; 11:23; 1 Cor. 15:31), were well pleased rather to die that they might be released from their confining body to be at home with the Lord in a better realm (Phil. 1:23). ",
  "4915":"Zealous with a strong aim, striving earnestly to be well pleasing to the Lord. ",
  "4916":"I.e., living and thus remaining in the body, or dying and thus being with the Lord. ",
  "4917":"For points to the reason for the determination mentioned in v. 9. ",
  "4918":"Where Christ will judge His believers at His coming back, not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15). See note 10 in Rom. 14. ",
  "4919":"\"The technical word for receiving wages\" (Alford). ",
  "4920":"While we are still at home in the body, we should do things through it to please the Lord that we may be rewarded by the Lord at His coming. ",
  "4921":"Or, worthless. ",
  "4922":"I.e., being conscious of fearing the Lord. Therefore indicates that this consciousness is due to the judgment seat of Christ mentioned in v. 10. ",
  "4923":"Not the Lord's being fearsome but our fearing the Lord. ",
  "4924":"The apostles, conscious of fearing the Lord, persuaded men concerning their integrity, concerning what kind of persons they were, toward both God and men. They did not need to persuade God, for what they were had already been made manifest to God; yet, the apostles hoped that they had been made manifest also in the believers' consciences. ",
  "4925":"I.e., have words to answer those who are boasting. ",
  "4926":"Lit., face. The outward appearance of the Judaizers. ",
  "4927":"Where the sincerity and reality of the virtues are. ",
  "4928":"I.e., mad, as a fool, for God's glory (Acts 26:24-25). The apostles' ecstasy was not an excitement out of folly, but it was to God and with God for His glory. ",
  "4929":"Self-controlled in love for others' good. ",
  "4930":"The love of Christ toward us, which was manifested on the cross through His dying for us (Gal. 2:20). ",
  "4931":"The Greek word means to press on ... from all sides, to hold ... to one end, to forcibly limit, to confine to one object within certain bounds, to shut up to one line and purpose (as in a narrow, walled road). (The same Greek word is used in Luke 4:38; 12:50; Acts 18:5; Phil. 1:23.) In such a way the apostles were constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him. ",
  "4932":"I.e., have concluded (probably at the time of conversion). ",
  "4933":"Christ's loving death is the motivating factor in the apostles' being constrained to live a loving life for Him. ",
  "4934":"Since Christ died as our Substitute, suffering the sentence of death on behalf of us all, in the eyes of God we all died. Hence, we do not need to die as has been reserved for men (Heb. 9:27). ",
  "4935":"Christ's death not only saves us from death so that we do not need to die, but also causes us, through His resurrection, to live no longer to ourselves but to Him. ",
  "4936":"Living to the Lord is deeper in significance than living for the Lord. Living for the Lord implies that I and the Lord are still two; living to the Lord indicates that I am one with the Lord, as the wife is one with the husband in married life. ",
  "4937":"Since the apostles judged that Christ's death made us all, through His resurrection, a new man, a man not according to the flesh, they would no longer know anyone according to the flesh. They had known Christ in that way, but now they knew Him so no longer. ",
  "4938":"The first know refers to the inward, subjective consciousness; known and the second know refer to the outward, objective knowledge. See note 6 in Rom. 6. ",
  "4939":"This confirms what is mentioned in the preceding verse. The apostles would no longer know anyone according to the flesh, because anyone who is in Christ is a new creation; the old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection. ",
  "4940":"To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature. This is of God through our faith in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28). ",
  "4941":"The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, constituted of the believers, who are born again of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Hence, the believers are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life. ",
  "4942":"Or, ancient. ",
  "4943":"A call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation. ",
  "4944":"Referring to the old things. ",
  "4945":"Referring to all the positive things mentioned in vv. 14-21, of which God is the Originator and Initiator. It is of God that Christ died to save us from death that we might live to Him. It is of God that we have become a new creation in Christ. It is of God that Christ was made sin for us that we might become God's righteousness in Him. It is of God that He reconciled the world to Himself. And it is of God that the apostles are made ambassadors of Christ, commissioned to represent Him for the reconciling of men to God, that men may become God's righteousness and a new creation for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. ",
  "4946":"The word is for the ministry (v. 18). ",
  "4947":"The apostles were commissioned with a definite ministry, to represent Christ to accomplish God's purpose. ",
  "4948":"In the preceding verse it was the world that was reconciled to God; in this verse it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God and are to be reconciled further to God. This clearly indicates that two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ's death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us &#151; the persons &#151; that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (vv. 14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ's death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God's chosen people to God. These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called \"the screen\" (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet they still lived in the flesh. They needed to pass the second veil, which had been rent already (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The goal of this Epistle was to bring them there that they might be persons in the spirit (1 Cor. 2:15), in the Holy of Holies. This was what the apostle meant by saying, \"Be reconciled to God.\" This was to present them full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28). ",
  "4949":"Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience (cf. John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15; 7:26). ",
  "4950":"Sin came from Satan, who rebelled against God (Isa. 14:12-14). This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man (Rom. 5:12) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3) that we might become God's righteousness in Him. ",
  "4951":"Righteousness issues from God for His administration (Psa. 89:14; 97:2; Isa. 32:1). This righteousness is Christ to be our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30), making us God's righteousness in Him (not making us righteous before God). Through Christ's redemption, man, who is a sinner and is even sin, is made God's righteousness, being reconciled to the righteous God, and is made a new creation living to God for His eternal purpose. The apostles are commissioned to minister such a Christ, with all the glorious issues of His marvelous achievement, to His believers, who are the members that form His Body. Praise and glory be to Him forever! ",
  "4952":"In union with Him, not only positionally but also organically in resurrection. We were enemies of God (Col. 1:21) by becoming sin, which came from Satan, who rebelled against God. Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh. Through His death He was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God's righteousness. By this righteousness we, the enemies of God, could be and have been reconciled to God (vv. 18-20; Rom. 5:10). ",
  "4953":"And here indicates a continuation. In the last part of ch. 5 (5:16-21) the apostle told us that they, the ministers of the new covenant, had been commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation for the Lord's new creation. From this verse to the end of ch. 7 he continued by telling us how they worked. They worked together with God by a life (not by any gift) that was all-sufficient and all-mature, able to fit all situations, that is, able to endure any kind of treatment, to accept any kind of environment, to work in any kind of condition, and to take any kind of opportunity, for the carrying out of their ministry. ",
  "4954":"The apostles not only were commissioned by God with their ministry but also were working together with Him. They were God's co-workers (1 Cor. 3:9). ",
  "4955":"This is the work of reconciliation, as mentioned in 5:20. ",
  "4956":"See note 10 in 1 Cor. 15. The grace of God always brings us back to Him. Not to receive the grace of God in vain, according to the context, means not to remain in any condition that is a distraction from God, but to be brought back to Him. ",
  "4957":"This refers to the time of our being reconciled to God, when He well accepts us. ",
  "4958":"Referring to reconciliation, according to the context, which is continued from the end of ch. 5. ",
  "4959":"From here to the end of ch. 7 the apostle depicted a life that was all-fitting for the carrying out of their ministry. ",
  "4960":"The ministry of the new covenant (3:8-9; 4:1). ",
  "4961":"Endurance is the first qualification for the all-fitting life of the new covenant ministers. This refers not merely to a kind of patience but to the ability to endure suffering in tribulation, whether pressure, oppression, persecution, poverty, or any kind of trial. ",
  "4962":"The Greek word denotes constraints, urgent needs that press heavily, indicating a shortage of daily necessities such as food, lodging, or clothing. ",
  "4963":"I.e., sleeplessnesses, as occurred in Acts 16:25; 20:7-11, 31; and 2 Thes. 3:8. ",
  "4964":"Because of the lack of food. See note 27 in ch. 11. ",
  "4965":"Knowledge is a matter of the mind; love, a matter of the heart. ",
  "4966":"Referring to the apostles' regenerated spirit. With stripes on the body (v. 5), knowledge in the mind, and love in the heart, the entire being of the apostles, including body, soul, and spirit, was exercised in their living for the carrying out of their ministry. ",
  "4967":"This indicates that the apostles' life for their ministry was a life in the battle, fighting for God's kingdom. Weapons of righteousness are used for fighting that we may be right with God and men according to the righteousness of God (Matt. 6:33; 5:6, 10, 20). ",
  "4968":"Weapons on the right hand, such as the sword, are offensive; those on the left hand, such as the shield, are defensive. ",
  "4969":"Glory is from God and those who love Him; dishonor is from the devil and those who follow him. ",
  "4970":"An evil report comes from the opposers and persecutors (Matt. 5:11); a good report comes from the believers and those who receive the truth preached and taught by the apostles. ",
  "4971":"As deceivers in the eyes of the Judaizers and the people of other religions and philosophies, but true in the eyes of those who love the truth of God. ",
  "4972":"As unknown in the sense of not displaying themselves, but well known in the sense of witnessing to the truth of God. ",
  "4973":"As dying in suffering persecutions (1:8-10; 4:11; 1 Cor. 15:31), but living in the Lord's resurrection (4:10-11). ",
  "4974":"As being disciplined in the opposers' superficial realization, but not being put to death in the sovereign care of the Lord. ",
  "4975":"As made sorrowful by the negative conditions of the churches (11:28), yet always rejoicing in the sufficient grace and resurrection life of Christ (12:9-10). ",
  "4976":"As poor in material things, yet enriching many in spiritual riches (Eph. 3:8). ",
  "4977":"As having nothing in a human way, but possessing all things in the divine economy. ",
  "4978":"The apostles, all-mature and all-fitting, as depicted in vv. 3-10, had their mouths opened and their hearts enlarged to the believers. With an enlarged heart they were able to embrace all believers regardless of their condition, and with an opened mouth they were free to speak to all believers frankly concerning the real situation into which they had been misled. This kind of openness and enlargement is needed to reconcile, to bring back, the misled or distracted believers to God. ",
  "4979":"The Corinthian believers, being childish (v. 13), were constricted, contracted, in their inward parts toward the apostles. All children are very narrow in their affection and easily offended by those who correct them. ",
  "4980":"The same Greek word as for affections in 7:15. See note 8 in Phil. 1. ",
  "4981":"The apostle wanted the Corinthian believers to give him a recompense &#151; the same kind of enlarged heart, that they might receive him in their love. ",
  "4982":"This indicates (1) that the apostle considered the Corinthian believers childish, and (2) that in dealing with them he spoke as a father to his children. ",
  "4983":"To be enlarged requires growth and maturity in life, which the Corinthian believers lacked (1 Cor. 3:1, 6; 14:20). The apostle was laboring on them to make up the shortage. According to the context, which is continued from the end of ch. 5, to be enlarged by growing and maturing in life is equivalent to being fully reconciled to God. Writing in this way, the apostle was carrying out his ministry of reconciling the believers, who were but halfway in being reconciled to God. ",
  "4984":"This word was spoken by the apostle based on his mouth being opened and his heart being enlarged to the believers in v. 11. ",
  "4985":"Dissimilarly means diversely, implying a difference in kind. This refers to Deut. 22:10, which forbids the yoking together of two dissimilar animals. Believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples. Because of their divine nature and holy standing, the believers should not be yoked together with the unbelievers. This should be applied to all intimate relationships between believers and unbelievers, not only to marriage and business. <br><br>   This word indicates that the Corinthian believers were dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, not separated unto God from worldly people. This means that they were not fully reconciled to God. Hence, the apostle exhorted them not to be dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers but to be separated that they might be fully reconciled, brought back, to God. ",
  "4986":"The apostle used five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: (1) no partnership, no sharing together, between righteousness and lawlessness; (2) no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; (3) no concord, no harmony, between Christ and Belial; (4) no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and (5) no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols. These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial (Satan, the devil), and idols. ",
  "4987":"Lit., toward. ",
  "4988":"Lit., toward. ",
  "4989":"As the living God, God dwells among us and walks among us to be our God in a subjective way that we may partake of Him (see note 15 in 1 Tim. 3) and be His people, experiencing Him in a living way. ",
  "4990":"This is to be brought back, to be reconciled, to God in a practical way (5:20). To be brought back to God, to be reconciled to God, in a practical way requires us to be separated from all persons, things, and matters that do not belong to God. ",
  "4991":"Things that belong to lawlessness, darkness, Belial, and idols, as listed in vv. 14-16. ",
  "4992":"This is God's glad receiving of the believers who are brought back, fully reconciled, to Him. ",
  "4993":"God's being a Father to us and our being sons and daughters to Him are matters of life. They are deeper than His being our God and our being His people (v. 16). ",
  "4994":"This is the only instance in which the New Testament indicates that God has daughters. For the most part it tells us that the believers are sons of God. ",
  "4995":"This indicates that this verse is a conclusion to the last part of ch. 6, vv. 14-18. ",
  "4996":"The promises mentioned in 6:16-18. ",
  "4997":"Defilement of flesh is related to being defiled by material things; defilement of spirit, to being defiled by things in the spiritual world, such as idols. ",
  "4998":"Holiness is separation unto God from all things other than Him (see notes 2 in Rom. 1 and 4 in Eph. 1). To perfect holiness is to make this separation full and perfect, to have our entire being &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; fully and perfectly separated, sanctified, unto God (1 Thes. 5:23). This is to be fully reconciled to God. ",
  "4999":"Not daring to touch things that do not belong to God or are not related to Him (6:17). ",
  "5000":"The frank exhortation from 6:14--7:1 is given parenthetically to bring the distracted believers back to their holy God from their touching of defiling things that they might be fully reconciled to Him. Hence, this verse is actually a continuation of 6:11-13, entreating the believers to have their heart enlarged toward the apostles, to make room for the apostles. From this verse to the end of this chapter, the apostle in his entreating expressed his intimate concern for the believers, that they might be consoled and encouraged to go on positively with the Lord after being fully reconciled to Him. ",
  "5001":"First, have wronged no one; then, have corrupted no one; and last, have taken advantage of no one. ",
  "5002":"The expression of an intimate relationship. ",
  "5003":"Lit., the comfort, the joy; pointing to the particular comfort, the particular joy, brought by Titus. ",
  "5004":"Referring to the outer man, which includes the body and the soul (see note 16 in ch. 4) &#151; the fightings without and the fears within involve the body and the soul. Having no rest in the flesh differs from having no rest in the spirit (2:13). ",
  "5005":"Lit., humble; derivatively, downcast (because of oppressive circumstances). ",
  "5006":"Because of his deep concern for the Corinthian believers' response to his first Epistle, the apostle, having had no rest in his spirit (2:13) and even being heavily downcast, was anxious to see Titus to obtain information concerning the Corinthians' response. Now Titus not only came but also brought glad news of their positive response. This was a great comfort to the apostle. ",
  "5007":"Lit., presence. So also in the next verse. ",
  "5008":"Referring to the apostle's first Epistle to the Corinthians. ",
  "5009":"This indicates that the apostle was not only bold and frank in rebuking the believers in his first Epistle, but was also tender and soft toward them. ",
  "5010":"This shows that the apostle's first Epistle to the believers had an effect on them. ",
  "5011":"This was the result the apostle sought in writing his first Epistle. ",
  "5012":"The apostle's first Epistle made the Corinthians sorrowful according to God, not sorrowful for anything else. This indicates that they had been brought back, reconciled, to God. ",
  "5013":"Referring to being reconciled to God (5:20), resulting in more life, which is versus death. Through this the apostle saw the fruit of his first Epistle to the believers. ",
  "5014":"Or, diligence. Referring to the earnest care of the repentant Corinthian believers toward the apostle, which arose because of his loving concern for their relationship with God and their condition before God. Formerly, they had been careless with regard to the apostle's concern; now in repentance they became careful and earnest regarding it. So also in v. 12. ",
  "5015":"Or, produced. All seven results produced by the repentant sorrow of the Corinthian believers, as listed in this verse, were a rich reaping from the apostle's first Epistle to them. ",
  "5016":"Occurring six times in this verse and meaning not only that, but also. ",
  "5017":"Or, vindication, clearing of yourselves; referring to the Corinthian believers' vindicating of themselves to Paul through Titus, proving their innocence regarding the offense. ",
  "5018":"Indignation at the offense and against the offender. ",
  "5019":"Fear of the apostle, who might come with a rod (1 Cor. 4:21). ",
  "5020":"Longing for the apostle. The repentant believers feared the apostle, yet they also had a longing for him. ",
  "5021":"Zeal to mete out a just punishment to the offender. ",
  "5022":"I.e., the meting out of justice, the doing of justice to all parties as disciplinary punishment (2:6). <br><br>   The last six results of the repentant sorrow that is according to God fall into three pairs, the first relating to the Corinthian believers' feelings of shame, the second to the apostle, and the third to the offender (Bengel). Wuest's translation also indicates this by the expression \"Yes, ... in fact,\" which is used three times as follows: \"Yes, verbal defense of yourselves, in fact, indignation, yes, fear, in fact, longing, yes, zeal, in fact, the meting out of disciplinary punishment.\" ",
  "5023":"Referring to the matter of incest, which was condemned by the apostle in ch. 5 of the first Epistle. ",
  "5024":"The incestuous brother (1 Cor. 5:1). ",
  "5025":"The father of the incestuous brother. ",
  "5026":"The Corinthian believers did love the apostles and did have earnest care toward them, but they had been turned aside by false teachers. Hence, the apostle wrote the first Epistle to bring them back, that their love and earnest care toward the apostles might be made manifest to them. ",
  "5027":"This indicates that the apostle was very human and emotional in his ministering of life. ",
  "5028":"This major section, from 2:12--7:16, concerning the apostles' ministry of the new covenant and concerning themselves as the ministers of the new covenant, begins with the apostle's being anxious to meet Titus because of his loving concern for the Corinthian believers (2:13), and ends with his being comforted and cheered by Titus's coming with positive news concerning the Corinthians. ",
  "5029":"This proves that even though the apostles were human and emotional, they still remained in their spirit in their ministering of life. ",
  "5030":"Lit., bowels. The same Greek word as for inward parts in 6:12. See note 8 in Phil. 1. ",
  "5031":"Or, am confident in you. Now the apostle was encouraged by the Corinthian believers and could have confidence in them. ",
  "5032":"See note 10 in 1 Cor. 15. By this grace, which is the resurrection life of Christ, the Macedonian believers overcame the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches (see note 1 in 1 Cor. 16) and became generous in ministering to the needy saints. ",
  "5033":"See 2:9 and note 2 there, and note 13 in ch. 9. ",
  "5034":"The same Greek word is used for singleness and simplicity. See 1:12 and Rom. 12:8. ",
  "5035":"The Macedonian believers besought of the apostles the grace that they might participate (have fellowship) in the ministry to the needy saints. They were not asked to have a share in this matter; rather, they begged for it. They considered it a grace that the apostles would allow them such a share. ",
  "5036":"The Lord wants the believers themselves much more than He wants what they have. ",
  "5037":"They gave themselves not only to the Lord but also to the apostles to be one with the apostles in the accomplishing of their ministry. ",
  "5038":"It was through the will of God, through the sovereign divine agent, that the believers gave themselves first to the Lord, and to the apostles. ",
  "5039":"The act of giving. ",
  "5040":"This indicates that besides this grace, the grace of giving, Titus completed other things among the Corinthian believers. ",
  "5041":"Or, utterance. ",
  "5042":"See note 11 in ch. 7. ",
  "5043":"Some MSS read, the love from you in us. ",
  "5044":"The love that was in the believers was infused into them from the apostles. ",
  "5045":"The act of love shown in the giving of material things to the needy saints. The believers' grace was the issue of God's grace, which was motivating them. In the fellowship concerning the ministry to the saints, the apostle referred to the grace of four parties: (1) the grace of God, which was given to the Macedonian believers to motivate them and enable them to give with liberality (vv. 1-2); (2) the grace of the apostles, which allowed the believers to participate in the ministry to the needy saints (v. 4); (3) the grace of the believers, which was their ministering of material things to the needy ones (vv. 6-7); and (4) the grace of Christ, that He became poor that we might become rich (v. 9). This indicates that the believers' offering of material possessions to the Lord for any purpose should be absolutely a matter of grace, not of human maneuvering. ",
  "5046":"It is grace to us that the Lord Jesus, being rich, became poor for our sakes. In the same principle, it is grace to others that we would sacrifice our material riches for their sakes. ",
  "5047":"The apostle's opinion expressed the Lord's will and desire. See note 25 in 1 Cor. 7. ",
  "5048":"This quotation from Exo. 16 refers to God's heavenly way of balancing the supply of manna among His people, and is applied here to the ministering of material things to the needy saints. Manna was gathered for the daily supply of God's people; they had a sufficient supply no matter how much or how little they gathered. Gathering manna was their duty, and they were to do their duty without being greedy. In like manner, as children of God we should not be greedy or try to preserve our money for ourselves, for whether or not we give, the outcome will be the same, for God in His sovereignty is active to practice a heavenly balancing of the wealth among His people. The result is that He takes care of our daily needs, so that he who preserves much for himself has no excess and he who preserves little for himself has no lack. ",
  "5049":"Or, diligence. Referring to Paul's diligence, earnestness, toward the believers. ",
  "5050":"The entreaty of the apostle. ",
  "5051":"See notes 6 and 7. ",
  "5052":"Money, which is used very much by the devil to seduce man into dishonesty, is involved in the ministry of material things to the saints. In order to avoid being blamed through man's suspiciousness in this matter, the apostles sent with Titus a reputable brother as a witness. ",
  "5053":"The abundance of material gifts. ",
  "5054":"Or, take forethought for, consider in advance (as in Rom. 12:17). This must be quoted from Prov. 3:4, where the Septuagint reads, \"And exercise foresight for what is honorable in the sight of the Lord, and of men.\" ",
  "5055":"Another faithful brother was sent with the two, that by the mouth of three witnesses a strong testimony might be established (Matt. 18:16). This displayed the apostle Paul's carefulness in doing things. ",
  "5056":"Or, earnest. ",
  "5057":"Sent ones, those sent by the churches. ",
  "5058":"See note 1 in ch. 1. ",
  "5059":"The Greek word denotes the groundwork on which some superstructure is founded; hence, foundation, ground; thence, confidence. The same Greek word as in 11:17. ",
  "5060":"Or, bounty; a willing gift of generosity given as a blessing to others (Gen. 33:11; Judg. 1:15; Ezek. 34:26; Prov. 11:25, \"soul of blessing\" in KJV margin). ",
  "5061":"Willing and generous giving makes the gift a blessing to the receiver; unwilling and grudging giving, withheld by a covetous heart, makes the gift a matter of covetousness to the giver. ",
  "5062":"Bountiful givings as blessings to the receivers. ",
  "5063":"Bountiful harvests as blessings from God to the givers. ",
  "5064":"I.e., by being forced or pressed. ",
  "5065":"From Prov. 22:8, where the Septuagint reads, \"God blesses a cheerful and liberal man.\" ",
  "5066":"Or, hilarious, gleeful. ",
  "5067":"Every kind of grace. See note 6 in ch. 8. ",
  "5068":"As in sowing (v. 6). ",
  "5069":"The Greek word denotes one who is obliged to do menial work to eke out a living. It is not the common word for poor. ",
  "5070":"Generous giving is, on the one hand, a blessing to the receivers, and, on the other hand, righteousness in the eyes of both God and man. ",
  "5071":"God cares for His children and feeds them in two ways: in the way of miracles, as shown by the manna, and in the way of natural law, as shown by sowing and reaping. Concerning both of these means of supply, God is the source. He is the One who sends the manna, and He is the One who supplies the seed for sowing and the bread for food. Having a deep realization of these facts and possessing a thorough knowledge of God's economy, the apostle had the assurance and the peace to encourage the impoverished saints in Macedonia (8:2; 9:2) to give of what they had to meet the needs of others. ",
  "5072":"See note 2 in ch. 8. So also in v. 13. ",
  "5073":"Priestly service. See note 25 in Phil. 2. ",
  "5074":"The approving by the needy saints in Judea of the Gentile believers' ministry to them. The Greek word for approving means test, trial, experiment (see 2:9 and note 1); hence, approving, proof. This indicates that the ministry to the saints will be tested, tried, and approved by the saints to prove the generous character of the ministry. ",
  "5075":"Or, communication (cf. contribute in Rom. 12:13, and had fellowship in Phil. 4:15). Referring to the ministry of supply, which was a fellowship between the Gentile believers and those in Judea. ",
  "5076":"I.e., immeasurable. ",
  "5077":"See notes 1 and 6 in ch. 8. ",
  "5078":"Lit., not to be told thoroughly. ",
  "5079":"I.e., the grace given to the believers. ",
  "5080":"But here indicates a contrast. In chs. 8 and 9 the apostle spoke pleasantly to the dear saints in Corinth, encouraging them to have fellowship in the ministry to the needy saints in Judea. Immediately after that, he desired to make himself more clear to them by vindicating, with a severe and unpleasant word, his apostleship, even his apostolic authority. This was needed because of the vague and clouded situation caused by the false, Judaistic apostles (11:11-15), whose teaching and assertion of what they were had distracted the Corinthian believers from the fundamental teachings of the authentic apostles, and especially from the proper realization of Paul's standing as an apostle. ",
  "5081":"To be meek is to be mild toward men, without resisting or disputing. This indicates that the apostle, being firmly attached to Christ (1:21) and being one with Him, lived by Him, behaving in His virtues. ",
  "5082":"Denoting humility, yieldingness, approachableness. See notes 5 in Phil. 4 and 3 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "5083":"A word used in ancient times by pagans to express contempt for the Christian virtue of humility. ",
  "5084":"Or, of good courage. The apostle was bold, having courage to speak out in his Epistle the real situation. ",
  "5085":"Being human, the apostles were still in flesh; hence, they walked in flesh. But, especially in spiritual warfare, they did not walk according to the flesh; they walked according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). ",
  "5086":"Since spiritual warfare is not against flesh but against spiritual forces (Eph. 6:12), the weapons should not be fleshly but spiritual. Such weapons are powerful to overthrow the strongholds of the enemy. ",
  "5087":"I.e., powerful in God's view, divinely powerful; hence, exceedingly powerful. ",
  "5088":"Reasonings and thoughts are in and of the mind. These are the strongholds of Satan, God's adversary, within the minds of those who are disobedient to God. Through the spiritual warfare, reasonings must be overthrown and every thought must be taken captive to obey Christ. ",
  "5089":"The haughty things within the reprobate mentality that are against the knowledge of God. These too must be overthrown by the spiritual weapons that they might no longer rise up against the knowledge of God. ",
  "5090":"This is a bold and severe word with a rebuke. ",
  "5091":"Our obedience affords a base from which the Lord can deal with others' disobedience. ",
  "5092":"This indicates that to be of Christ is an important matter. It is vital to the Christian life and ministry. ",
  "5093":"Apostolic authority, in contrast to people's consideration in their natural concept, is not for ruling over the believers but for building them up. ",
  "5094":"See note 3 in 1 Cor. 2. ",
  "5095":"Or, of no account. Lit., made nothing of. ",
  "5096":"The apostle was bold, but not without limit. This shows that he was under the restriction of the Lord. His boasting was according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure, the ruling God, had apportioned to him. ",
  "5097":"Paul's ministry to the Gentile world, including Corinth, was according to the measure of God (Eph. 3:1-2, 8; Gal. 2:8). Hence, his boast was within this limit and, in contrast to that of the Judaizers, was not without measure. ",
  "5098":"Lit., measuring rod. Like the rule of a carpenter. ",
  "5099":"As the Judaizers did. ",
  "5100":"By being enlarged, increased. The apostles had the hope that through the growth of the Corinthian believers' faith, the apostles' ministry would be magnified (in the sense of being praised) by being enlarged and increased abundantly, yet still according to the rule, the measure, that God had apportioned to them. ",
  "5101":"Referring ironically to the apostle's forced self-vindication and boasting. ",
  "5102":"Like the jealousy of a husband over his wife. ",
  "5103":"To be the bride for the Bridegroom (John 3:29), the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7). ",
  "5104":"See note 14 in ch. 3. ",
  "5105":"Or, singleness. Referring to the believers' single-hearted loyalty, single-minded faithfulness, toward Christ. In the garden of Eden, Eve, the wife of Adam, was deceived by the serpent, Satan, through his questioning and undermining of God's word, and was thus carried away to the tree of knowledge and distracted from the simplicity of eating the tree of life (Gen. 3:1-6). Here the church in Corinth, the pure virgin betrothed to Christ, was being deceived by the Judaizers, the ministers of Satan (v. 15), who were undermining God's word by preaching another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different gospel (v. 4). Because of this undermining preaching, the apostle was fearful that the Corinthians would be distracted by the teachings of the Judaizers and would be separated from the genuine appreciation, love, and enjoyment of the precious person of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as their life and their everything. The above-mentioned three things preached by the Judaizers, who intermingled with the believers, were of Satan. ",
  "5106":"Another Jesus means another person; a different spirit means a spirit of a different nature; and a different gospel means a gospel of a different kind. ",
  "5107":"Or, beautifully, ideally. Used here ironically. In v. 1 the apostle expressed his desire that the Corinthian believers, who were bearing with him, would bear more with him. Now in this verse he referred them to the fact that they were bearing beautifully with the false apostles. His idea here was, \"Since you bear with the false apostles so well, so beautifully, so ideally, please bear more with me.\" ",
  "5108":"I.e., apostles in surpassing degree. An ironic reference to the false apostles, mentioned in v. 13 and in 12:11, who surpassed the degree of the genuineness of the apostles. The false apostles were the Judaizers who came to Corinth to preach another Jesus with a different spirit in a different gospel. ",
  "5109":"One who is unlearned, not having the utterance derived from special training. ",
  "5110":"As in Rom. 3:7 and 15:8, truthfulness is an attribute of Christ, as are meekness and gentleness in 10:1. Since the apostle lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior. ",
  "5111":"The super-apostles (v. 5; 12:11). ",
  "5112":"Or, fashioning, disguising (and so in vv. 14-15). The false apostles, being deceitful, fashioned themselves into the appearance of the real apostles, who were true in every way. ",
  "5113":"This indicates that Satan is the source of the false apostles. They followed him in his deceitfulness to frustrate God's economy. ",
  "5114":"God is light, and His angels are of light. In contrast, Satan is darkness, and all his followers are in darkness. There is no fellowship between light and darkness (6:14). ",
  "5115":"These are the true apostles, who carry the ministry of righteousness (3:9). Whatever the ministers of Satan do is altogether unrighteous. Righteousness has no partnership with lawlessness (6:14). ",
  "5116":"See note 4 in ch. 9. ",
  "5117":"An ironic expression applied to the Corinthians. ",
  "5118":"I.e., takes you as a prey (the same word as for caught in Luke 5:5). ",
  "5119":"This is ironic. ",
  "5120":"Lit., As though. ",
  "5121":"Verses 22-23 give a comparison between the apostle and the Judaizers, pointing out clearly that in addition to his needing to enjoy Christ as his life supply, implied in all the preceding chapters, a genuine minister of Christ needs to suffer in following the Lord. Anyone, like the Judaizers, who lacks these two qualifications must be recognized as a false apostle, a minister of Satan, regardless of his claims of apostolic authority (vv. 13-15). ",
  "5122":"Lit., out of my mind. ",

  "5138":"Lit., ethnarch. ",
  "5139":"The apostle was forced to boast, because of the Corinthians' folly. Though it was not expedient for him, it was necessary for their profit. For their building up, he had to boast, that they might be brought back to a sober and proper understanding concerning their relationship with the apostle. ",
  "5140":"Meaning that Paul would now come to boast of the visions and revelations that he had received from the Lord. ",
  "5141":"Revelation is the putting aside of the veil, the unveiling of hidden things; vision is the scene, the view, seen at the unveiling. Many things concerning God's economy and administration in the universe were hidden. The Lord revealed, unveiled, these to the apostle, and he received visions of these hidden things. ",
  "5142":"The apostle (v. 7), not as the old creation but as the new creation (5:17). In this section the apostle desired to boast of the new creation in Christ by boasting of his weaknesses in the flesh, the old creation (vv. 5, 9). ",

  "5146":"The conjunction and is an important word here. It indicates that what is mentioned in vv. 3 and 4 and what is mentioned in the preceding verse are two different matters. Verse 2 tells us that the apostle was caught away to the third heaven. Now, vv. 3 and 4 tell us something further, that the apostle was caught away also to another place, into Paradise. This indicates strongly that Paradise is not the same as the third heaven in v. 2; it refers to a place other than the third heaven. ",
  "5147":"Some MSS read, apart from. ",
  "5148":"The pleasant section of Hades, where the spirits of Abraham and all the just are, awaiting the resurrection (Luke 16:22-23, 25-26), and where the Lord Jesus went after His death and stayed until His resurrection (Luke 23:43; Acts 2:24, 27, 31; Eph. 4:9; Matt. 12:40). This Paradise differs from the Paradise in Rev. 2:7, which will be the New Jerusalem in the millennium. In this section the apostle told of the exceeding greatness of the revelations he had received. In the universe there are mainly three sections: the heavens, the earth, and Hades, which is underneath the earth (Eph. 4:9). As a man living on earth, the apostle knew the things of the earth. But men do not know the things either in the heavens or in Hades. The apostle, however, was brought away to both of these unknown places. Hence, he received visions and revelations of these hidden regions. For this reason he mentioned these two uttermost parts of the universe. ",
  "5149":"Or, superabundance, exceeding greatness, excess. ",
  "5150":"\"Frequent in classical Greek in the sense of a pale or stake\" (Vincent), or a \"sharp pointed staff\" (Alford). Here it might refer to a kind of physical suffering, such as the trouble with his eyes (see note 15 in Gal. 4). ",

  "5152":"See note 10 in 1 Cor. 15. Sufferings and trials are often ordained by the Lord for us that we may experience Christ as grace and power. Hence, in spite of the apostle's entreaty, the Lord would not remove the thorn from the apostle. ",
  "5153":"For the sufficiency of the Lord's grace to be magnified, our sufferings are required; for the perfectness of the Lord's power to be shown forth, our weakness is needed. Hence, the apostle would most gladly boast in his weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace. Both are the resurrected Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us (1 Cor. 15:45; Gal. 2:20) for our enjoyment. ",
  "5154":"The Greek word for tabernacle over is a compound verb composed of two words. The first word means upon, and the second, to dwell in a tent, as in John 1:14 and Rev. 21:3. The compound verb here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon. It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.

  "5179":"Weakness of the body; the same as in 10:10. For Himself, Christ did not need to be weak in any way, but for accomplishing redemption on our behalf, He was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified. However, after being resurrected, He now lives by the power of God. ",
  "5180":"Lit., out of. ",
  "5181":"The apostles followed the pattern of Christ and were willing to be weak in the organic union with Him that they might live with Him a crucified life. Thus they would live together with Him by the power of God directed toward the believers. Apparently, they were weak toward the believers; actually they were powerful. ",
  "5182":"The objective faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19 and note 3). If one is in the objective faith, he surely has the subjective faith, believing in Christ and the entire content of God's New Testament economy. This is what the apostle asked the Corinthians to test. ",
  "5183":"To test is to determine one's condition; to prove is to verify that one meets the qualifications for a particular status. ",
  "5184":"As long as a believer realizes that Jesus Christ is in him, he is qualified, approved, as a genuine member of Christ. ",
  "5185":"I.e., disqualified. ",
  "5186":"By this word the apostle turned to himself and the other apostles, indicating that they, having Christ living and speaking in them, were fully qualified and not disapproved, especially among the troublesome Corinthians. The apostle earnestly hoped that they might recognize this and have no further questions about him. ",
  "5187":"This indicates that the believers' doing good proved the qualifications and teaching of the apostles. However, the apostle did not care to use this as a ground for exercising his apostolic authority to discipline them; he cared for their doing good that they might be established and built up. ",
  "5188":"For indicates that v. 8 is an explanation of what is mentioned in the preceding verse. The apostle expected the Corinthian believers to do good, but not so that the apostles would appear approved. To edify the believers to do good is for the truth, but for the apostles to cause themselves to appear approved and to defend themselves to the believers (12:19) is against the truth. The Lord would not enable the apostles to do this; hence, they were not able to do it. ",
  "5189":"The reality of the contents of the faith. See note 4 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "5190":"To be weak here is the same as to appear disapproved. When the apostles appeared disapproved, they were weak in administering discipline to the believers. When the believers did good, they were powerful and made the apostles powerless to discipline them. The apostles rejoiced over this and prayed for this, i.e., for the believers' perfecting. ",
  "5191":"Or, restoring. Implying repairing, adjusting, putting in order again, mending; perfectly joining together (cf. 1 Cor. 1:10 and note 4), thoroughly equipping, well furnishing; thus, perfecting, completing, educating. The apostles prayed for the Corinthians that they might be restored, put in order again, and thoroughly equipped and edified to grow in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. ",
  "5192":"Since the apostles were rejoicing (v. 9), they were able to exhort the believers also to rejoice. This was not to be done in their natural life but in the Lord (Phil. 3:1; 4:4; 1 Thes. 5:16). ",
  "5193":"Or, completed thoroughly. I.e., repaired or adjusted, put in order again, mended, perfectly joined together; thus, restored. In Greek this word is the root of the word for perfecting in v. 9 and in Eph. 4:12. ",
  "5194":"The apostles were comforted by the God of all comfort (1:3-6). The Corinthians were very discouraged by the apostle's first Epistle to them. Now, in the second Epistle, he comforted them with the comfort of God (7:8-13). ",
  "5195":"Thinking the same thing must have been the main thing in which the distracted and confused Corinthians needed to be perfected, adjusted, put in order, and restored, as the apostle had exhorted in his first Epistle (1 Cor. 1:10). ",
  "5196":"At peace with one another, and probably with God also. ",
  "5197":"The Corinthians were lacking in love (1 Cor. 8:1; 13:1-3, 13; 14:1) and were short of peace because they were disturbed by the distracting teachings and confusing concepts. Hence, the apostle wished that the God of love and peace would be with them for their adjusting and perfecting. They needed to be filled with the love and peace of God that they might walk according to love (Rom. 14:15; Eph. 5:2) and have peace with one another (Rom. 14:19; Heb. 12:14). ",
  "5198":"A kiss of pure love without any contaminating mixture. ",
  "5199":"The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17 and note 1; 1 Cor. 15:10 and note 1), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. These are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three \"hypostases ... of the one same undivided and indivisible\" God (Philip Schaff). The Greek word for hypostasis (used in Heb. 11:1 &#151; see note 2 there), the singular form of hypostases, refers to a support under, a support beneath, i.e., something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead. <br><br>   The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues. Here the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because this book is on the grace of Christ (1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9). Such a divine attribute of three virtues &#151; love, grace, and fellowship &#151; and such a Triune God of the three divine hypostases &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; were needed by the distracted and confused yet comforted and restored Corinthian believers. Hence, the apostle used all these divine and precious things in one sentence to conclude his lovely and dear Epistle. <br><br>   This verse is strong proof that the trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology but for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people. In the Bible the Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. It is always revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with His creatures, especially with man, who was created by Him, and more particularly with His chosen and redeemed people. The first divine title used in the divine revelation, Elohim in Hebrew, a title used in relation to God's creation, is plural in number (Gen. 1:1), implying that God, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth for man, is triune. Concerning His creation of man in His own image, after His own likeness, He used the plural pronouns Us and Our, referring to His trinity (Gen. 1:26) and implying that He would be one with man and express Himself through man in His trinity. Later, in Gen. 3:22 and 11:7 and Isa. 6:8, He referred to Himself again and again as Us in regard to His relationship with man and with His chosen people. <br><br>   In order to redeem fallen man that He might again have the position to be one with man, He became incarnated (John 1:1, 14) in the Son and through the Spirit (Luke 1:31-35) to be a man, and lived a human life on the earth, also in the Son (Luke 2:49) and by the Spirit (Luke 4:1; Matt. 12:28). At the beginning of His ministry on the earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18) in order that He might reach men and bring them back to Him. Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), He unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words (John 14--17), stating that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (John 14:9-11), that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son (John 14:16-20), that the three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment (John 14:23; 17:21-23), and that all that the Father has is the Son's and all that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be declared to the believers (John 16:13-15). Such a Trinity is altogether related to the dispensing of the processed God into His believers (John 14:17, 20; 15:4-5) that they may be one in and with the Triune God (John 17:21-23). <br><br>   After His resurrection He charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19); that is, He charged the disciples to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who had passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and had entered into resurrection. Based on such an organic union, the apostle, at the conclusion of this divine Epistle to the Corinthians, blessed them with the blessed Divine Trinity in the participation in the Son's grace with the Father's love through the Spirit's fellowship. In this Divine Trinity, God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-6). <br><br>   The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ. Chapter 1 of Ephesians unveils that God the Father chose and predestinated these members in eternity (Eph. 1:4-5), that God the Son redeemed them (Eph. 1:6-12), and that God the Spirit, as a pledge, sealed them (Eph. 1:13-14), thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:18-23). Chapter 2 shows us that in the Divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father, through God the Son, in God the Spirit (Eph. 2:18). This indicates that the three coexist and coinhere simultaneously, even after all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. In ch. 3 the apostle prayed that God the Father would grant the believers to be strengthened through God the Spirit into their inner man, that Christ, God the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that is, occupy their entire being, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:14-19). This is the climax of the believers' experience of and participation in God in His trinity. Chapter 4 portrays how the processed God as the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father is mingled with the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4-6) so that all the members of the Body may experience the Divine Trinity. Chapter 5 exhorts the believers to praise the Lord, God the Son, with the songs of God the Spirit, and give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Son, to God the Father (Eph. 5:19-20). This is to praise and thank the processed God in His divine trinity for our enjoyment of Him as the Triune God. Chapter 6 instructs us to fight the spiritual warfare by being empowered in the Lord, God the Son, putting on the whole armor of God the Father, and wielding the sword of God the Spirit (Eph. 6:10, 11, 17). This is the believers' experience and enjoyment of the Triune God even in the spiritual warfare. <br><br>   The apostle Peter, in his writing, confirmed that God is triune for the believers' enjoyment, referring the believers to the election of God the Father, the sanctification of God the Spirit, and the redemption of Jesus Christ, God the Son, accomplished by His blood (1 Pet. 1:2). And John the apostle strengthened the revelation that the Divine Trinity is for the believers' participation in the processed Triune God. In the book of Revelation he blessed the churches in different localities with grace and peace from God the Father, Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from God the Spirit, the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from God the Son, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:4-5). John's blessing given to the churches indicated also that the processed Triune God, in all He is as the eternal Father, in all He is able to do as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, and in all He has attained and obtained as the anointed Son, is for the believers' enjoyment, that they may be His corporate testimony as the golden lampstands (Rev. 1:9, 11, 20). <br><br>   Thus, it is evident that the divine revelation of the trinity of the Godhead in the holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for theological study but for the apprehending of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people, that we as His chosen and redeemed people may, as indicated in the apostle's blessing to the Corinthian believers, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity. Amen. ",
  "5200":"The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians form a cluster of Epistles that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament. The essential subject of these four books is Christ and the church. Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion with its law; Ephesians reveals the church as the Body of Christ; Philippians concerns the experience, the living out, of Christ; and Colossians unveils the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ as the Head of the Body. ",
  "5201":"The purpose of this book is to cause its receivers to know that the gospel preached by the apostle Paul was not from man's teaching (vv. 11-12) but from God's revelation. Hence, in the very opening of this book Paul emphasized that he became an apostle not from men nor through man but through Christ and God. ",
  "5202":"The law dealt with man as the old creation, whereas the gospel makes man the new creation in resurrection. God made Paul an apostle not by the law according to his natural man in the old creation but through the resurrection of Christ according to his regenerated man in the new creation. Hence, Paul did not say here, \"God the Father, who gave the law through Moses,\" but \"God the Father, who raised Him [Christ] from the dead.\" God's New Testament economy is not with men in the old creation but with men in the new creation through the resurrection of Christ. ",
  "5203":"The apostle considered all the brothers who were with him co-writers that they might be a testimony and a confirmation of what he wrote in this Epistle. ",
  "5204":"Galatia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire. Through Paul's preaching ministry, churches were established in a number of cities in that province. Hence, churches, not church, was used when the apostle referred to the churches in Galatia collectively. ",
  "5205":"See notes 2 in Eph. 1 and 7 in Rom. 1. ",
  "5206":"See note 2 in Eph. 1. ",
  "5207":"Lit., pluck us out, draw us out, extricate us from. ",
  "5208":"An age is a part of the world, which is the satanic system (see note 2 in Eph. 2). According to the context of this book, the present evil age here refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by 6:14-15, where circumcision is considered a part of the world &#151; the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. Here the apostle emphasized that the purpose of Christ's giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God's chosen people from the custody of the law (3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word Paul indicated what he was going to deal with: he wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and bring them back to the grace of the gospel. ",
  "5209":"Here Paul came to his subject. Because the churches in Galatia were deserting the grace of Christ and backsliding to the observance of the law, Paul was burdened to write this Epistle. ",
  "5210":"Or, by. ",
  "5211":"The grace of Christ is the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; processed to become our enjoyment. This grace is versus the law of Moses (John 1:17 and note 1). ",
  "5212":"This was the Judaic observance of the law. Paul's gospel, which is outside the Judaic law, includes all the major items of the four Gospels. Moreover, it covers many more items so that the revelation of the word of God in the New Testament might be completed (Col. 1:25) with crucial items such as Christ in the believers as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27); the Spirit of God as a seal and a pledge (Eph. 1:13-14); God's Son being revealed in us (v. 16), being formed in us (4:19), making His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and filling us unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19); and Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and as the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:9). The focal point of Paul's gospel is that the Son of God, God's anointed One (the Christ), has entered into our being to be our life today (Col. 3:4) and our glory in the future (Col. 1:27) that we may be the members (Rom. 12:5) of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:16), of which Christ is the Head (Eph. 4:15). ",
  "5213":"The observance of the law could never be a gospel that could set sinners free from the bondage of the law and bring them into the enjoyment of God; it could only keep them as slaves under the bondage of the law, entangling them with the yoke of slavery of the law (5:1). ",
  "5214":"The Judaizers, whom the apostle Paul considered false brothers (2:4). ",
  "5215":"The Judaizers troubled the churches by perverting, distorting, the gospel of Christ, thus misleading the believers into going back to the law of Moses. ",
  "5216":"Or, persuading men or God; seeking to conciliate, to satisfy, men or God. ",
  "5217":"Neither ... from man corresponds with not from men in v. 1. ",
  "5218":"The revelation given to the apostle Paul by the Lord Jesus Christ concerning the gospel. ",
  "5219":"I.e., the Jewish religion, which is in contrast to the Son of God and the church (vv. 13-16). ",
  "5220":"Traditions in the sect of the Pharisees, of which Paul was a member. He called himself \"a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees\" (Acts 23:6). The Jewish religion was composed not only of the God-given law and its rituals but also of manmade traditions. ",
  "5221":"I.e., designated or distinguished for a purpose. ",
  "5222":"I.e., before he was born. ",
  "5223":"After he was born, at his conversion. ",
  "5224":"Paul was called to be an apostle through the grace of Christ, not through the law announced by Moses. ",
  "5225":"Not to teach but to unveil, to give a vision of, to show. ",
  "5226":"The Son of God, as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3), is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:5-6). As the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), He is far superior to Judaism and its traditions (vv. 13-14). The Judaizers had bewitched the Galatians into considering that the ordinances of the law were above the Son of the living God. Hence, in the opening of this Epistle the apostle testified that he had been deeply involved and had become far advanced in the realm of Judaism, but that God had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God's eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience he realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions handed down from his forefathers. ",
  "5227":"God's revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. It is not an objective revelation but a subjective one. <br><br>   God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him (v. 15), and revealing His Son in him. ",
  "5228":"The apostle Paul did not preach the law but announced Christ, the Son of God, as the gospel; he announced not merely the doctrine concerning Him but the living person Himself. ",
  "5229":"The heathen Gentiles. ",
  "5230":"This confirms that the apostle did not receive the gospel from man (v. 12). ",
  "5231":"I.e., man, composed of flesh and blood. ",
  "5232":"It is difficult to trace where in Arabia Paul went and how long he stayed there after his conversion. However, the place must have been away from the Christians, and the time of his stay there must not have been short. His purpose in referring to his stay in Arabia was to testify that he did not receive the gospel from man (v. 12). In Arabia he must have received some revelation concerning the gospel directly from the Lord. ",
  "5233":"The Greek word implies to visit in order to become acquainted with. ",
  "5234":"This indicates that James, the brother of the Lord, and Cephas (v. 18), who was Peter, were at that time the leading ones among the apostles. ",
  "5235":"Arabia (v. 17), Syria, and Cilicia were all regions of the Gentile world. By mentioning his journeys to all these places, Paul testified that the revelation he received concerning the gospel was not from any men, that is, from any Christians, who at that time were mainly in Judea (v. 22). ",
  "5236":"Paul said this to strengthen the point that he did not receive the gospel from any who were believers in Christ before him. ",
  "5237":"The churches, which included all the believers in Christ in Judea, only heard the news of Paul's conversion and glorified God because of him. They had nothing to do with his receiving the revelation concerning the gospel. ",
  "5238":"The faith here and in all the verses of reference 23 implies our believing in Christ, taking His person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith. The faith, replacing the law, by which God dealt with people in the Old Testament, became the principle by which God deals with people in the New Testament. This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of law. This is the main emphasis of this book. The law of the Old Testament stresses letters and ordinances, whereas the faith of the New Testament emphasizes the Spirit and life. ",
  "5239":"As recorded in Acts 15, this was after a number of churches had been raised up in the Gentile world through Paul's ministry (see Acts 13--14). This indicates that Paul's preaching of the gospel to raise up the Gentile churches had nothing to do with the believers in Jerusalem and Judea. ",
  "5240":"Not only Paul's gospel but even his going up to Jerusalem were according to the Lord's revelation, not according to any organization or system. Paul's move and activity were according to the Lord's instant leading. This again indicates that his preaching of the gospel was not according to man's teaching but according to the Lord's direct revelation. ",
  "5241":"This indicates that in his move for the Lord's testimony, Paul did not care for the observance of the law. ",
  "5242":"Judaism was built upon the God-given law with its three pillars: circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy dietary regulations. All three were ordained by God (Gen. 17:9-14; Exo. 20:8-11; Lev. 11) as shadows of things to come (Col. 2:16-17). Circumcision was a shadow of the crucifixion of Christ in its putting off of the flesh, as signified in baptism (Col. 2:11-12). The Sabbath was a type of Christ as the rest for His people (Matt. 11:28-30). The holy diet symbolized persons who are clean and persons who are unclean, those whom God's holy people should contact and those they should not contact (Acts 10:11-16, 34-35). Once Christ had come, all these shadows should have been terminated. Hence, the observance of the Sabbath was abolished by the Lord Jesus in His ministry (Matt. 12:1-12), the holy dietary regulations were annulled by the Spirit in Peter's ministry (Acts 10:9-20), and circumcision was counted as nothing in the revelation received by Paul in his ministry (5:6; 6:15). Furthermore, the law, the base of Judaism, has been terminated and replaced by Christ (Rom. 10:4; Gal. 2:16). Thus, Judaism in its entirety is finished. ",
  "5243":"The Judaizers, who perverted the gospel of Christ by secretly bringing the observances of the law into the church and troubled the genuine brothers in Christ (1:7). ",
  "5244":"Freedom from the bondage of the law. This freedom in Christ Jesus includes (1) release from the bondage of the law, implying liberation from obligation to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations; (2) full satisfaction, with a rich, supporting supply; (3) the enjoyment of true rest, without being under the heavy burden to keep the law; and (4) the full enjoyment of the living Christ. ",
  "5245":"Slavery under the law. ",
  "5246":"Not the doctrine or the teaching of the gospel but the reality of the gospel. ",
  "5247":"When the apostles were listed, Peter was usually mentioned first (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). Here, however, James was mentioned first. This indicates that at that time Peter was not the foremost leading one in the church; rather, it was James, the brother of the Lord (1:19). This is confirmed by Acts 15:13-21, where James, not Peter, was the authority who gave the final, decisive word in the conference held in Jerusalem. It must have been because of Peter's weakness in not holding the truth of the gospel, as illustrated by Paul in vv. 11-14, that James came to the forefront to take the lead among the apostles. Hence, both in v. 12 and in Acts 21:18 James was considered the representative of the church in Jerusalem and of the apostles. This is strong proof that Peter was not always the foremost leader in the church. Furthermore, this implies that leadership in the church is not organizational and perpetual; rather, it is spiritual and fluctuates according to the spiritual condition of the leading ones. This strongly rebuts Catholicism in its assertion that Peter was the only successor of Christ in the administration of the church. ",
  "5248":"I.e., from the church in Jerusalem. This is another indication that at that time James, not Peter, was the first among the apostles in Jerusalem. ",
  "5249":"This was contrary to the customary practice of the Jews in their keeping of the observances of the law. ",
  "5250":"This proves that at that time Peter was very weak in the pure Christian faith. In Acts 10 he had received an exceedingly clear vision from the heavens concerning fellowship with the Gentiles, and he took the lead to practice it. What weakness and backsliding to shrink from eating with Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision! It is no wonder that he lost the leadership among the apostles. ",
  "5251":"When the leading one backslid, the rest easily followed. ",
  "5252":"That Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel is almost incredible. ",
  "5253":"Barnabas participated in Paul's first ministry journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches. Even one who had so much fellowship with the Gentile believers was carried away in Peter's hypocrisy. What a negative influence Peter exerted on others! Surely he deserved to lose his leadership. ",
  "5254":"Lit., walking straight-footedly. ",
  "5255":"I.e., eat, live, and fellowship with the Gentiles. ",
  "5256":"Lit., Judaize; i.e., live like the Jews, not eating or fellowshipping with the Gentiles. ",
  "5257":"Lit., faith of Jesus Christ. See note 22 in Rom. 3. Faith in Jesus Christ denotes an organic union with Him through believing. This is related to the believers' appreciation of the person of the Son of God as the most precious One. The believers are infused with the preciousness of Christ through the gospel preached to them. This Christ becomes in them the faith by which they believe and the capacity to believe through their appreciation of Him. This faith creates an organic union in which they and Christ are one. ",
  "5258":"Flesh here denotes fallen man, who has become flesh (Gen. 6:3). No fallen man will be justified out of the works of law. ",
  "5259":"One who ministers sin to people, or who serves sin to people. ",
  "5260":"Lit., May it not happen! So throughout the Epistle. ",
  "5261":"I.e., return to Judaism. This refers to Peter's returning to the Judaic observance of not eating with Gentiles. ",
  "5262":"I.e., counted loss, counted as dung (Phil. 3:7-8). Referring to Peter's abandoning of the Judaistic practice of not eating with the Gentiles. ",
  "5263":"The law requires us, as sinners, to die, and according to that requirement Christ died for us and with us. Hence, through law we have died in Christ and with Christ. ",
  "5264":"I.e., the obligation under the law, the relationship to the law, was terminated. ",
  "5265":"I.e., be obligated to God in the divine life. In Christ's death our relationship with the law has been terminated; in His resurrection we are responsible to God in the resurrection life. ",
  "5266":"This explains how it is that through law we have died to law. When Christ was crucified, according to God's economy we were included in Him. This is an accomplished fact. ",
  "5267":"No longer I does not indicate an exchanged life, a life in which Christ comes in and we go out, for later in this verse Paul said, \"I live.\" As regenerated people, we have both the old \"I,\" which has been crucified (Rom. 6:6), concerning which Paul said, \"No longer I,\" and a new \"I,\" concerning which Paul said, \"I live.\" The old, terminated \"I\" was without divinity; the new \"I\" has God as life added to it. The new \"I\" came into being when the old \"I\" was resurrected and God was added to it. On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who was regenerated with God as his life, still lived. Furthermore, although Paul said, \"No longer I,\" he also said, \"It is Christ who lives in me,\" for it was Christ who lived, but it was in Paul that He lived. The two, Christ and Paul, had one life and one living. ",
  "5268":"We have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This point is fully developed in all the following chapters, where the Spirit is presented and emphasized as the very One whom we have received as life and in whom we should live. <br><br>   The \"I,\" the natural person, inclines to keep the law that it might be perfect (Phil. 3:6), but God wants us to live Christ that God might be expressed in us through Him (Phil. 1:20-21). Hence, God's economy is that the \"I\" be crucified in Christ's death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection. To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life. The law was used by God for a period of time to keep His chosen people in custody for Christ (3:23) and eventually to conduct them to Christ (3:24) that they might receive Him as life and live Him to be God's expression. Because Christ has come, the function of the law has been terminated, and Christ must replace the law in our lives for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. ",
  "5269":"Not the physical life nor the soulish life but the spiritual and divine life. ",
  "5270":"In contrast to the way we live the physical and soulish life, we live the divine life not by sight nor by feeling. The divine life, the spiritual life in our spirit, is lived by the exercise of faith, which is stimulated by the presence of the life-giving Spirit. ",
  "5271":"Cf. note 16. ",
  "5272":"The title Christ denotes mainly Christ's mission, which is to carry out God's plan; the Son of God denotes Christ's person, which is for the imparting of God's life into us. Hence, the faith in which we live God's life is of the Son of God, the life-imparting One. ",
  "5273":"The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself up for us that He might impart the divine life into us. ",
  "5274":"The grace of God is that Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, has imparted the divine life into us through the life-giving Spirit. Not to live by this Spirit is to nullify the grace of God. ",
  "5275":"Christ died for us that in Him we may have righteousness, through which we may receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18, 21). This righteousness is not through law but through the death of Christ. ",
  "5276":"Or, without cause. If righteousness is through law, Christ has died without cause. However, righteousness is through Christ's death, and Christ's death has separated us from law. ",
  "5277":"The cross is the center of God's operation in His economy. In this Epistle Paul was bringing the believers who had been distracted to the law back to the cross and encouraging them to behold Christ crucified, that they would never again be distracted to the law. This Epistle provides a thorough view of Christ crucified (1:4; 2:19-21; 3:13; 5:24; 6:14). <br><br>   The crucifixion of Christ indicates that all the requirements of the law have been fulfilled by the death of Christ, and that Christ through His death has released His life that it may be imparted into us in His resurrection to free us from bondage under the law. This was fully portrayed before the eyes of the Galatians in the word of the gospel. How could they neglect this and be bewitched, drifting back to the law? How foolish! ",
  "5278":"When the believers believe into Christ, they receive the Spirit. It is a serious misunderstanding to consider Christ as separate from the Spirit. At the time of regeneration we believed into Christ, and we also received the Spirit and were sealed with the Spirit (Eph. 1:13). At that very moment an organic union took place &#151; we were grafted into the Triune God (Rom. 11:17), and the Spirit as the pledge (Eph. 1:14) became the ultimate blessing of the gospel to us (v. 14). After this, receiving the Spirit is a lifelong, continuous matter. God is supplying the Spirit to us continuously (v. 5). ",
  "5279":"The Galatians, through the hearing of the gospel, believed in the crucified Christ, but they received the Spirit. The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who entered into the believers was the Spirit. In His being crucified for the believers' redemption He was Christ, but in His indwelling the believers to be their life He is the Spirit. This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel. The believers receive such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law. He enters into the believers and lives in them not by their keeping of the law but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ. <br><br>   In the first two chapters of this Epistle there is Christ in the divine revelation as the focal point of God's economy, but in the last four chapters there is the Spirit in our experience for us to have the divine life (ch. 3), to be born of God (ch. 4), to live and walk by the regenerated life (ch. 5), and to take the divine purpose as our goal (ch. 6). Thus, we enjoy Christ continually as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (v. 5a). ",
  "5280":"The law was the basic condition for the relationship between man and God in God's Old Testament economy (v. 23); faith is the unique way for God to carry out His New Testament economy with man (1 Tim. 1:4). The law is related to the flesh (Rom. 7:5) and depends on the effort of the flesh, the very flesh that is the expression of the \"I.\" Faith is related to the Spirit and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, the very Spirit who is the realization of Christ. In the Old Testament the \"I\" and the flesh played an important role in the keeping of the law. In the New Testament Christ and the Spirit take over the position of the \"I\" and the flesh, and faith replaces the law, that we may live Christ by the Spirit. To keep the law by the flesh is man's natural way; it is in the darkness of man's concept and results in death and wretchedness (Rom. 7:10-11, 24). To receive the Spirit out of the hearing of faith is God's revealed way; it is in the light of God's revelation and issues in life and glory (Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11, 30). Hence, we must treasure the hearing of faith, not the works of law. It is by the hearing of faith that we received the Spirit so that we might participate in God's promised blessing and live Christ. The faith mentioned in vv. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 23, 24, and 25 of this chapter is this faith. (See note 23 in ch. 1.) ",
  "5281":"To begin by the Spirit is to begin by faith in Christ; to be perfected by the flesh is to be perfected by works of law (v. 2). ",
  "5282":"The Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ, is of life; the flesh, which is our fallen man, is of sin and death. We should not begin by the Spirit and attempt to be perfected by the flesh. Since we have begun by the Spirit, we should be perfected by the Spirit and have nothing to do with the flesh. In 2:20 the contrast is between Christ and the \"I\"; here the contrast is between the Spirit and the flesh. This indicates that the Spirit is Christ and the flesh is the \"I\" in our experience. From ch. 3 to the end of the Epistle, the Spirit is Christ in our life experience. In revelation, it is Christ; in experience, it is the Spirit. <br><br>   The flesh is condemned and repudiated throughout this book (1:16; 2:16; 3:3; 4:23, 29; 5:13, 16-17, 19, 24; 6:8, 12-13), and from ch. 3 every chapter gives a contrast between the flesh and the Spirit (v. 3; 4:29; 5:16-17, 19, 22; 6:8). The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God. The flesh inclines to keep the law and is tested by the law; the Spirit is received and enjoyed out of faith. God's economy delivers us from the flesh to the Spirit that we may participate in the blessing of the riches of the Triune God. This cannot take place by the flesh keeping the law but by the Spirit being received out of faith and experienced through faith. ",
  "5283":"The Galatians suffered persecution because of their faith in Christ, which had turned them to Christ from the Jewish religion and heathen customs. ",
  "5284":"The Greek word means supplies fully, bountifully, and liberally. See Phil. 1:19. On God's side, He supplies the Spirit bountifully; on our side, we receive the Spirit. Day by day a marvelous divine transmission takes place: God supplies and we receive. The way to open ourselves to this heavenly transmission to receive the supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is to exercise our spirit to pray and call on the Lord. ",
  "5285":"The all-inclusive compound Spirit, typified by the compound ointment in Exo. 30:23-25. This is the Spirit mentioned in John 7:39, who is the life-imparting Christ in resurrection. To the believers in God's New Testament economy, this Spirit is the bountiful supply. The supplying of this Spirit is altogether not out of the works of law but out of faith in the crucified and glorified Christ. ",
  "5286":"Lit., operates. ",
  "5287":"In an attempt to frustrate God's economy, Satan, the enemy of God, uses the law &#151; which was given by God to serve His purpose temporarily &#151; to keep God's chosen people from His economy and to distract them from it. The law is misused when it is used to stir up man's fallen desire to exalt himself by keeping the law that he might have a self-made righteousness. ",
  "5288":"In drifting back to the law, the bewitched Galatians clung to Moses, through whom the law was given; but Paul referred them to Abraham, who was the father of faith. Faith was of God's original economy; the law was added later because of the transgressions (v. 19). After Christ fulfilled the law through His death, God wanted His people to return to His original economy. With Abraham it was not a matter of keeping the law but of believing God. It should be so with all the New Testament believers. ",
  "5289":"I.e., the faith. ",
  "5290":"Works of law make people disciples of Moses (John 9:28), a relationship that has nothing whatever to do with life. Faith in Christ makes the New Testament believers sons of God, a relationship altogether of life. We, the New Testament believers, were born sons of the fallen Adam, and in Adam, because of transgressions, we were under the law of Moses. But we have been reborn sons of Abraham and have been freed from the law of Moses by faith in Christ. ",
  "5291":"The promise God gave to Abraham, \"In you shall all the nations be blessed,\" was the gospel. It was preached to Abraham not only before the accomplishing of redemption by Christ but also before the giving of the law through Moses. What God promised to Abraham corresponds with what God accomplished through Christ, which is the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham. The New Testament economy is a continuation of God's dealing with Abraham, having nothing to do with the law of Moses. All the New Testament believers should be in this continuation and should have nothing to do with the law given through Moses. ",
  "5292":"I.e., the faith. ",
  "5293":"Faith in Christ brings us into the blessing that God promised to Abraham, which is the promise of the Spirit (v. 14). ",
  "5294":"Under God's dealing, Abraham was not working to please God but was believing Him. ",
  "5295":"Faith in Christ had brought the Galatian believers into the blessing in Christ, causing them to enjoy the grace of life in the Spirit; but the Judaizers bewitched them and caused them to come under the curse of the law, thus depriving them of the enjoyment of Christ and causing them to fall from grace (5:4). ",
  "5296":"Lit., in; meaning \"in the power of, in virtue of\" (Darby's New Translation). ",
  "5297":"Lit., out of faith; in contrast to by law. ",
  "5298":"Lit., in; meaning in virtue of. ",
  "5299":"As our Substitute on the cross, Christ not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us. The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (Gen. 3:17). When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse of the law. ",
  "5300":"I.e., the cross. ",
  "5301":"The blessing promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) for all the nations of the earth. The promise was fulfilled, and the blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross. ",
  "5302":"In the gospel we have received not only the blessing of forgiveness, washing, and cleansing; even more, we have received the greatest blessing, which is the Triune God &#151; the Father, Son, and Spirit &#151; as the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in us in a most subjective way for our enjoyment. Oh, what a blessing that we can enjoy such an all-inclusive One as our daily portion! ",
  "5303":"This verse indicates that the Spirit is the blessing that God promised to Abraham for all the nations and that has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit, as mentioned in note 5 and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension that we may receive Him as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God. <br><br>   The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see Col. 1:12 and note 2). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the land promised to Abraham. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy. ",
  "5304":"Christ is the seed, and the seed is the heir who inherits the promises. Here, Christ is the unique seed who inherits the promises. Hence, in order to inherit the promised blessing, we must be one with Christ. Outside of Him we cannot inherit the promises given by God to Abraham. In God's eyes Abraham has only one seed, that is, Christ. We must be in Him that we may participate in the promises given to Abraham. He is not only the seed who inherits the promises but also the blessing of the promises to be inherited by us. For the Galatian believers to turn back from Christ to the law meant that they would forfeit both the Heir and the inheritance of the promises. ",
  "5305":"This indicates that the promise God gave to Abraham became a covenant, which is more firm than a promise. The word, the promise, and the covenant are the gospel that was preached to Abraham. The gospel is the covenant, the covenant is the promise, and the promise is the word spoken by God. Although the gospel is a matter of the new testament, it is important to realize that the new testament is a continuation, or repetition, of God's promise to Abraham. ",
  "5306":"God's promise to Abraham was given first. The law came 430 years later. The promise was permanent, but the law was temporary. The law, which came later and was temporary, cannot annul the promise, which was given first and was permanent. The Galatians left the first and permanent promise and went back to the later and temporary law. ",
  "5307":"Counted from the time God gave Abraham the promise in Gen. 12 to the time He gave the law through Moses in Exo. 20. This period was considered by God as the time of the children of Israel's dwelling in Egypt (Exo. 12:40-41). The four hundred years mentioned in Gen. 15:13 and Acts 7:6 is counted from the time Ishmael mocked Isaac in Gen. 21 to the time the children of Israel came out of the Egyptian tyranny in Exo. 12. This is the period during which Abraham's descendants suffered persecution from the Gentiles. ",
  "5308":"The law does not give; it only requires. Inheritance is not of law but of promise. Hence, the inheritance was graciously given to Abraham through promise. ",
  "5309":"The law was not there in the origination of God's economy. It was added because of man's transgressions, while God's economy was proceeding, and was to be in effect until the seed, Christ, should come, to whom God's promise was made. Since it was added because of man's transgressions, it should have been deducted when those transgressions were taken away. And since Christ, the seed, has come, the law must be terminated. ",
  "5310":"Because the law was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator and, unlike the promise, was not given by God directly to the people, it is not primary but secondary in God's economy. ",
  "5311":"The man Moses. ",
  "5312":"With the law there is a mediator between two parties, God and the children of Israel. With the promise there is only God, who is directly related to the one who receives the promise, without a go-between. The responsibility with respect to the law depends not on one party but on two, whereas the responsibility with regard to the promise depends only on the giver, God. Hence, the law is inferior to the promise. The Galatians gave up the superior and went back to the inferior. ",
  "5313":"The law was able only to demand and condemn; it could not give life. (See note 10 in Rom. 7.) There is no life in the law; there are only commandments. Life is in Christ (John 1:4). He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), the only One who is able to give life. The giving of life is the focal point of the apostle's revelation. We should take only the One who gives life. ",
  "5314":"There must be righteousness in order for life to be given. Righteousness, however, is not of law but in Christ (Rom. 5:17-18). Hence, the law is not able to give life. Furthermore, since the law cannot give life, it has no power to fulfill its requirements so that righteousness may be produced. Hence, in this sense also, righteousness is not of law. ",
  "5315":"As a jailer shuts up prisoners. The Scripture, personified here, has shut up all mankind under sin, not that the law might be kept by the imprisoned sinners but that God's promise might be given to the believers by faith in Christ. To be shut up under sin is to be shut up under law, as revealed in v. 23. ",
  "5316":"Lit., all things; i.e., all mankind. ",
  "5317":"Or, faith of Jesus Christ. See note 22 in Rom. 3. ",
  "5318":"See notes 23 in ch. 1 and 2 in ch. 3. So also in v. 25. Faith was not revealed until Christ came (cf. John 1:12; 3:16, 18). ",
  "5319":"Kept in custody, kept in ward. ",
  "5320":"To be guarded under law by being shut up under law is to be like sheep enclosed in a fold (John 10:1, 16). In God's economy the law was used as a fold to keep God's chosen people until Christ came (see note 1 in John 10). Since Christ has come, God's people should no longer be kept under the law (see note 9 in John 10). ",
  "5321":"Or, with a view to. Indicating that shutting up has an object; i.e., it consummates in the faith, it brings the guarded people to the faith. ",
  "5322":"Or, escort, guardian, custodian; one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster. The law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and bring them to Christ when He did come, that they might be justified by faith and participate in the blessing promised and covenanted by God. ",
  "5323":"Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding law any longer. ",
  "5324":"Sons of full age, who have outgrown the custody of the slave guardian. Under the old testament, God's chosen people were considered infants. Now, under the new testament, they are considered sons of full age, who will inherit the promised blessing &#151; the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ. ",
  "5325":"Faith in Christ brings us into Christ, making us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship. We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of God. ",
  "5326":"To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized into Christ. By both faith and baptism we have entered into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Christ. Baptism practiced in a proper, genuine, and living way puts the believers into the name of the Triune God, the divine name (Matt. 28:19); into Christ, a living person (Gal. 3:27); into the death of Christ, an effective death (Rom. 6:3); and into the Body of Christ, a living organism (1 Cor. 12:13), that the believers may enter into an organic union not only with Christ but also with His Body. Furthermore, baptism brings the believers out of their old state into a new one, terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may live in the Body of Christ, an organism, by the elements of the Triune God. ",
  "5327":"See note 11 in Col. 3. ",
  "5328":"Differences among races and nationalities. ",
  "5329":"Differences in social rank. ",
  "5330":"Differences between the sexes. ",
  "5331":"The believers are one in Christ by His resurrection life and His divine nature to be the one new man, as mentioned in Eph. 2:15. This one new man is absolutely in Christ. There is no room for our natural being, our natural disposition, and our natural character; in this one new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). This oneness in Christ is achieved through baptism, which terminates all the divisive distinctions and ushers the believers into the divine organic union with the processed Triune God, resulting in the believers' subjective assurance that they are one with one another. ",
  "5332":"Abraham has only one seed, Christ (v. 16). Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God, who is our portion. Under the new testament, the believers as God's chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. Like Ishmael (4:23), the Judaizers, who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ, were Abraham's descendants according to the flesh; they were not like Isaac (4:28), who was Abraham's heir according to promise. But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing. Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to the law. <br><br>   Since the law is unable to give us life (v. 21), it cannot produce the sons of God; but the Spirit, who is received out of faith (v. 2) and who gives us life (2 Cor. 3:6), can. The law kept God's chosen people under its custody until faith came (v. 23). Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, makes God's chosen people Abraham's seed as \"the stars of the heaven\" (Gen. 22:17) according to God's promise. ",
  "5333":"This chapter reveals that God gave the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose. Before this promise was fulfilled, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God's chosen people. Then, at the appointed time Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill the promise and brought in the promised blessing. This is grace. Hence, grace came with Christ and with the fulfillment of the promise. All this is on God's side. On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and enjoy all that Christ, the seed, is and has accomplished. Therefore, there is grace on God's side, and there is faith on our side. Now, since we have grace, faith, and the seed that has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian. Hence, we must set aside the law and turn from the custodian to stay with Christ that we may enjoy the promised blessing by remaining in grace and faith. This blessing is nothing less than the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. ",
  "5334":"The same Greek word as for little children in Eph. 4:14, referring to a minor. So also in v. 3. ",
  "5335":"Guardians are wardens, and stewards are administrators. These describe the functions of the law in God's economy. ",
  "5336":"The time appointed by the father refers to the time of the New Testament, beginning with the first coming of Christ. ",
  "5337":"The same Greek word as for rudiments in Heb. 5:12. I.e., elementary principles, referring to the rudimentary teachings of the law (see note 8 in Col. 2). So also in v. 9. ",
  "5338":"The completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed by the Father (v. 2). ",
  "5339":"The virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35). The Son of God was born of her to be the seed of woman, as promised in Gen. 3:15. ",
  "5340":"Christ was born under law, as revealed in Luke 2:21-24, 27, and kept the law, as revealed in the four Gospels. ",
  "5341":"God's chosen people were shut up by the law under its custody (3:23). Christ was born under law in order to redeem God's chosen people from the custody of the law that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God. Hence, they should not return to the custody of the law to be under its slavery, as the Galatians were seduced to do, but should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ. ",
  "5342":"Christ's redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life. God's economy is not to make us keepers of the law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God's economy is to make us sons of God, who inherit the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. God's eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:12-13). We should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all that He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not appreciate the law and thereby be distracted to Judaism. ",
  "5343":"God's Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God's Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life not because we are law keepers but because we are His sons. As law keepers, we have no right to enjoy God's Spirit of life; as the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life. Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God's promise to Abraham (3:14). <br><br>   Verses 4-6 of this chapter speak of the Triune God's producing of many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive the sonship. He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality. ",
  "5344":"Actually, the Spirit of God came into our spirit at the time of our regeneration (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). Because our spirit is hidden in our heart (1 Pet. 3:4), and because the word here refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, this verse says that the Spirit of God's Son was sent into our hearts. ",
  "5345":"The parallel verse, Rom. 8:15, says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, \"Abba, Father!\" whereas here it says that the Spirit of God's Son is crying in our hearts, \"Abba, Father!\" This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that our spirit is in our heart. This indicates also that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being. In this verse, Paul appealed to such an experience of the Galatian believers for the supporting of his revelation. This appeal was quite convincing and subduing because it contained not only objective doctrines but also subjective, experiential facts. ",
  "5346":"Abba is an Aramaic word, and Father is the translation of the Greek word Pater. Such a term was used first by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father. ",
  "5347":"The New Testament believer is no longer a slave to works under law but is a son in life under grace. ",
  "5348":"See note 26 in ch. 3. ",
  "5349":"One who is of full age according to the law (the Roman law is used for illustration) and who is qualified to inherit the father's estate. ",
  "5350":"The New Testament believers become heirs of God not through the law nor through their fleshly father but through God, even the Triune God &#151; the Father, who sent forth the Son and the Spirit (vv. 4, 6); the Son, who accomplished redemption for sonship (v. 5); and the Spirit, who carries out the sonship within us (v. 6). ",
  "5351":"The gods, the idols, do not have the divine nature. They were considered gods by their superstitious worshippers, but by nature they are not gods. ",
  "5352":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "5353":"Sabbaths, new moons (Isa. 66:23). ",
  "5354":"Sacred months, such as the first, Abib, the ear month (Exo. 13:4); the second, Ziv, the flower month (1 Kings 6:1, 37); the seventh, Ethanim, the month of streaming rivers (1 Kings 8:2); and the eighth, Bul, the month of rain (1 Kings 6:38). ",
  "5355":"Festal seasons, such as the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles (2 Chron. 8:13). ",
  "5356":"Perhaps sabbatical years (Lev. 25:4). ",
  "5357":"Paul labored upon the Galatians to bring them into Christ under grace. Their turning to the Jewish religious observances could have caused Paul's labor upon them to be in vain. ",
  "5358":"Paul was free from the bondage of Jewish observances. He besought the Galatians to become as he was. ",
  "5359":"Paul became as a Gentile was, for the truth of the gospel. ",
  "5360":"The Galatians had not wronged Paul in the past. Paul expected that they would not wrong him now. ",
  "5361":"In his first ministry journey Paul was detained in Galatia because of physical weakness. While there, he preached the gospel to the Galatians. ",
  "5362":"Lit., spit out. ",
  "5363":"The Galatians formerly considered it a blessing that Paul was detained in their place and preached the gospel to them. They were happy about this and boasted of it. That became their felicitation. However, now that they had departed from Paul's preaching of the gospel, the apostle questioned them, \"Where then is your felicitation, your happiness, your blessedness?\" ",
  "5364":"The Galatians appreciated Paul's preaching and loved him to such an extent that they would have plucked out their eyes and given them to him. This may indicate that Paul's physical weakness (v. 13) was in his eyes. This can perhaps be confirmed by his use of large letters in his writing to them (6:11). This weakness may also have been the thorn in his flesh, a physical weakness, which he prayed would be removed from him (2 Cor. 12:7-9). ",
  "5365":"I.e., zealously court you. ",
  "5366":"Not in an honorable, commendable way. ",
  "5367":"I.e., exclude you from the proper preaching of the gospel, the gospel of grace. ",
  "5368":"I.e., zealously court them. ",
  "5369":"It is always good to zealously court someone in a good thing or in the proper preaching of the gospel. However, this should have taken place not only when Paul was present with them. By this word Paul indicated that he was not narrow, i.e., he did not prohibit others from preaching the gospel to the Galatians; rather, he rejoiced in others' preaching (Phil. 1:18). ",
  "5370":"Paul considered himself the begetting father and the Galatian believers his children begotten of him in Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 4:15; Philem. 10). ",
  "5371":"Painful toil in childbirth. In this metaphor Paul likened himself to a mother who gives birth to a child. He had labored in this way to regenerate the Galatians when he first preached the gospel to them. Because they deviated from the gospel that he had preached to them, he was toiling again in travail until Christ would be formed in them. ",
  "5372":"Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul's gospel. Paul's preaching, which differed greatly from the teaching of the law in letters, was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers. Hence, this book is emphatically Christ-centered. Christ was crucified (3:1) to redeem us out of the curse of the law (3:13) and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world (1:4), and He was resurrected from the dead (1:1) that He might live in us (2:20). We were baptized into Him, being identified with Him, and have put Him on, clothing ourselves with Him (3:27). Thus, we are in Him (3:28) and have become of Him (3:29; 5:24). On the other hand, He has been revealed in us (1:16), He is now living in us (2:20), and He will be formed in us (v. 19). To Him the law has conducted us (3:24), and in Him we are all sons of God (3:26). It is in Him that we inherit God's promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit (3:14). Furthermore, it is in Him that we are all one (3:28). We should not be deprived of all profit from Him and thus be severed from Him (5:4). We need Him to supply us with His grace in our spirit (6:18) that we may live Him. ",
  "5373":"When the Galatian believers were regenerated through Paul's preaching of the gospel to them the first time, Christ was born into them but not formed in them. Here the apostle was travailing again that Christ might be formed in them. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life (2:20), and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity. Christ's being formed in us is needed that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God's promised blessing, and that we may mature in the divine sonship. ",
  "5374":"The apostle wished to change his tone from one of severity to one of affection, like the tone of a mother speaking lovingly to her children. ",
  "5375":"Lit., voice. ",
  "5376":"Paul was puzzled in dealing with the Galatians. He was searching for the best way to recover them from their deviation from Christ. ",
  "5377":"In vv. 21-31 there are two women, Hagar and Sarah; two Jerusalems, one earthly and the other heavenly; two covenants, one of the law and the other of promise; and two sons, one according to the flesh and the other according to the Spirit. The apostle wanted the Galatians to know that they were children of the Jerusalem above, children of the free woman, and he wanted them to appropriate the covenant of promise and, according to the Spirit, enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel (3:14). In this section Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, which is symbolized also by the Jerusalem above, who is our mother; the mother symbolizes grace, by which we are born to be the children of God, who is the very source of grace. Hence, the free woman, the covenant of promise, the Jerusalem above, and the mother all refer to God's grace, which is the very means of our spiritual birth. It was from this grace &#151; Christ &#151; that the Galatians who had been distracted by Judaism fell away (5:4). ",
  "5378":"This book deals strongly with the matter of deviating from Christ by being under the law. Such deviation shuts the believers out from the enjoyment of Christ as their life and their everything. ",
  "5379":"According to the succeeding verses, the law here includes the book of Genesis. The entire Old Testament is called the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:40). The first part is the Law, and the second, the Prophets. ",
  "5380":"According to the flesh means by man's fleshly effort; through promise means through God's power in grace, which is implied in God's promise. Ishmael was born in the former way, but Isaac in the latter. ",
  "5381":"Referring to the two women in v. 22. ",
  "5382":"One is the covenant of promise given to Abraham, which is related to the new testament, the covenant of grace, and the other is the covenant of law given to Moses, which has nothing to do with the new testament. Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, and Hagar, the maidservant, the covenant of law. ",
  "5383":"Where the law was given (Exo. 19:20; 24:12). ",
  "5384":"Slavery under law. ",
  "5385":"Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, signifies the law. Hence, the position of the law is like that of a concubine. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the grace of God (John 1:17), which has the rightful position in God's economy. Like Hagar, the law brought forth children unto slavery, such as the Judaizers. Like Sarah, grace brings forth children unto sonship; these are the New Testament believers. They are no longer under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). They should stand in grace (Rom. 5:2) and not fall from it (5:4). ",
  "5386":"Jerusalem, as God's choice (1 Kings 14:21; Psa. 48:2, 8), should belong to the covenant of promise, symbolized by Sarah. However, because it brings God's chosen people into the bondage of the law, it corresponds with Mount Sinai, which belongs to the covenant of the law, symbolized by Hagar. ",
  "5387":"Lit., serves as a slave. ",
  "5388":"A slave under law. At the apostle's time Jerusalem and her children were slaves under law. ",
  "5389":"The Jerusalem above eventually will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-2), which is related to the covenant of promise. She is the mother of the New Testament believers, who are not slaves under law but sons under grace. We, the New Testament believers, are all born of her from above and will all be in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. ",
  "5390":"This indicates that Abraham's spiritual descendants, who belong to the heavenly Jerusalem, to the covenant of promise under the freedom of grace, are far more numerous than his natural descendants, who belong to the earthly Jerusalem, to the covenant of law under the slavery of the law. ",
  "5391":"Denoting a woman without a husband; hence, a desolate one. ",
  "5392":"Children of promise are children born of the heavenly Jerusalem through grace under the covenant of promise. ",
  "5393":"The two kinds of children brought forth by the two covenants are different in their natures. Those brought forth by the covenant of law are born according to the flesh; those brought forth by the covenant of promise are born according to the Spirit. The children born according to the flesh have no right to participate in God's promised blessing, but the children born according to the Spirit have the full right. The Judaizers were children of the former kind; the believers in Christ are of the latter kind. For flesh and Spirit, see notes 3 in ch. 3 and 19 and 22 in ch. 5. ",
  "5394":"This indicates that Ishmael persecuted Isaac (Gen. 21:9). ",
  "5395":"The children of promise (v. 28) are born according to the Spirit, God's Spirit of life, who is the very blessing of God's promise to Abraham (3:14). ",
  "5396":"The Judaizers, the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh, persecuted the believers, the descendants of Abraham according to the Spirit, as Ishmael persecuted Isaac. ",
  "5397":"The Judaizers, who are under the slavery of the law, are the sons of the maidservant. They shall by no means inherit God's promised blessing &#151; the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God. ",
  "5398":"The New Testament believers, who are under the freedom of grace, are the sons of the free woman. They shall inherit the promised blessing of the Spirit. ",
  "5399":"We, the believers in Christ, are not children of the law under the slavery of the law but children of grace under the freedom of grace to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit with all the riches of Christ. ",
  "5400":"Freedom from the slavery of the law. Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom in grace. ",
  "5401":"I.e., stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace. ",
  "5402":"Or, held in a snare. To deviate from Christ to the law is to be entangled or held in a snare. ",
  "5403":"The yoke of slavery is the bondage of the law, which makes the law keepers slaves under a binding yoke. ",
  "5404":"The Judaizers, the false brothers, made circumcision a condition of salvation (2:3-5; Acts 15:1). See note 3 in ch. 2. ",
  "5405":"If the Galatian believers had received circumcision, making it a condition of salvation, Christ would have profited them nothing, because by going back to the law they would have spontaneously relinquished Christ. ",
  "5406":"I.e., reduced to nothing, separated from Christ; deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him (Darby's New Translation), making Him of no effect. To go back to the law is to be severed from Christ, to be brought to nought, separated from Christ. ",
  "5407":"To be brought to nought, separated from Christ, is to fall from grace. This implies that the grace in which we believers are is just Christ. ",
  "5408":"In contrast to by the flesh (3:3). ",
  "5409":"In contrast to out of the works of law (3:2). ",
  "5410":"The righteousness we hope for, which is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). It is not in the flesh out of the works of law but in the Spirit out of faith. ",
  "5411":"I.e., has any force, any practical power. ",
  "5412":"Living faith is active. It operates through love to work out the fulfillment of the law (v. 14). Circumcision is simply an outward ordinance, having no power of life. Hence, it avails nothing. Faith receives the Spirit of life (3:2); thus, it is full of power. It operates through love to fulfill not only the law but also God's purpose, that is, to complete the sonship of God for His corporate expression &#151; the Body of Christ. ",
  "5413":"Love is related to our appreciation of Christ. Without such an appreciation, faith cannot operate. The hearing of faith awakens our loving appreciation, and the more we love the Lord, the more faith operates to bring us into the riches, the profit, of the all-inclusive Spirit. ",
  "5414":"Not the doctrine but the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by the apostle. ",
  "5415":"The Judaizers' persuasive teaching, which distracted the Galatians away from Christ to the observances of the law. ",
  "5416":"Leaven refers to the false teachings of the Judaizers (cf. Matt. 16:12), and the whole lump, to all the believers collectively, the church. ",
  "5417":"Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man's flesh; the cross is the reality of that dealing (Col. 2:11-12). The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality. ",
  "5418":"The apostle Paul wished that the Judaizers who upset the Galatians by insisting on circumcision would cut off not only their own foreskin but even themselves. Their upsetting, disturbing self needed to be amputated. ",
  "5419":"Freedom without limitation always results in the indulgence of the flesh. Freedom with limitation leads us to love others and, through love, to serve them as slaves (cf. v. 14). ",
  "5420":"See note 3 in ch. 3. ",
  "5421":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "5422":"The Greek word here means to tread all around, to walk at large; hence, to deport oneself, move, and act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk (cf. Rom. 6:4; 8:4; Phil. 3:17-18). ",
  "5423":"According to the context of the chapter, the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit from within our spirit. This is in contrast to having our walk regulated by the law in the realm of our flesh. See note 3 in ch. 3. <br><br>   The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man (Gen. 6:3), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God (John 7:39). Because of Christ's redemption and the Spirit's work of regeneration, we who have received God's dispensing can walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God, instead of by the flesh, by our fallen being. Paul wrote this book not only to rescue the distracted Galatian believers from the law, on the negative side, but also, on the positive side, to bring them into the realization that the believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their spirit that they may live, walk, and have their being in this Spirit. ",
  "5424":"For the flesh and the Spirit, see notes 3 in ch. 3 and 19 and 22 in this chapter. ",
  "5425":"See note 16. ",
  "5426":"See note 23 in Rom. 7. ",
  "5427":"The law is related to our flesh (Rom. 7:5), and our flesh is against the Spirit (v. 17). Hence, the Spirit is in contrast to the law. When we walk by the Spirit, who is in our regenerated spirit, we will not fulfill the lusts of our flesh (v. 16); when we are led by the Spirit, we are not under the law. The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit. ",
  "5428":"The flesh is the expression of the old Adam. The fallen life of the old Adam is expressed practically in the flesh, and the works of the flesh, such as those listed in vv. 19-21, are different aspects of such a fleshly expression. Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, bouts of drunkenness, and carousings are related to the lust of the corrupted body. Enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects, and envyings are related to the fallen soul, which is very closely related to the corrupted body. Idolatry and sorcery are related to the deadened spirit. This proves that the three parts of our fallen being &#151; body, soul, and spirit &#151; are all involved with the corrupted, evil flesh. ",
  "5429":"Fornication, uncleanness, and lasciviousness are of one group, concerning evil passions. ",
  "5430":"Idolatry and sorcery are of one group, concerning demonic worship. ",
  "5431":"Enmities, strife, jealousy, and outbursts of anger are of one group, concerning evil moods. ",
  "5432":"Factions, divisions, sects, and envyings are of one group, concerning parties. ",
  "5433":"The same Greek word as for heresies in 2 Pet. 2:1. Here it refers to schools of opinion (Darby's New Translation), or sects. ",
  "5434":"Bouts of drunkenness and carousings are of one group, concerning dissipation. ",
  "5435":"The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers. It is not the same as a believer's salvation; rather, it is a reward in addition to the believer's salvation. See notes 5 in Eph. 5 and 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "5436":"What the flesh does is works without life (v. 19); what the Spirit brings forth is fruit full of life. Only nine items of the fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit, who is life within us, are listed as illustrations here. The fruit of the Spirit includes additional items, such as lowliness (Eph. 4:2; Phil. 2:3), compassion (Phil. 2:1), godliness (2 Pet. 1:6), righteousness (Rom. 14:17; Eph. 5:9), holiness (Eph. 1:4; Col. 1:22), and purity (Matt. 5:8). In both Eph. 4:2 and Col. 3:12, lowliness is mentioned as a virtue in addition to meekness, which is listed here. In Rom. 14:17 righteousness, peace, and joy are all aspects of the kingdom of God today. But only peace and joy, not righteousness, are listed here. In 2 Pet. 1:5-7 godliness and endurance are counted with self-control and love as characteristics of spiritual growth, but they are not listed here. In Matt. 5:5-9 righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the requirement of the reality of the kingdom today. However, none of the three virtues is named here. <br><br>   As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Christ is actually lived out as the Spirit. The items of the fruit of the Spirit listed here are the very characteristics of Christ. ",
  "5437":"But in v. 22 introduces a contrast between the fruit of the Spirit in that verse and the works of the flesh in v. 19, whereas but in this verse introduces a contrast between the crucifying of the flesh here and the works of the flesh in v. 19. ",
  "5438":"The crucifixion of the old man in Rom. 6:6 and the crucifixion of the \"I\" in Gal. 2:20 were not accomplished by us. But here it says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. The old man and the \"I\" are our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man and the \"I\" is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifying of our flesh with its passions and its lusts is our practical experience of the fact. This practical experience must be carried out through the Spirit by our executing of the crucifixion that Christ accomplished. This is to put to death by the Spirit the practices of our lustful body with its evil members (Rom. 8:13b; Col. 3:5). <br><br>   There are three aspects of the experience of the cross: (1) the fact accomplished by Christ (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20); (2) our application of the accomplished fact (v. 24); and (3) our experience of what we have applied, by bearing the cross daily (Matt. 16:24; Luke 9:23). ",
  "5439":"This book unveils that the law misused is in opposition to Christ (2:16) and that the flesh lusts against the Spirit (v. 17). The cross has nullified the \"I,\" which inclines to keep the law (2:20), and the flesh, which lusts against the Spirit, that Christ may replace the law and the Spirit may replace the flesh. God does not want us to keep the law by the flesh; He wants us to live Christ by the Spirit. ",
  "5440":"To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent on and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law. This equals the walk by the Spirit in v. 16 but differs from the walk by the Spirit in this verse (see note 2). ",
  "5441":"Lit., walk according to rules. The Greek word means to observe the elements, to walk according to the elements, e.g., to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step; and, derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner (cf. 6:16; Acts 21:24; Rom. 4:12 and note; Phil. 3:16 and note 4). <br><br>   Both the walk in v. 16 and the walk in this verse are by the Spirit and are regulated by the Spirit. The former refers to a general, daily walk; the latter, to a walk that takes God's unique goal as the direction and purpose of life, and a walk that follows the Spirit as the elementary rule, the basic principle. Such a walk is cultivated by living in the new creation (6:16 and note 2), by pursuing Christ in order to gain Him (Phil. 3:12 and notes), and by practicing the church life (Rom. 12:1-5; Eph. 4:1-16), thus fulfilling God's intention in Christ for the church. ",
  "5442":"This is the result of the walk by the Spirit in v. 25. Vainglory, provoking, and envying are all of the flesh (cf. v. 24). Vainglory gives rise to provoking and envying. If we by the Spirit slay vainglory, provoking and envying will be terminated automatically, resulting in peace. These three matters test in a very practical way whether we are walking by the Spirit. ",
  "5443":"I.e., living and walking by the Spirit (5:25). ",
  "5444":"Our regenerated spirit, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. A spirit of meekness is the issue of living and walking by the Spirit, as mentioned in 5:16, 25. ",
  "5445":"The higher and better law of life, which works through love (Rom. 8:2; John 13:34). Love is the issue and expression of the divine life (cf. 1 Cor. 13) and is an item of the fruit of the Spirit (5:22). The law of Christ, which is the law of love, must be substantiated by the law of the Spirit of life that we may be able to bear one another's burdens. ",
  "5446":"Those who think of themselves as something will not bear the burdens of others. Only those who do not regard themselves as anything will bear others' burdens as a spontaneous result of walking in and by the Spirit. ",
  "5447":"Things that are good for this life, the necessities of daily living. ",
  "5448":"This refers again to the Judaizers' false teachings, which caused the Galatians to deviate from the Spirit in their spirit to the keeping of the law by their flesh. ",
  "5449":"With a view to, or, for. To sow unto one's own flesh is to sow for one's own flesh, with the desire and purpose of the flesh in view, to fulfill what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires. Everything we do is a sowing either unto our own flesh or unto the Spirit, and all our sowing issues in a reaping either of corruption out of the flesh or of eternal life out of the Spirit. ",
  "5450":"See notes 3 in ch. 3, and 19 and 22 in ch. 5. ",
  "5451":"To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself. ",
  "5452":"Lit., are not relaxed. ",
  "5453":"This refers mainly to the ministering of material things to the needy (2 Cor. 9:6-9). ",
  "5454":"The household of the faith refers to the children of promise (4:28), all who are sons of God through faith in Christ (3:26). All the believers in Christ together constitute a universal household, the great family of God. This is through faith in Christ, not through the works of law. This household, as the new man (Col. 3:10-11), is composed of all the members of Christ, with Christ as their constituent. Hence, we should do good, especially toward those of this household, regardless of their race and social rank (3:28). ",
  "5455":"See note 23 in ch. 1. ",
  "5456":"Perhaps this was because of the disease in Paul's eyes (4:13-15 and note 15 there). ",
  "5457":"Lit., good countenance; hence, good appearance for making a good show, a fair display. It is used here in a negative sense. <br><br>   Circumcision, like the cross, is not a good show but an abasement. However, the Judaizers made it a good show as a boast in the flesh (v. 13). ",
  "5458":"I.e., outwardly in the sphere of the flesh, which is condemned and repudiated by God. To be in the flesh is to be in our natural and external being without the inward reality and spiritual value that are in our regenerated spirit. ",
  "5459":"The cross was truly an abasement, but the apostle made it his boast. ",
  "5460":"The world has been crucified to us and we to the world. This has taken place not directly but through Christ, who was crucified. ",
  "5461":"The next verse, being an explanation of this verse, proves that the world here is mainly the religious world. In this book Paul dealt with religious people who were concerned for the things of God but who were misguided and were in error and whose religion had become a world. By the cross we are separated from the religious world and are thus qualified to live in the new creation. ",
  "5462":"The old creation is our old man in Adam (Eph. 4:22), our natural being by birth, without God's life and the divine nature. The new creation is the new man in Christ (Eph. 4:24), our being that is regenerated by the Spirit (John 3:6), having God's life and the divine nature wrought into it (John 3:36; 2 Pet. 1:4), having Christ as its constituent (Col. 3:10-11), and having become a new constitution. This refers to the nature, the inward and intrinsic organic constituent, of the church. Thus, the new creation is composed of sons; it is a corporate, divine sonship (3:26; 4:5, 7) brought forth through Christ's redemption, the Spirit's regeneration, and God's dispensing of Himself into us, and through our entering collectively as this new man into an organic union with the Triune God. <br><br>   The old creation was old because it did not have God's element; the new creation is new because it has God as its element. Although we are still the old creation, we experience the reality of the new creation when we walk according to the Spirit (5:16, 25). The main issue in this book is that we are the new creation and that we should live by the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God. This new creation fulfills God's eternal purpose, which is to express Himself in His sonship. <br><br>   Circumcision is an ordinance of the law; the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature. The former is of dead letters; the latter is of the living Spirit. Hence, the new creation is what matters. This book exposes the impotence of both the law and circumcision. The law cannot impart life (3:21) to regenerate us, and circumcision cannot energize us (5:6) to live a new creation. But the Son of God, who has been revealed in us (1:16), can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ, who lives in us (2:20), can afford us the riches of His life that we may live the new creation. The law has been replaced by Christ (2:19-20), and circumcision has been fulfilled by Christ's crucifixion (v. 14). Hence, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life is what matters. To be the new creation is the reason for and result of sowing unto the Spirit (v. 8). The keeping of the law and the practicing of circumcision are a sowing unto the flesh; they do not change the old creation. But sowing unto the Spirit makes us a new creation, which is re-created by the Spirit, transformed by the divine life, and constituted with the rich element of the processed Triune God by His mingling of Himself with us. ",
  "5463":"See note 25 in ch. 5. ",
  "5464":"The rule of being a new creation, of living by the Spirit through faith, having the Triune God as our life and living, in contrast to keeping the law by observing ordinances. To walk by this rule is to walk by the Spirit (5:25). ",
  "5465":"Paul opened this book with grace and peace (1:3), but he ended it with the mentioning of peace before mercy and grace (v. 18). Peace is the condition that results from grace. As we abide in a peaceful condition, we need to continue receiving mercy and grace. ",
  "5466":"I.e., the real Israel (Rom. 9:6b; 2:28-29; Phil. 3:3), including all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ, who are the true sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7, 29), who are the household of the faith (v. 10), and who are those in the new creation. They walk by \"this rule,\" express God's image, and execute God's authority, and are typified by Jacob, who was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor (Gen. 32:27-28). ",
  "5467":"The marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. With Paul, a slave of Christ (Rom. 1:1), the brands were physically the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master (2 Cor. 11:23-27). Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life that he lived, a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on this earth. Such a life is continually crucified (John 12:24), does the will of God (John 6:38), does not seek its own glory but the glory of God (John 7:18), and is submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8). The apostle followed the pattern of the Lord Jesus, bearing the brands, the characteristics of His life. In this he was absolutely different from the Judaizers. ",
  "5468":"The grace of Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God (who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit) enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit. ",
  "5469":"Our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit, who is the focus of God's promised blessing stressed so much throughout this book. It is in this spirit of ours that we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the central blessing of the New Testament. Hence, we need the grace of the Lord, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit (Phil. 1:19), to be with our spirit. <br><br>   Christ, the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit are the four basic items revealed in this book as the underlying thought of God's economy. Christ is the center of God's economy, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. When Christ is realized through the Spirit in our spirit, we become the new creation. Hence, our spirit is vital for us to live the life of the new creation for the fulfilling of God's purpose. <br><br>   This book places strong emphasis on the cross and the experience of crucifixion, in order to deal with the negative items, such as the law, the flesh, the \"I,\" the religious world, slavery, and the curse, thereby bringing in the positive items that are revealed in this book: Christ, the Spirit, the sons of God, the heirs of promise, the household of the faith, the new creation, and the Israel of God. The summarizing thought in this book is that through the cross of Christ the law, the flesh, and religion are terminated that we may obtain the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit, that through the Spirit, who is the realization of Christ, we may be the new creation in our spirit, bearing the brands of Jesus, and that we may enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit. ",
  "5470":"The rebuked foolish Galatians (3:1) had already been addressed with this intimate term a number of times (1:11; 3:15; 4:12, 28, 31; 5:11, 13; 6:1). At the close of such a severe, rebuking, and warning Epistle, the apostle used this loving term again, placing it particularly at the end of the sentence, to express his unchanging love toward them, assuring them that they were still his brothers in the household of the faith (v. 10). ",
  "5471":"This book speaks particularly of the church and unveils the church in its seven aspects as (1) the Body of Christ, the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all (v. 23; 4:13); (2) the new man (2:15), a corporate man, having not only the life of Christ but also His person; (3) the kingdom of God (2:19), with the saints as citizens possessing its rights and bearing its responsibilities; (4) the household of God (2:19), a family full of life and enjoyment; (5) the dwelling place of God, in which He may live (2:21-22) &#151; universally, a holy temple in the Lord, and locally, the dwelling place of God in our spirit; (6) the bride, the wife, of Christ (5:24-25) for Christ's rest and satisfaction; and (7) the warrior (6:11-12), a corporate fighter, who deals with and defeats God's enemy to accomplish God's eternal purpose. <br><br>   A particular characteristic of this book is that it speaks from the viewpoint of God's eternal purpose, from eternity, and from the heavenlies. It is positioned in the New Testament immediately after the revelation concerning Christ versus religion (Galatians). It is followed by a book on the practical experience of Christ (Philippians), and it leads to Christ, the Head (Colossians). Thus, these four books are the heart of the New Testament revelation concerning God's eternal economy. ",
  "5472":"Paul was made an apostle of Christ not by man but through the will of God, according to God's economy. This standing gave him authority to put forth in this Epistle the revelation of God's eternal purpose concerning the church. The church is built on this revelation (2:20). ",
  "5473":"The saints are those who are made holy, who are sanctified, separated unto God from everything that is common. ",
  "5474":"In Ephesus is not found in the earliest MSS. ",
  "5475":"The faithful are those who are faithful in the faith, which is referred to in 4:13; 2 Tim. 4:7; and Jude 3. ",
  "5476":"Grace is God as our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10). ",
  "5477":"Peace is a condition that issues from grace, from the enjoyment of God our Father. ",
  "5478":"We are God's creatures and God's sons. To us as God's creatures, God is our God; to us as God's sons, He is our Father. ",
  "5479":"We are also the Lord's redeemed ones. As the Lord's redeemed ones, we have Him as our Lord. Grace and peace come to us from God our Creator, from our Father, and from the Lord our Redeemer. Since we are His created ones, redeemed ones, and regenerated ones, we are positioned to receive grace and peace from Him. ",
  "5480":"Lit., well spoken of; i.e., praised with adoration. In this section the Triune God is well spoken of, praised with adoration: the Father in His selection and predestination for God's eternal purpose (vv. 3-6), the Son in His redemption for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose (vv. 7-12), and the Spirit in His sealing and pledging for the application of God's accomplished purpose (vv. 13-14). Through all the virtues of the Divine Trinity, we, the fallen sinners, become the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all. ",
  "5481":"God is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, and God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God. According to the Lord's humanity, God is His God, and according to the Lord's divinity, God is His Father. ",
  "5482":"Since the Lord Jesus is ours, whatever God is to Him also is ours. Lord refers to His lordship (Acts 2:36), Jesus to Him as a man (1 Tim. 2:5), and Christ to Him as God's anointed One (John 20:31). ",
  "5483":"Lit., praised, or, spoken well of. When God blesses us, He praises us, speaks well of us. ",
  "5484":"Lit., in. ",
  "5485":"All the blessings with which God has blessed us, being spiritual, are related to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God is not only the channel but also the reality of God's blessings. In this verse God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are all related to the blessings bestowed on us. God's blessing us is actually His dispensing Himself into us. ",
  "5486":"Lit., good speech, or, utterance, well speaking, fair speech; implying bounty and benefit. God has blessed us with His good, fine, and fair speakings. Every such speaking is a blessing to us. Verses 4-14 are an account of such speakings, such blessings. All these blessings are spiritual, in the heavenlies, and in Christ. ",
  "5487":"Heavenlies here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere of the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us. These blessings are from the heavens, having a heavenly nature, heavenly state, heavenly characteristic, and heavenly atmosphere. The believers in Christ are enjoying on earth these heavenly blessings, which are spiritual as well as heavenly. They are different from the blessings with which God blessed Israel. Those blessings were physical and earthly. The blessings bestowed on us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies. They are the spiritual blessings bestowed by the Triune God on us, the believers in Christ. They are the blessings in the heavenlies, having a heavenly nature, state, character, and atmosphere. ",
  "5488":"Christ is the virtue, the instrument, and the sphere in which God has blessed us. Outside of Christ, apart from Christ, God has nothing to do with us; but in Christ He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies. ",
  "5489":"After v. 3, vv. 4-14 present a list of all the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us, beginning from His choosing us in eternity and reaching to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity. Hence, God's choosing is the first blessing that He bestowed on us. His choosing is His selection. From among numberless people He selected us, and this He did in Christ. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God's choice. ",
  "5490":"This was in eternity past. Before He created us, God chose us according to His infinite foresight. This implies that the world, which is the universe, was founded for man's existence to fulfill God's eternal purpose. <br><br>   The book of Romans begins with fallen men on earth; Ephesians begins with God's chosen ones in the heavenlies. ",
  "5491":"Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature. He chose us that we should be holy. He makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God's divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This is different from mere sinless perfection or sinless purity. This makes our being holy in God's nature and character, just like God Himself. ",
  "5492":"A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem. God's chosen ones should be saturated with only God Himself, having no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things. This is to be without blemish, without any mixture, without any element other than God's holy nature. The church, after being thoroughly washed by the water in the word, will be sanctified in such a way (5:26-27). ",
  "5493":"Before Him indicates that we are holy and without blemish in the eyes of God according to His divine standard. This qualifies us to remain in and enjoy His presence. ",
  "5494":"In love could be joined with the first phrase of v. 5. ",
  "5495":"Love here refers to the love with which God loves His chosen ones and His chosen ones love Him. It is in this love, in such a love, that God's chosen ones become holy and without blemish before Him. First, God loved us; then this divine love inspires us to love Him in return. In such a condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be holy and without blemish, just as He is. ",
  "5496":"Or, marking us out beforehand. Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose, which is to determine a destiny beforehand. God selected us before the foundation of the world, marking us out beforehand unto a certain destiny. ",
  "5497":"God's marking us out beforehand was to destine us unto sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God's creatures we need to be regenerated by Him that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies having not only the life but also the position of a son. God's marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and the position to inherit Him. To be made holy &#151; to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us &#151; is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to a particular form or shape, the very image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:15), that our whole being, including our body (Rom. 8:23), may be \"sonized\" by God. ",
  "5498":"Through Jesus Christ means through the Son of God, the Redeemer. Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God, having the life and position of God's sons. ",
  "5499":"This reveals that God has a will, in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to His pleasure, according to His heart's delight. Unlike the book of Romans, the book of Ephesians does not speak from the standpoint of man's sinful condition; rather, it speaks from the standpoint of the good pleasure of God's heart. Hence, Ephesians is deeper and higher. ",
  "5500":"The praise of the glory of God's grace is the result, the issue, of sonship (v. 5). God's predestinating us unto sonship is for the praise of His expression in His grace, that is, for the praise of the glory of His grace. Eventually, every positive thing in the universe will praise God for sonship (Rom. 8:19), thus fulfilling what is spoken in this verse. ",
  "5501":"Glory is God expressed (Exo. 40:34). The glory of His grace indicates that God's grace, which is Himself as our enjoyment, expresses Him. As we receive grace and enjoy God, we have the sense of glory. ",
  "5502":"This puts us into the position of grace that we may be the object of God's grace and favor, that is, that we may enjoy all that God is to us. ",
  "5503":"The Beloved is God's beloved Son, in whom He delights (Matt. 3:17; 17:5). Hence, in gracing us God makes us an object in whom He delights. This is altogether a pleasure to God. In Christ we have been blessed by God with every blessing. In the Beloved we were graced, made the object of God's favor and pleasure. As such an object we enjoy God, and God enjoys us in His grace in His Beloved, who is His delight. In His Beloved we too become His delight. ",
  "5504":"We were chosen and predestinated. But after being created, we became fallen. Hence, we need redemption, which God accomplished for us in Christ through His blood. This is another item of God's blessings that He has bestowed on us. ",
  "5505":"The forgiveness of our offenses is the redemption through the blood of Christ. Apart from the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is the application of Christ's accomplishment to our offenses. ",
  "5506":"God's grace is not only rich (v. 7) but also abounding. Such grace makes us an inheritance to God (v. 11) and qualifies us to inherit all that God is (v. 14). ",
  "5507":"Wisdom is what is within God for planning and purposing a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God's wisdom. First, God planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied with prudence what He had planned and purposed for us. Wisdom was mainly for God's plan in eternity, and prudence is mainly for God's execution of His plan in time. What God planned in eternity in His wisdom, He is now executing in time in His prudence. ",
  "5508":"To make known to us the mystery of His will is one item of God's wisdom and prudence. ",
  "5509":"In eternity God planned a will. This will was hidden in Him; hence, it was a mystery. In His wisdom and prudence He has made this hidden mystery known to us through His revelation in Christ, that is, through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. ",
  "5510":"It was the pleasure of God's heart to make the mystery of His will known to us. ",
  "5511":"God's good pleasure was what He purposed in Himself unto the economy of the fullness of the times (v. 10), indicating that God Himself is the initiation, the origination, and the sphere of His eternal purpose, which nothing can overthrow, for which everything is working, and regarding which He did not take counsel with anyone. ",
  "5512":"Or, plan. The Greek word, oikonomia, means house law, household management or administration, and derivatively, administrative dispensation, plan, economy (see note 4 in 1 Tim. 1). The economy that God, according to His desire, planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times. This is accomplished through the dispensing of the abundant life supply of the Triune God as the life factor into all the members of the church that they may rise up from the death situation and be attached to the Body. ",
  "5513":"The times refers to the ages. The fullness of the times will be when the new heaven and new earth appear after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed. Altogether there are four ages: the age of sin (Adam), the age of the law (Moses), the age of grace (Christ), and the age of the kingdom (the millennium). ",
  "5514":"God made Christ the Head over all things (v. 22). Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth. That will be God's eternal administration and economy. Thus, the heading up of all things is the issue of all the items covered in vv. 3-9. Verse 22 reveals further that this heading up is to the church so that the Body of Christ may share in all that is of Christ as the Head, having been rescued from the heap of the universal collapse in death and darkness, which was caused by the rebellion of the angels and the rebellion of man. The believers participate in this heading up by being willing to be headed up in the church life, by growing in life, and by living under Christ's light (John 1:4; Rev. 21:23-25). When everything is headed up in Christ, there will be absolute peace and harmony (Isa. 2:4; 11:6; 55:12; Psa. 96:12-13), a full rescue out of the collapse. This will begin from the time of the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21). ",
  "5515":"Lit., the Christ. Referring to the One mentioned in v. 1 and v. 3, the One in whom are the spiritual blessings of God and in whom are the faithful saints, who participate in the blessings. He is a particular One; hence, He is called \"the Christ.\" So also in vv. 12 and 20. ",
  "5516":"Or, have obtained an inheritance. The Greek verb means to choose or assign by lot. Hence, this clause literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance. We were designated as an inheritance to inherit God as our inheritance. On the one hand, we have become God's inheritance (v. 18) for God's enjoyment; on the other hand, we inherit God as our inheritance (v. 14) for our enjoyment. ",
  "5517":"Or, marked out beforehand. See note 5. ",
  "5518":"I.e., plan. ",
  "5519":"God's will is His intention; God's counsel is His consideration of the way to accomplish His will or intention. ",
  "5520":"So much will be worked out by God's abounding grace for and in the believers, the sons of God, who are the center of God's work in the universe, that all the angels and positive things in the universe will praise God and appreciate God's expression (glory). This will take place mainly in the millennium and ultimately in the new heaven and new earth. ",
  "5521":"Or, before. We, the New Testament believers, are those who have first hoped in Christ, that is, in this age. The Jews will have their hope in Christ in the next age. We have hoped in Christ before He comes back to set up His Messianic kingdom. ",
  "5522":"To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. We have been designated as God's inheritance (v. 11). At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God. ",
  "5523":"Of the promise indicates that God planned according to His pleasure to seal us with His Spirit. ",
  "5524":"Or, foretaste, guarantee. I.e., token payment; a partial payment in advance, guaranteeing the full payment. Since we are God's inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge to us of this inheritance. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance. In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchasing of land. The seller gave the purchaser some soil as a sample from the land. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we will inherit of God in full. ",
  "5525":"See note 32 in Acts 20. So also in v. 18. ",
  "5526":"Unto the redemption of the acquired possession gives the purpose of the sealing in v. 13. The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God's divine element until we are mature in God's life and eventually fully redeemed, even in our body. ",
  "5527":"Redemption here refers to the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance, until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we will inherit God in full. The span of God's blessings bestowed on us covers all the crucial points from God's selection in eternity past (v. 4) to the redemption of our body for eternity future. ",
  "5528":"We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession, which He acquired with the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28). In God's economy, God becomes our inheritance and we become God's possession. How marvelous! We give nothing and we get everything! God acquired us at a cost, but we inherit God at no cost. This is to the praise of God's glory. ",
  "5529":"This is the third time a phrase like this is used, this time as an ending to this section (vv. 3-14) concerning God's blessings given to us. Verses 3-6 disclose what God the Father planned for us, that is, to choose us and predestinate us unto sonship to the praise of the glory of His grace. Verses 7-12 reveal how God the Son accomplished what God the Father planned, that is, to redeem us and make us God's inheritance to the praise of His glory. Verses 13-14 tell us how God the Spirit applies to us what God the Son accomplished, that is, to seal us and be the guarantee and foretaste of our eternal, divine inheritance to the praise of God's glory. In the blessings God bestows on us, the glory of the Triune God deserves the threefold praise. ",
  "5530":"Many ancient MSS read, the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and which you have toward all the saints. ",
  "5531":"In incarnation the Lord Jesus Christ, God Himself (Phil. 2:6), became a man. As a man He is related to God's creation; therefore, God the Creator is His God. His incarnation brought God the Creator into man, God's creature. He is a man in whom God is incarnated. ",
  "5532":"The title Father implies regeneration, and glory is God expressed. Hence, the Father of glory is the regenerating God expressed through His many sons. We have already been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3), and we will be glorified in the expression of God's glory (Rom. 8:30). ",
  "5533":"The spirit here must be our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Such a spirit is given to us by God that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy. ",
  "5534":"Wisdom is in our spirit that we may know the mystery of God, and revelation is of God's Spirit that He may show us the vision by opening the veil. First, we have wisdom, the ability to understand, which enables us to know spiritual things; then the Spirit of God reveals the spiritual things to our spiritual understanding. ",
  "5535":"Eyes to see the spiritual things. We have wisdom, the ability to know, and revelation, the revealing of spiritual things. However, we still need eyes, the spiritual faculty of sight (Acts 26:18; Rev. 3:18). <br><br>   To have the eyes of our heart enlightened requires that our conscience, mind, emotion, and will, which are the components of our heart, be thoroughly dealt with (cf. note 17 in ch. 3). First, we need an open spirit with a conscience purified by our confessing and dealing with our sins and by the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14; 10:22). Next, we need a sober mind (2 Tim. 1:7 and note 2), a loving emotion (John 14:21), and a submissive will (John 7:17) in order to have a pure heart. When we have such a spirit and heart, the eyes of our heart will be able to see. ",
  "5536":"We not only need wisdom, revelation, and eyes to see, but we also need light for the illumination of the things which are unveiled to us, that we may have a vision. ",
  "5537":"The hope of God's calling includes (1) Christ Himself and the salvation He will bring to us when He comes back (Col. 1:27; 1 Pet. 1:5, 9); (2) the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly and spiritual sphere, plus glorification (Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21); (3) the kingly enjoyment with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:18); and (4) the consummate enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem, with the universal and eternal blessings in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5). ",
  "5538":"God's calling is the sum total of all the blessings listed in vv. 3-14: God the Father's selection and predestination, God the Son's redemption, and God the Spirit's sealing and pledging. When we were called, we participated in the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging. ",
  "5539":"God's glory has its riches, which are the many different items that constitute God's divine attributes, such as light, life, power, love, righteousness, and holiness, expressed to different degrees. ",
  "5540":"First, God made us His inheritance (v. 11a) as His acquired possession (v. 14b) and caused us to participate in all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has accomplished, as our inheritance (v. 14a). Ultimately, all these will become His inheritance in the saints for eternity. This will be His eternal expression, His glory with all His riches, which will express Him to the uttermost universally and eternally. ",
  "5541":"According to the apostle's prayer, the third thing we need to know is the surpassing greatness of God's power toward us. This is very subjective and experiential to us today. God's power toward us is surpassingly great. We need to know it and experience it. ",
  "5542":"The surpassingly great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ. God's power toward us is the same as the power that He caused to operate in Christ. Christ is the Head and we are the Body. The Body participates in the power that operates in the Head. ",
  "5543":"First, the power that God caused to operate in Christ raised Christ from the dead. This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, where the dead are held. Death and Hades could not hold Christ (Acts 2:24) because of God's resurrection power. ",
  "5544":"Second, the power that God caused to operate in Christ seated Christ at God's right hand in the heavenlies, far above all (v. 21). ",
  "5545":"God's right hand, where Christ was seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. ",
  "5546":"The heavenlies refers not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God's power. ",
  "5547":"Rule refers to the highest office, authority to every kind of official power (Matt. 8:9), power to the mere might of authority, and lordship to the preeminence that power establishes. Subsequently, we see that what is listed here includes not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, whether good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ was seated by the great power of God far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe. ",
  "5548":"Every name that is named refers not only to titles of honor but also to every name. Christ was seated far above every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.",
  "5549":"Third, the power that God caused to operate in Christ subjected all things under His feet. Christ's being far above all is one thing; His having all things subjected under His feet is another. The former is Christ's transcendency; the latter, the subjection of all things to Him. ",
  "5550":"Fourth, God's power that He caused to operate in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Christ's headship over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God's surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the universe. <br><br>   It was as a man, in His humanity with His divinity, that Christ was raised from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things. <br><br>   Thus, there are four aspects of the power that operated in Christ: resurrection power (v. 20a), ascending power (v. 20b), subjecting power (v. 22a), and heading-up power (v. 22b). This fourfold power is transmitted to the church, the Body of the Head. ",
  "5551":"To the church implies a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments: the resurrection from the dead, His being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things. <br><br>   Toward us who believe (v. 19) and to the church indicate that the divine power, which includes all that the Triune God has passed through, has been installed into us once for all and is being transmitted into us continually, causing us to enjoy Christ richly and to have the proper church life as His Body, His fullness, the issue of God's blessing mentioned previously. ",
  "5552":"Here this book uses the term church for the first time, pointing out the main subject of this book. The Greek word for church is ekklesia, meaning the called-out congregation. This indicates that the church is a gathering of those who have been called out of the world by God. As such, the church is composed of all the believers in Christ. ",
  "5553":"The Body of Christ is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head. The Body of Christ is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who has come into the church. By means of the ascended Christ's heavenly transmission, we are made one with Him, and thus His Body is produced. ",
  "5554":"The Body of Christ is His fullness. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ (3:8). Through the enjoyment of Christ's riches, we become His fullness to express Him. ",
  "5555":"Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression. <br><br>   In this chapter there are seven crucial things requiring the same basic factor for their accomplishment: God's selection that we should be made holy and without blemish (v. 4); God's predestination that we may become His sons (v. 5); the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we may be fully redeemed (vv. 13-14); the hope of God's calling; the glory of God's inheritance in the saints (v. 18); God's power that causes us to participate in Christ's attainment (vv. 19-22); and the Body of Christ, the fullness of the all-filling Christ. All these are accomplished by the Triune God being dispensed and wrought into our being. The issue of such a divine dispensing into our humanity is the fullness of the One who fills all in all and the praise of God's expressed glory. Actually, this chapter is a revelation of God's marvelous and excellent economy, from His choosing of us in eternity to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity. ",
  "5556":"Grammatically, and indicates that the thought in the last sentence of ch. 1 is incomplete. The last verse of ch. 1 reveals that the church, the Body of Christ, was produced by Christ through His attainment. Now this chapter unveils to us the background &#151; the realm of death &#151; from which the church was brought forth. In ch. 1 the church is the issue of the transmission of the heavenly divinity into us. In this chapter the church comes out of the earthly humanity. ",
  "5557":"Dead refers to the deadness of our spirit, which pervaded our entire being and caused us to lose the function that enables us to contact God. ",
  "5558":"Offenses are acts that overstep the limit of one's rights. Sins are evil doings. Before we were saved, we were dead in offenses and sins. It was from this background of death that we were saved to be the church, the Body of Christ. The dead have been made alive to be a living organism to express Christ. ",
  "5559":"This world refers to the satanic system, which is composed of many ages. Hence, the age here refers to a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. When we were dead in offenses and sins, we walked according to the age, the modern appearance, the present course, of the world, the satanic system. ",
  "5560":"Referring to Satan, the prince of the rulers and authorities in the air mentioned in 6:12. ",
  "5561":"The spirit, in apposition to the authority of the air, refers to the aggregate power, the aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities, over which Satan is the ruler. This aggregate spirit is now operating in the sons of disobedience. When we were dead in offenses and sins, we walked not only according to the age of this world but also according to Satan, the ruler of the aerial authority, the evil spiritual power. ",
  "5562":"We, the sons of disobedience, have been saved to be the church.",
  "5563":"Referring to the sons of disobedience in v. 2. ",
  "5564":"Referring to all believers, both Jewish and Gentile. ",
  "5565":"When we were dead in offenses and sins, we conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires not only of the flesh but also of the thoughts. Three evil things &#151; the age of this world, which is outside of us; the ruler of the aerial authority, which is above and within us; and the lusts of our flesh in our fallen nature &#151; dominated our lives. From these evil things we have been saved to be the Body of Christ. ",
  "5566":"As the sons of disobedience, we were also the children of wrath. In the realm of death we were under God's wrath because of our disobedience. We have been saved from both our disobedience and God's wrath. ",
  "5567":"But God points to the factor that changed our position. ",
  "5568":"The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation. Hence, God's mercy reaches farther than His love. God loves us because we are the object of His selection. But because of our fall we became pitiful, even dead in our offenses and sins; therefore, we need God's mercy. Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us out of our wretched position into a condition that is suitable for His love. ",
  "5569":"Or, abundant love &#151; abundantly great love. ",
  "5570":"In comparison with the book of Romans, the book of Ephesians does not consider us sinners; it considers us dead persons. As sinners, we need God's forgiveness and justification, as revealed in the book of Romans. But as dead persons, we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God's presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive causes us, the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (Col. 3:4), into our dead spirit through His Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). He has enlivened us together with Christ. ",
  "5571":"God enlivened us together when He enlivened the crucified Jesus. Therefore, He made us alive together with Christ. ",
  "5572":"See note 10 in ch. 1. ",
  "5573":"Grace is free. Here it denotes not only God freely dispensed into us for our enjoyment but also God's action in freely saving us. By such grace we have been saved out of our wretched position of death into the marvelous realm of life. ",
  "5574":"We were saved not only as sinners but also as dead persons, and not only by Christ's death with its redemption but also by His resurrection with its resurrection life, and even by His ascension with its transcendency. This is the transcending salvation given to the dead sinners by the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very embodiment of the processed Triune God. Such a salvation produces the church as the issue of the processed Divine Trinity for His expression. ",
  "5575":"To make us alive is the initial step of God's salvation in life. After this, God raised us up from the position of death. ",
  "5576":"From our standpoint we have been raised up from our position of death one by one. But in God's view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea (Exo. 14). ",
  "5577":"The third step of God's salvation in life is to seat us together in the heavenlies. God not only raised us up from the position of death, but He also seated us in the highest place in the universe. ",
  "5578":"The heavenlies are the highest position, into which we have been saved in Christ. In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness brought us into a state in which we are acceptable to God. In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God's enemies. Here in the heavenly atmosphere, with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people. ",
  "5579":"It was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies. This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it has been applied to us by the Spirit of Christ ever since we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact. ",
  "5580":"I.e., exhibit to the whole universe publicly. ",
  "5581":"The ages of the millennium and eternity future. These come after the present age, in which the church is produced. ",
  "5582":"The riches of God's grace surpass every limit. These are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment. They will be publicly displayed for eternity.",
  "5583":"Kindness is a benevolent goodness that issues out of mercy and love. It is in such kindness that the grace of God is given to us. ",
  "5584":"For introduces the reason that God displays His grace (v. 7). Because we have been saved by His grace, God can display it. ",
  "5585":"Grace is God dispensed into us. Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by having the processed Triune God dispensed into us. ",
  "5586":"Faith is the substantiation of invisible things (Heb. 11:1). It is by faith that we substantiate all the things Christ has accomplished for us. Through such a substantiating ability, we have been saved by grace. The free action of God's grace saved us through our substantiating faith. This faith of ours is the faith by which we believe in Christ, and it is Christ in us as our faith (see note 22 in Rom. 3). ",
  "5587":"This does not refer to faith but to the matter that \"by grace you have been saved through faith.\" ",
  "5588":"The Greek word, poiema, means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem. Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design. We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are a poem expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design. <br><br>   The heavens, the earth, and man, created by God, are not God's masterpiece; but the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23), the corporate and universal new man (v. 15), is a masterpiece. We have been saved by grace to be God's masterpiece that we may walk in the good works prepared beforehand by God. ",
  "5589":"We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention of God. We were created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). ",
  "5590":"The good works for which God created us are not the good things that are according to our general concept but the definite good doings that God preplanned and preordained for us to walk in. These good things must be the doing of His will that we may live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus, as revealed in the succeeding chapters of this book. ",
  "5591":"The man whom God created to fulfill His purpose was pure, without sin or any kind of negative mixture. However, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into man through the fall. First, it caused man's body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually, it made the whole being of man the flesh. Hence, man was damaged and was thus prevented from fulfilling God's purpose. Then God came in to call a race &#151; Abraham and his descendants &#151; out of fallen mankind. For the accomplishing of His purpose, God commanded them to be circumcised, that is, to put away their flesh. This meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition. Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind. The circumcised people were called \"the circumcision,\" those who were separated from the fallen situation. The rest of mankind was called \"the uncircumcision,\" those who remained in the fallen state. These were the Gentiles in the flesh. We were in this category before we were in Christ. ",
  "5592":"Christ, in whom all God's blessings to His chosen people are embodied, came out of Israel, the circumcised people. Since we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were separated from Israel, we were apart from Christ, having nothing to do with Christ. ",
  "5593":"That is, the citizenship, the civil rights, of God's chosen people, such as God's ruling, blessing, and presence. Through the fall, mankind lost all the rights that God intended for man in His creation. God called Abraham and through circumcision brought His chosen people back to all these rights. We, as uncircumcised Gentiles, remained alienated from such rights. ",
  "5594":"God's covenants are His promises. His promise is His word that He will freely do certain things for His chosen people. When His promise is made into law by the necessary procedures, it becomes a binding covenant. All the words God spoke to His chosen people, from Abraham to Malachi, were His promises made into law to be His covenants. We, the Gentiles, not only are alienated from the commonwealth of Israel but also are strangers to the covenants of God's promise. ",
  "5595":"All God's blessings are contained in Christ, all the civil rights are related to the nation of Israel, and all good things are promised in God's covenants. Since we were apart from Christ, were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and were strangers to the covenants of God's promise, we had no hope whatever. ",
  "5596":"God is in Christ; He rules and moves in the commonwealth of Israel; and He bestows His blessings according to His covenants. When we were apart from Christ, the commonwealth of Israel, and the covenants of God's promise, we were without God; we did not have God as our enjoyment. ",
  "5597":"The world, which is the system of Satan, is in contrast to the commonwealth of Israel. The commonwealth of Israel was the kingdom of God, whereas the world is the kingdom of Satan. Before we were saved, we lived in the world, where we had no hope as our expectation and no God as our enjoyment; we were empty both in the present age and in relation to the coming age. ",
  "5598":"But now is a precious phrase, indicating that now in Christ we have hope and that we also have God. ",
  "5599":"I.e., far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God's promise. This equals being far off from God and all His blessings. ",
  "5600":"I.e., near to Christ, to Israel, and to God's promise. This equals being near to God and all His blessings. ",
  "5601":"We were far off because we were fallen. But the redeeming blood of Christ brought us back. Hence, in this blood we have become near both to Israel and to God. ",
  "5602":"Our refers to the Jewish and the Gentile believers. ",
  "5603":"Christ, who accomplished full redemption for both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, making both one. Because of the fall of mankind and the calling of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ's redemption this separation has been removed. Now, in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, both are one. ",
  "5604":"Both refers to the Jewish and the Gentile believers. ",
  "5605":"The middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances in v. 15, which was instituted because of man's flesh. The first ordinance was circumcision, the cutting off of man's flesh. This became the middle wall of partition between the circumcision and the uncircumcision. ",
  "5606":"The middle wall of partition, which is the distinction (made mainly by circumcision) between the circumcision and the uncircumcision, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles. ",
  "5607":"Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. When He was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there (Col. 2:14). ",
  "5608":"Because mankind became flesh (Gen. 6:3) and was therefore kept from God and His purpose, God ordained that His chosen people be circumcised, that they put away the flesh. The ordinance of circumcision was instituted because of man's flesh. It was in the flesh that Christ was crucified. When He was crucified, His flesh, which was typified by the veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the temple, was rent (Heb. 10:20). ",
  "5609":"This is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of the ritual commandments, composed principally of the practice of circumcision, the observance of dietary regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath. These ordinances were the main \"columns\" of Judaism. The moral commandments will never be abolished, but the ritual commandments were in force only during a particular time dispensationally and are therefore not permanent. ",
  "5610":"I.e., rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. To practice the proper church life, all ordinances should be repudiated and dropped. ",
  "5611":"Christ created the one new man, the church, by working God's divine nature into humanity. The working of the divine nature into humanity was something new. Hence, it was a creating. In the old creation God did not work His nature into any of His creatures, not even into man. In the creating of the one new man, however, God's nature was wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity. ",
  "5612":"Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the means by which the one new man was created. He is the very element of the new man, making God's divine nature one entity with humanity. The Greek word rendered in here can also have an elemental significance, meaning also with, implying that the new man was created with Christ as its divine essence. ",
  "5613":"The Jews and the Gentiles were separated to the uttermost by the separating ordinances. But both were created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, which is a corporate man, the church. ",
  "5614":"The church is not only the church of God, the Body of Christ (the fullness, the expression, of the all-filling One &#151; 1:23), and the household or family, the house, the temple, and the dwelling place of God (2:19, 21-22); it is also the one new man, which is corporate and universal, created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, and composed of all the believers, who, though they are many, are one new man in the universe. <br><br>   God created man as a collective entity (Gen. 1:26). The corporate man created by God was damaged through man's fall; hence, there was the need for God to produce a new man. This was accomplished through Christ's abolishing in His flesh the ordinances and through His creating of the new man in Himself. ",
  "5615":"By Christ's abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances, that is, His slaying the enmity, and by His creating the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers. ",
  "5616":"Both refers to the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only the uncircumcised Gentiles but also the circumcised Jews needed to be reconciled to God through the redemption of Christ, accomplished on His cross. ",
  "5617":"This one Body, the church (1:23), is the one new man mentioned in the previous verse. It was in this one Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross. We, the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ but also in the Body of Christ. What a revelation here! We were reconciled to God; we were saved in the Body of Christ. ",
  "5618":"We were without God and we had lost God (v. 12). But through the cross, with the blood of Christ, we have been brought back to God in the one Body. ",
  "5619":"On the one hand, the cross of Christ slew the enmity caused by the ordinances, which were instituted because of the flesh, and on the other hand, it redeemed us with the blood of Christ, which was shed upon it. It was through the cross that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled in one Body to God. ",
  "5620":"This is the breaking down of the middle wall of partition and the abolishing of the ordinances that bring in discord between the Jews and the Gentiles, as mentioned in vv. 14-15. ",
  "5621":"Or, in Him.",
  "5622":"This is the coming of Christ as the Spirit to preach peace as the gospel, which peace He made through His cross. ",
  "5623":"Referring to the Gentiles, who were uncircumcised and were far off, separated by their flesh. ",
  "5624":"Referring to the Jews, who were circumcised and were near, made nigh by God's choosing. ",
  "5625":"Both the Jewish and the Gentile believers have access to the Father through Christ, who abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, broke down the middle wall of partition, slew the enmity to reconcile the Gentiles to the Jews, and shed His blood to redeem the Jews and the Gentiles to God. ",
  "5626":"The access is constituted of Christ's cross and His blood (Heb. 10:19). ",
  "5627":"First, both the Jewish and the Gentile believers were reconciled in one Body to God (v. 16). That was a positional matter. Then they both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. This is experiential. In order to enjoy experientially what we possess positionally, we need to be in the Spirit. ",
  "5628":"Positionally, we were reconciled to God; experientially, we have access unto the Father. To be reconciled to God is to be saved; to have access unto the Father is to enjoy God, who, as the source of life, regenerated us to be His sons. <br><br>   Here the trinity of the Godhead is implied. Through God the Son, who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit, who is the Executor, the application, we have access unto God the Father, who is the Originator, the source of our enjoyment. ",
  "5629":"Referring to the Gentile believers. ",
  "5630":"Strangers are aliens, and sojourners are foreigners sojourning among Israel without rights of citizenship. Here both refer to the Gentiles. ",
  "5631":"Fellow citizens with the saints indicates the kingdom of God. All the believers, Jewish and Gentile, are citizens in God's kingdom. God's kingdom is a sphere in which He exercises His authority. ",
  "5632":"Members of the household of God indicates the house of God. Both the Jewish and the Gentile believers are members of God's house. God's house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers are born of God into His house to enjoy His riches. God's kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility; all believers born into the house of God have the civil rights of and obligations in the kingdom of God. The saints are individuals; the house of God is corporate and issues in the kingdom of God. ",
  "5633":"As the Body of Christ, the church has been regenerated and needs the growth in life; as the house of God, the church is being built. Growth and building are not separate things, for the growth of the Body is the building of the house. ",
  "5634":"The foundation of the church is Christ (1 Cor. 3:11). Because the mystery of Christ was revealed to the apostles (3:5-6), the revelation they received is considered the foundation on which the church is built. This corresponds with the rock in Matt. 16:18, which is not only Christ but also the revelation concerning Christ, on which Christ will build His church. Therefore, the foundation of the apostles and prophets is the revelation they received for the building of the church. ",
  "5635":"Here, Christ is referred to not as the foundation (Isa. 28:16) but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers, and the other, the Gentile believers. Here, not Christ but the apostles and prophets who received the revelation concerning Christ are stressed as the foundation. When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone (Acts 4:11; 1 Pet. 2:7), the One who would join the Gentiles to them for the building of God's house. ",
  "5636":"In Christ, who is the cornerstone, all the building, including both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is fitted together and is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. ",
  "5637":"Or, every building. ",
  "5638":"I.e., made suitable for the condition and situation of the building. ",
  "5639":"Since the building is living (1 Pet. 2:5), it is growing. It grows into a holy temple. The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the believers' growth in life. ",
  "5640":"Or, sanctuary; the inner part of the temple. ",
  "5641":"The entire building of God's house, God's sanctuary, is in Christ the Lord. ",
  "5642":"Referring to the local saints. ",
  "5643":"Also indicates that the building in v. 21 is universal and that the building in this verse is local. Universally, the church is uniquely one and is growing universally; locally, the church in a particular locality also is one, and the local saints are being built together in their particular locality. ",
  "5644":"According to the context, in v. 21 the holy temple is universal; in this verse the dwelling place of God is local. ",
  "5645":"The believers' human spirit, which is indwelt by God's Holy Spirit. God's Spirit is the Dweller, not the dwelling place. The dwelling place is the believers' spirit. God's Spirit dwells in our spirit. Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit. Verse 21 says that the holy temple is in the Lord, and this verse, that the dwelling place of God is in spirit. This indicates that for the building of God's dwelling place, the Lord is one with our spirit, and our spirit is one with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). Our spirit is where the building of the church, the dwelling place of God, takes place. ",
  "5646":"Chapters 1 and 2 cover the revelation of the church, and this chapter covers the constituting of the church. After unveiling in chs. 1 and 2 God's blessings to the church and what the church is and how it is produced, the apostle began, from this chapter, to beseech the saints to walk according to his revelation in a way worthy of God's calling. In order that the church might be constituted and realized in a practical, experiential way, he presented himself as a steward (v. 2), as one who had received grace (v. 2) and revelation (vv. 3, 5) and had become a minister of the high gospel, announcing the riches of Christ as the gospel for the producing of the church. ",
  "5647":"The apostle Paul considered himself a prisoner of Christ. Apparently, he was confined in prison; actually, he was imprisoned in Christ. On the basis of such a status, the status in which he actually lived, he besought the saints. In releasing in chs. 1 and 2 the revelation of God's mystery concerning the church, Paul assumed his status as an apostle of Christ through the will of God. That status was the basis of the authority of his revelation concerning the church. In beseeching the saints to walk worthily of God's calling, he used his status as a prisoner of the Lord. His status as an apostle of Christ qualified him to release God's revelation, whereas his status as a prisoner of the Lord spoke forth his walk in the Lord, by which he could inspire and beseech the saints to walk in the Lord as he did. If we enjoy Christ as our prison, we too will walk in the Lord for the constituting of the church. ",
  "5648":"Verses 2-21 are a parenthesis, and 4:1 is a continuation of 3:1. In this parenthetical, beseeching word, the apostle described to the Gentile believers his ministry for them, a ministry that he received in the stewardship of grace through the revelation of the mystery of Christ. Also, he prayed in this parenthesis that the church would experience Christ to the fullest extent. ",
  "5649":"In Greek, the same word as economy in v. 9 and in 1:10. In relation to God, this word denotes God's economy, God's administration; in relation to the apostle, it denotes the stewardship (stewardshi is used also in 1 Cor. 9:17). The stewardship of the grace is for the dispensing of the grace of God to His chosen people for the producing and building up of the church. Out of this stewardship comes the ministry of the apostle, who is a steward in God's house, ministering Christ as God's grace to God's household. ",
  "5650":"Grace refers to the riches of Christ (v. 8), which God has given to us in Christ for us to gain and enjoy. Paul's ministry was to dispense the riches of Christ as grace to the believers for their enjoyment. ",
  "5651":"God's hidden purpose is the mystery, and the unveiling of this mystery is revelation. The apostle's ministry was to carry out this revelation for the producing of the church. ",
  "5652":"The mystery of God in Col. 2:2 is Christ; the mystery of Christ here is the church. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ also is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ. This mystery is God's economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God's chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God's embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression. ",
  "5653":"The mystery of Christ, the church, was hidden in other generations but has been revealed in the New Testament age. ",
  "5654":"Apostles in Greek means sent ones. The apostles are the ones sent by Christ, representing Him to carry out His commission in God's New Testament economy. The prophets are God's spokesmen, not primarily predicting the future but speaking for God and speaking forth God in the revelation of God's eternal economy. ",
  "5655":"The human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God's Spirit. Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is revealed to the apostles and prophets. We need the same kind of spirit to see such a revelation. ",
  "5656":"In God's New Testament economy the chosen, redeemed, and regenerated Gentiles and the believing Jews are fellow heirs of God, inheriting God. ",
  "5657":"The saved Gentiles and the saved Jews are fellow members of the one Body of Christ as His unique expression. ",
  "5658":"The Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are fellow partakers of God's promise given in the Old Testament, concerning all the blessings of God's New Testament economy. <br><br>   Being fellow heirs is related to the blessing of the household of God; being fellow members of the Body, to the blessing of the Body of Christ; and being fellow partakers of the promise, to the blessing of the promise of God, such as in Gen. 3:15; 12:3; 22:18; 28:14; and Isa. 9:6. Both the blessing of God's household and the blessing of Christ's Body are particular, whereas the blessing of God's promise is general, all-inclusive. ",
  "5659":"A minister is one who serves. A minister of the gospel serves the gospel to people. ",
  "5660":"The grace of God is God Himself, especially as life, partaken of and enjoyed by us; the gift of grace is the ability and function produced out of the enjoyment of the grace of God. Grace implies life, and the gift is the ability that comes out of life. ",
  "5661":"The power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10), which operated within the apostle and operates within all the believers (1:19; 3:20). By such an inward, operating power of life the gift of grace was given to the apostle, that is, produced in him. ",
  "5662":"This indicates that all the saints can receive the same grace as that given to the apostle Paul. As to the person of Paul, he was the least among the apostles (1 Cor. 15:9); but as to his ministry, he was not behind the super-apostles (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11). Yet, as to the grace he received, he was less than the least of all saints. This implies that all the saints can receive the grace that he received. This is similar to the receiving of the same lifeblood by all the members of our physical body, however small they may be. But the ability (gift) that comes out of the lifeblood differs among the members. All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life that Paul had, but their gifts are not the same as Paul's. ",
  "5663":"Lit., untraceable. ",
  "5664":"The apostle announced not doctrines but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness, what He has for us, and what He accomplished, attained, and obtained for us. These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable.",
  "5665":"See notes 10 in ch. 1 and 4 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "5666":"God's mystery is His hidden purpose, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the economy of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages, but now the New Testament believers, having been enlightened, are able to see it. ",
  "5667":"Lit., from. ",
  "5668":"The angelic rulers and authorities, both good and evil. The passage here refers particularly to the evil ones &#151; Satan and his angels. ",
  "5669":"Chapter 1 speaks of the power of God (1:19-20), ch. 2 of the grace of God (2:5-8), and this chapter of the wisdom of God. ",
  "5670":"As revealed in v. 8, the church is produced from the unsearchable riches of Christ. When God's chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, they are constituted with those riches to be the church, through which God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God's wise exhibition of all that Christ is. ",
  "5671":"Lit., the purpose of the ages. The eternal purpose is the eternal plan that God made in eternity past. ",
  "5672":"Or, carried out, fulfilled, accomplished. ",
  "5673":"Lit., the Christ, our Lord Jesus. For the Christ, see note 10 in ch. 1. ",
  "5674":"In Christ we have access, entry, not only that we may approach God but also that we may partake of His New Testament economy. Through faith in Christ we have such access &#151; with boldness and in confidence &#151; that we may enjoy God and His eternal plan (economy). ",
  "5675":"Or, the faith of Him. See note 22 in Rom. 3. ",
  "5676":"Not God but the Father. Father is used here in a broad sense, signifying not only the Father of the household of the faith (Gal. 6:10) but also the Father of every family in the heavens and on earth (v. 15). The Father is the source not only of us, the regenerated believers, but also of the God-created mankind (Luke 3:38), the God-created Israel (Isa. 63:16; 64:8), and the God-created angels (Job 1:6). The Jews' concept was that God was Father only to them. So the apostle, in keeping with his revelation, prayed to the Father of all the families in the heavens and on earth. In contrast, the Jews, in keeping with the Jewish concept, prayed only to the Father of Israel. ",
  "5677":"The Greek word means the lineage from a father, implying a family. ",
  "5678":"As God is the source of the angelic family in the heavens and of all the human families on earth, so it is of Him that every family is named, just as producers give names to their products and fathers give names to their children. ",
  "5679":"In vv. 16-19 the word that is used four times in the apostle's prayer: the apostle prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened; the result of such a strengthening is that Christ makes His home in our hearts; the result of Christ's making His home in our hearts is that we are full of strength to apprehend the dimensions of Christ &#151; the breadth, length, height, and depth &#151; and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ; and the result of this apprehending and this knowing is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. These steps make up a metabolic process by which the Body of Christ is constituted with the riches of Christ through our enjoyment of those riches. ",
  "5680":"Glory is the expression of God. All the families in the heavens and on earth express God to some extent. As they express God, there are the riches of His glory. The apostle prayed that the Gentile believers might experience the fullness of God according to the riches of His glory, that He might be expressed thereby. ",
  "5681":"The apostle's prayer in 1:15-23 was that the saints would receive revelation concerning the church. Here in vv. 14-21 his prayer is that the saints would experience Christ for the church. This requires us to be strengthened into our spirit. ",
  "5682":"The power that is referred to in 1:19-22 and that raised Christ from the dead, seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Christ's feet, and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Such power operates in us (v. 20), and with such power God strengthens us for the church. ",
  "5683":"The Father strengthens us from within through the indwelling Spirit, who has been with us and in us since our regeneration. ",
  "5684":"The inner man is our regenerated spirit, which has God's life as its life. In order that we may experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. This implies that we need to be strengthened into our spirit through the Holy Spirit. ",
  "5685":"Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul &#151; mind, emotion, and will &#151; plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. These parts are the inward parts of our being. Through regeneration Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). After this, we should allow Him to spread into every part of our heart. Since our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself. ",
  "5686":"Faith is the substantiation of things not seen (Heb. 11:1). Christ's indwelling is mysterious and abstract. We apprehend it not by our physical senses but by the sense of faith. ",
  "5687":"We are God's cultivated land and God's building (1 Cor. 3:9). As God's cultivated land, we need to be rooted for our growth, and as God's building, we need to be grounded for our building up. ",
  "5688":"To experience Christ we need faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith enables us to apprehend Christ, and love enables us to enjoy Him. Neither faith nor love are ours; they are His. His faith becomes our faith, by which we believe in Him, and His love becomes our love, by which we love Him. When we are rooted and grounded in His love, we grow and are built up in His life. ",
  "5689":"Or, grasp, lay hold of intensively. ",
  "5690":"To apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we need all the saints, not individually but corporately. ",
  "5691":"The breadth, length, height, and depth are the dimensions of Christ. In our experience of Christ, we first experience the breadth of what He is, and then the length. This is horizontal. When we advance in Christ, we experience the height and depth of His riches. This is vertical. Our experience of Christ must become three-dimensional, like a cube, and must not be one-dimensional, like a line. In our experience of Christ we must go back and forth and up and down, that eventually our experience of Him may be a solid \"cube.\" When our experience is like this, we cannot fall or be broken. ",
  "5692":"The love of Christ is Christ Himself. Just as Christ is immeasurable, so also is His love; hence, it is knowledge-surpassing. Yet, we can know it by experiencing it. ",
  "5693":"When Christ makes His home in our hearts, and when we are full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church, the corporate expression of God for the fulfillment of His intention. <br><br>   The fullness of God implies that the riches of all that God is have become His expression. When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16). All the fullness of God dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling, Christ imparts the fullness of God into our being that we may be filled even unto the fullness of God to be the practical manifestation of the church, in which God may be glorified in His expression (v. 21). ",
  "5694":"In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches. This is the reason that in v. 8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and that in 1:23 and then in 4:13 he speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is and has and all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. The fullness of Christ is the result and issue of our enjoyment of these riches. When the riches of Christ are assimilated into our being metabolically, they constitute us to be the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. First, in 1:23 this expression is the fullness of Christ, and then in this verse it is the fullness of God, for the fullness of Christ, the embodiment of God, is the very fullness of the Triune God. ",
  "5695":"The Father (v. 14) answers and fulfills the apostle's prayer through the Spirit (v. 16) that Christ, the Son (v. 17), may make His home in our hearts. Thus we are filled unto the fullness of God &#151; the Triune God. This is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into our entire being. ",
  "5696":"Verses 16-19 are the apostle's prayer. The word but makes vv. 20-21 a doxology. In his prayer the apostle prayed that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory. This implies that the glory of God can be wrought into the saints. In the doxology he said, \"To Him be the glory\" (v. 21), implying that the glory of God, which has been wrought into the saints, returns to God. First, the glory of God is wrought into us; then it returns to God for His glorification. Isaac's wealth was first given to Rebekah for her beautification; then all the wealth came back to Isaac, with Rebekah, for his glorification (Gen. 24:47, 53, 61-67). The apostle prayed that God would strengthen the saints according to His glory, \"but\" eventually God's glory, after being wrought into them, returns to Him along with the strengthened saints. This is the way in which God is glorified in the church. ",
  "5697":"Strictly, ask or think here is in regard to the spiritual things related to the church, not in regard to material things. Concerning these spiritual things, we need to think as well as to ask. We might think more than we ask. God fulfills not only what we ask for the church but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that operates in us. ",
  "5698":"The inward power, referred to in 1:19-20, is God's resurrection power, not His creating power. God's creating power produces the material things in our environment (Rom. 8:28), whereas God's resurrection power accomplishes within our inward being the spiritual things for the church. ",
  "5699":"See note 6 in ch. 1. We are being strengthened into our inner man according to the riches of God's glory (v. 16). This glory comes to us with God and, after being worked into us, will return to God with us. By means of this two-way traffic the church, as the firstfruits in the universe (James 1:18), takes the lead to give glory to God. All the other families both in heaven and on earth will follow the church to glorify Him. ",
  "5700":"God's glory is wrought into the church, and He is expressed in the church. Hence, to God is the glory in the church; that is, God is glorified in the church. ",
  "5701":"God is glorified not only in the church but also in Christ. The word and is used here to stress this point emphatically. ",
  "5702":"In the church the sphere of God's glorification is narrow, being limited to the household of the faith. But in Christ the sphere is much broader because Christ is the Head of all the families in the heavens and on earth (1:22; 3:15). Hence, God's glorification in Christ is in the realm of all the families created by God, not only on earth but also in the heavens. This is in accord with unto all the generations forever and ever, which means for eternity. ",
  "5703":"All the generations forever and ever constitute eternity. God's glorification in the church is mainly in this age, whereas God's glorification in Christ is for eternity. ",
  "5704":"This verse in part repeats 3:1, where the apostle's exhortation in chs. 4--6 begins. This indicates that 3:2-21 is parenthetical. See note 1 in ch. 3. ",
  "5705":"See note 1 in ch. 3. In 3:1 Paul speaks of himself as \"the prisoner of Christ Jesus,\" but here he says that he is \"the prisoner in the Lord.\" To be a prisoner in the Lord is deeper than to be a prisoner of the Lord. As such a prisoner, Paul is a pattern for those who would walk worthily of God's calling.",
  "5706":"This book is divided into two main sections. The first, composed of chs. 1--3, reveals the blessings and the position the church has obtained in Christ in the heavenlies. The second, comprising chs. 4--6, charges us concerning the living and responsibility the church should have in the Spirit on the earth. The basic charge is that we should walk worthily of God's calling, which is the totality of the blessings bestowed on the church, as revealed in 1:3-14. In the church, under the Triune God's abundant blessing, the saints should walk worthily of the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging. Hence, in chs. 4--6 we see, on the one hand, the living that the church should have, and, on the other hand, the responsibility that the church should bear. ",
  "5707":"To be lowly is to remain in a low estate, and to be meek is to not fight for oneself. We should exercise these two virtues in dealing with ourselves. To be long-suffering is to endure mistreatment. We should exercise this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear (not just tolerate) one another; that is, we do not forsake the troublesome ones but bear them in love. This is the expression of life. <br><br>   These virtues are not found in our natural humanity but are in the humanity of Jesus. The fact that the virtues are mentioned here, before the oneness of the Spirit in v. 3, indicates that we must have these virtues in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This implies that in the uniting Spirit there is the transformed humanity, the humanity transformed by the resurrection life of Christ. ",
  "5708":"Or, safeguard, preserve by guarding. The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. To keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the life-giving Spirit. If we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness. If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit. ",
  "5709":"To walk worthily of God's calling, to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ. Strictly, oneness differs from unity. Unity is the state in which many people are united together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers, which makes them all one. This oneness is a person, Christ Himself, who is the Spirit dwelling within us. It is similar to the electricity flowing within many lamps, making them all one in the shining. In themselves, the lamps are separate, but in the electricity they are one. ",
  "5710":"Christ abolished on the cross all the differences that were due to ordinances. In so doing He made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together and should thus become the uniting bond. The uniting bond of peace is the issue of the working of the cross. When we remain on the cross, we have peace with others. This peace becomes the uniting bond in which we keep the oneness of the Spirit. ",
  "5711":"In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness, the apostle pointed out seven things that form the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God. These seven \"ones\" are of three groups. The first three form the first group, that of the Spirit with the Body as His expression. This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three form the second group, that of the Lord with faith and baptism that we may be joined to Him. The last of the seven forms the third group, the one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body &#151; all the three of the Triune God &#151; are related to the Body. The Third of the Trinity is the first mentioned in vv. 4-6 because the main concern here is the Body, of which the Spirit is the essence and the life and life supply. The course is then traced back to the Son and to the Father. ",
  "5712":"The hope of glory (Col. 1:27), which is the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21) and the manifestation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19, 23-25). ",
  "5713":"This verse does not say \"one Son,\" but \"one Lord.\" In the Gospel of John it is the Son into whom we believe (John 3:16), but in the Acts it is the Lord into whom we believe (Acts 16:31). In the Epistles of John, the Son is for the imparting of life (1 John 5:12), whereas in the Acts, the Lord, after His ascension, is for the exercising of authority (Acts 2:36), a matter which concerns His headship. Hence, our believing in Him is related to both life and authority, for He is both our life and our Head. As the Head of the Body (1:22), He is the Lord. Christians are divided because they neglect the Head; that is, they neglect the Lord's headship and authority. ",
  "5714":"Through faith we believe into the Lord (John 3:36), and through baptism we are baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3) and terminated in Adam (Rom. 6:4). Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). Immediately after believing in Christ, we should be baptized to complete the transfer. ",
  "5715":"God is the Originator of all things, and the Father is the source of life for the Body of Christ. ",
  "5716":"Referring to all believers. ",
  "5717":"The Trinity is implied even here. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. The Triune God eventually enters into us all by reaching us as the Spirit. The oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted of the Trinity of the Godhead &#151; the Father as the source and origin being the Originator, the Son as the Lord and Head being the Accomplisher, and the Spirit as the life-giving Spirit being the Executor. The Triune God Himself, when realized and experienced by us in our daily life, is the fundamental basis and very foundation of our oneness. ",
  "5718":"Concerning the Body of Christ, all the basic elements are one, but the gifts (the functions) are many and varied. ",
  "5719":"Here grace was given according to the gift; in Rom. 12:6 the gifts differ according to grace. Grace actually is the divine life that produces and supplies the gifts. In Rom. 12 it is the grace that produces the gift. Hence, the gift is according to grace. Here the grace is according to the gift, according to the measure of the gift. This is similar to our blood supplying the members of our body according to their size. ",
  "5720":"The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of His Body. ",
  "5721":"Height in the quotation from Psa. 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (Psa. 68:15-16), which symbolizes the third heaven, where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30). Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had won the victory. Verse 1 of Psa. 68 is taken from Num. 10:35. This indicates that the background of Psa. 68 is God's move in the tabernacle with the ark as its center. Wherever the ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won. Eventually, this ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion. This portrays how Christ won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens. ",
  "5722":"Those refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He conquered and overcame Satan, who had captured them by sin and death. <br><br>   The Amplified New Testament renders \"He led captive those taken captive\" as \"He led a train of vanquished foes.\" Vanquished foes may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death. In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ's victory. ",
  "5723":"Gifts here does not refer to the abilities or capacities for various services but to the gifted persons in v. 11 &#151; apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After conquering Satan and death and rescuing the sinners from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts by means of His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up. ",
  "5724":"Referring to Hades, which is under the earth. Christ went there after His death (Acts 2:27). ",
  "5725":"First, in His incarnation Christ descended from heaven to earth. Then, in His death He descended farther, from earth to Hades. Eventually, in His resurrection He ascended from Hades to earth, and in His ascension, from earth to heaven. Through such a journey He cut the way that He might fill all things. ",
  "5726":"Each one in v. 7 includes every member of the Body of Christ, each of whom has received a general gift; whereas the four kinds of gifted persons mentioned here are those who have been endued with a special gift. ",
  "5727":"According to the grammatical construction, shepherds and teachers refers to a single class of gifted persons. A shepherd should know how to teach, and a teacher should be able to shepherd. ",
  "5728":"Or, equipping, supplying the functions. ",
  "5729":"Unto here means resulting in, for the purpose of, or with a view to. ",
  "5730":"The many gifted persons in the preceding verse have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. This is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy (2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12). ",
  "5731":"According to the grammatical construction, the building up of the Body of Christ is the work of the ministry. Whatever the gifted persons in v. 11 do as the work of the ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ. However, this building up is not accomplished directly by the gifted ones but by the saints who have been perfected by the gifted ones. ",
  "5732":"Or, attain to. This indicates that a process is required for us to attain to or arrive at the practical oneness. ",
  "5733":"In v. 3 the oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the divine life in reality; in this verse the oneness is the oneness of our living in practicality. We already have the oneness of the divine life in reality. We need only to keep it. But we need to go on until we arrive at the oneness of our living in practicality. This aspect of oneness is of two things: the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God. As revealed in Jude 3, 2 Tim. 4:7, and 1 Tim. 6:21, the faith does not refer to the act of our believing but to the things in which we believe, such as the divine person of Christ and His redemptive work accomplished for our salvation. The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. The more we grow in life, the more we will cleave to the faith and to the apprehension of Christ, and the more we will drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts that cause divisions. Then we will arrive at, or attain to, the practical oneness; that is, we will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. ",
  "5734":"The Son of God refers to the Lord's person as life to us, whereas Christ refers to His commission to minister life to us that we, the members of His Body, may have gifts for functioning. See note 16 in Matt. 16. ",
  "5735":"A full-grown man is a mature man. Maturity in life is needed for the practical oneness. ",
  "5736":"The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (1:23), which has a stature with a measure. To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is necessary for the practical oneness. Hence, from the oneness in reality we need to proceed to the oneness in practicality until we arrive at the three things mentioned in this verse &#151; the oneness, a full-grown man, and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. ",
  "5737":"Lit., infants. The same Greek word as for child in Gal. 4:1, referring to those believers who are young in Christ, lacking maturity in life (1 Cor. 3:1). ",
  "5738":"The waves stirred up by the winds of different teachings (1 Tim. 1:3-4), doctrines, concepts, and opinions are sent by Satan to entice the believers in order to carry them away from Christ and the church. It is difficult for the infants in Christ to discern these. The only way to escape from the waves that are stirred up by the winds is to grow in life, and the safe way to grow in life is to stay in the proper church life with Christ and the church as the safeguard. ",
  "5739":"Any teaching, even a scriptural one, that distracts believers from Christ and the church is a wind that carries believers away from God's central purpose. ",
  "5740":"The Greek word for sleight refers to the cheating of dice players. The word for craftiness denotes the trickery employed by gamblers. The teachings that become winds, carrying believers away from the central lane of Christ and the church, are deceptions instigated by Satan in his subtlety, with the sleight of men, in order to frustrate God's eternal purpose, which is to build up the Body of Christ. ",
  "5741":"The dividing teachings are organized and systematized by Satan to cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life. The sleight is of men, but the system of error is of Satan and is related to the deceitful teachings that are designed by the evil one to distract the saints from Christ and the church life. ",
  "5742":"Or, truthing it. This is in contrast to the sleight and the error in v. 14. To be carried away by the winds of teaching in the sleight of men unto a system of error is to not hold to truth. Truth here means things that are true. According to the context, it must refer to Christ and His Body: both are true things. We should hold in love to these true things that we may grow up into Christ. ",
  "5743":"This is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body. It is in such a love that we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His Body, and are kept from being influenced by the winds of teaching and from bringing in elements that are foreign to the Body. ",
  "5744":"To be no longer little children (v. 14), we need to grow up into Christ. This is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man (v. 13). ",
  "5745":"Head here indicates that our growth in life by the increase of Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head. ",
  "5746":"To grow in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but to operate in the Body of Christ is to operate out from Him. First, we grow up into the Head; then we have something that is out from the Head for the building up of the Body. ",
  "5747":"Joined implies the thought of joining by fitting; knit implies the thought of interweaving. ",
  "5748":"Every joint of the rich supply refers to the specially gifted persons, such as those mentioned in v. 11. ",
  "5749":"In Greek the article here is emphatic. Hence, the rich supply must be the particular supply, the supply of Christ. ",
  "5750":"Most of the ancient MSS read, according to the operation. ",
  "5751":"Or, functioning. The same Greek word as in 3:7 and Col. 1:29, and of the same origin as operations in 1 Cor. 12:6. ",
  "5752":"Each one part refers to each member of the Body. Through the growth in life and the development of gifts, each member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body. ",
  "5753":"The Body of Christ causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and the operating parts. ",
  "5754":"The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body by the Body itself. ",
  "5755":"See note 15. ",
  "5756":"The apostle's word here was not only his exhortation but also his testimony. His exhortation was his living. ",
  "5757":"Verses 1-16 deal with the living and the function of the Body of Christ. Now, in vv. 17-32 our daily life is touched. Verses 17-24 give us the principles of our daily walk, and vv. 25-32 give us the details. ",
  "5758":"The Gentiles are the fallen people, who become vain in their reasonings (Rom. 1:21). They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, being controlled and directed by their vain thoughts. Whatever they do according to their fallen mind is vanity, void of reality. ",
  "5759":"When the mind of fallen people is filled with vanity, their understanding is darkened regarding the things of God. Thus, they are alienated, separated, from the life of God. ",
  "5760":"This is the uncreated, eternal life of God, which man did not have at the time of creation. After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) that he might receive the uncreated divine life. But man fell into the vanity of his mind and became darkened in his understanding. Now, in such a fallen condition man is unable to touch the life of God until he repents (has his mind turned to God) and believes in the Lord Jesus to receive God's eternal life (Acts 11:18; John 3:16). ",
  "5761":"Ignorance denotes not only a lack of knowledge but also an unwillingness to know. Because of the hardness of his heart, fallen man does not approve of knowing the things of God (Rom. 1:28). Therefore, his understanding is darkened so that he does not know God. ",
  "5762":"The hardness of fallen man's heart is the source of the darkness in his understanding and the vanity of his mind. ",
  "5763":"Feeling here refers mainly to the consciousness of one's conscience. Hence, being past feeling means not caring for one's conscience. After man fell, God ordained that man should be under the ruling of his conscience. But instead of regarding his conscience, fallen man gave himself over to lasciviousness and greedy lust. ",
  "5764":"Christ is not only life to us but also an example (John 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:21). In His life on earth He set up a pattern, as revealed in the Gospels. Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us to be our life. We learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) according to His example, not by our natural life but by Him as our life in resurrection. To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). ",
  "5765":"The reality is in Jesus refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity. But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is what is meant by the reality is in Jesus. We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus. ",
  "5766":"Verses 22 and 24 show us what we have been taught: that we put off the old man and put on the new man. Our putting off of the old man and putting on of the new man is a manifestation of our having learned Christ. ",
  "5767":"In baptism we put off the old man. Our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and was buried in baptism (Rom. 6:4a). ",
  "5768":"The former manner of life is a walk in the vanity of the mind (v. 17). ",
  "5769":"The old man is of Adam, who was created by God but became fallen through sin. ",
  "5770":"The article here is emphatic, and the deceit is personified. Hence, the deceit refers to the deceiver, Satan, from whom come the lusts of the corrupted old man. ",
  "5771":"Our being renewed is for our transformation into the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). ",
  "5772":"This is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation. ",
  "5773":"It was in baptism that we put on the new man (Rom. 6:4b). ",
  "5774":"The new man is of Christ. It is His Body, created in Him on the cross (2:15-16). It is not individual but corporate (Col. 3:10-11). In this corporate new man Christ is all and in all &#151; He is all the people and in all the people. See note 11 in Col. 3. <br><br>   This book reveals first that the church is the Body of Christ (1:22-23), the kingdom of God, the household of God (2:19), and the temple, the dwelling place of God (2:21-22). Here it reveals in addition that the church is the new man. This is the highest aspect of the church. The church is an assembly of the called-out ones. This is the initial aspect of the church. From here, the apostle went on to mention the fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and the members of the household of God. These are higher than the initial aspect, but not as high as the church as the Body of Christ. Yet the new man is higher still than the Body of Christ. Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, or even a Body for Christ. It is in its ultimate, uttermost aspect a new man to accomplish God's eternal purpose. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. This new corporate person should live a life like that which Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized as the reality by man. Hence, the new man is the focus of the apostle's exhortation in this section (vv. 17-32). ",
  "5775":"The old man was created outwardly according to the image of God but without God's life and nature (Gen. 1:26-27), whereas the new man was created inwardly according to God Himself and with God's life and nature (Col. 3:10). ",
  "5776":"Righteousness is to be right with God and with man according to God's righteous way, while holiness is godliness and devoutness before God (see note 75 in Luke 1). Righteousness is mainly toward men, and holiness is mainly toward God. ",
  "5777":"The article here is emphatic. As the deceit in v. 22, related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so the reality here, related to the new man, is the personification of God. The deceit is the devil, and the reality is God. This reality was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as mentioned in v. 21. In the life of Jesus, righteousness and holiness of the reality were continuously manifested. It was in the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created. ",
  "5778":"Verses 25-32 give a description of our practical daily living in learning Christ. ",
  "5779":"The lie refers to anything that is false in nature. Because we put off the old man, we also put off everything that is false in nature. Hence, we speak truth, that is, we speak the things that are true. ",
  "5780":"To be angry is not a sin, but with it there is the possibility of committing sin. We should not continue in anger but should relinquish it before the sun sets. ",
  "5781":"Or, vexation. ",
  "5782":"According to the context, to continue in anger is to give place to the devil. In nothing should we give any place to him. ",
  "5783":"Even in a book of such high revelation, the apostle still touched certain low, practical things, such as stealing and anger. ",
  "5784":"Stealing is due mainly to slothfulness and greed. Hence, the apostle charged him who steals to labor instead of being slothful, and to share with others what he gains instead of being greedy. ",
  "5785":"Or, that which is good. See Titus 3:8, 14. ",
  "5786":"Lit., rotten; signifying what is noxious, offensive, or worthless. ",
  "5787":"Our conversation should not corrupt others but should build them up. ",
  "5788":"Grace is Christ as our enjoyment and supply. Our word should convey such grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers Christ as grace to the hearer. <br><br>   The apostle's exhortation in vv. 17-32 took grace and reality (vv. 21, 24, 29) as its basic elements. The apostle wanted us to live, as Jesus did, a life full of grace and reality (John 1:14, 17). Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment, and reality is God revealed to us as our reality. When we live and speak reality (vv. 21, 24), we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment (v. 29). ",
  "5789":"To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him. The Holy Spirit abides in us forever (John 14:16-17), never leaving us. Hence, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (Rom. 8:4), that is, when we do not live according to the principle of reality with grace in the details of our daily walk. ",
  "5790":"The apostle's exhortation in vv. 17-32 not only takes grace and reality as the basic elements but also takes the life of God (v. 18) and the Spirit of God as the basic factors on the positive side, and the devil (v. 27) as a factor on the negative side. It is by the life of God in the Spirit of God, and by not giving place to the devil, that we can live a life full of grace and reality, as the Lord Jesus did. ",
  "5791":"I.e., in the Holy Spirit as the element. We were sealed in the element of the Holy Spirit. This shows that God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit as the sealing element. ",
  "5792":"See note 13 in ch. 1. ",
  "5793":"From the time that we are saved, the Holy Spirit as the seal in us seals us continually with the element of God that we may be transformed in nature until our body is completely transfigured and redeemed. Hence, this verse says that we were sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the day of the redemption of our body. ",
  "5794":"See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "5795":"The Greek word has the same origin as moved with compassion in Matt. 9:36 and inward parts in Phil. 1:8. Only by enjoying Christ as grace and reality can we be tenderhearted and thus be able to forgive one another. ",
  "5796":"Or, showing grace to. ",
  "5797":"In his exhortation in this section (vv. 17-32), the apostle presented God as the pattern of our daily life. In the Spirit and by His life, we can forgive as God forgives. ",
  "5798":"Or, showed grace to. ",
  "5799":"What a glorious fact that since we are God's beloved children, we can be imitators of God! As the children of God, we have His life and nature. We imitate Him not by our natural life but by His divine life. It is by our Father's divine life that we, His children, can be perfect, as He is (Matt. 5:48). ",
  "5800":"As grace and reality (truth) are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light (vv. 8-9, 13) are the basic elements in the apostle's exhortation in 5:1-33. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth. God is love and God is light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, the apostle first took grace and truth as the basic elements for his exhortation, and then love and light. This implies that he wanted our daily walk to grow deeper, to progress from the outward elements to the inward. <br><br>   Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God. The inward love of God is sensible, and the outward light of God is visible. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God. These should be the inner source of our walk. They are deeper than grace and truth. ",
  "5801":"In 4:32 the apostle presented God as the pattern of our daily walk. Here he set forth Christ as the example of our living. In 4:32 God in Christ is our pattern, since in that section God's grace and reality (truth) expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements. But here Christ Himself is our example, since in this section love expressed by Christ to us (vv. 2, 25) and light shined by Christ upon us (v. 14) are taken as the basic elements. ",
  "5802":"Some ancient authorities read, you. ",
  "5803":"An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin. Christ gave Himself up for us as both an offering, that we might have fellowship with God, and a sacrifice, that He might redeem us from sin. ",
  "5804":"In loving us, Christ gave Himself up for us. This was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God. In following His example, our walk in love should be not only something for others but also a sweet-smelling savor to God. ",
  "5805":"Nothing is more damaging to mankind than fornication. It is especially damaging to God's purpose and intention in creating man and to the believers' church life in the Body of Christ. This is based on 1 Cor. 5. ",
  "5806":"Persons who are separated unto God and saturated with God and who live a life according to God's holy nature. ",
  "5807":"To give thanks to God is to speak God as truth, whereas to talk foolishly or to jest filthily is to speak Satan as falsehood. ",
  "5808":"The Greek word denotes subjective knowledge. ",
  "5809":"The Greek word denotes objective knowledge. ",
  "5810":"The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28) and also the kingdom of God (Matt. 13:41, 43, and notes). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:5), and they are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). Not all believers, only the overcoming ones, will participate in the millennium. In the coming age the unclean, defeated ones will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God, the millennium. See notes 20 in Matt. 5 and 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "5811":"We were once not only dark but darkness itself. Now we are not only the children of light but light itself (Matt. 5:14). As light is God, so darkness is Satan. We were darkness because we were one with Satan. Now we are light because we are one with God in the Lord. ",
  "5812":"Verse 2 tells us to walk in love, and this verse tells us to walk as children of light. ",
  "5813":"As God is light, so we, the children of God, are the children of light. ",
  "5814":"Goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; righteousness is the way or the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced; and truth is the reality, the real expression (God Himself), of the fruit of the light. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk. <br><br>   The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God. Goodness denotes God the Father, for the only one who is good is God (Matt. 19:17). Righteousness denotes God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God's purpose according to God's righteous procedure (Rom. 5:17-18, 21). Truth denotes God the Spirit, for He is the Spirit of reality (John 14:17). Truth also denotes the expression of the fruit in the light. ",
  "5815":"The unfruitful works of darkness are vanity, whereas the fruit of the light is truth, reality (v. 9). ",
  "5816":"Or, expose, uncover. ",
  "5817":"Or, exposed, uncovered. ",
  "5818":"The sleeping one who needs the reproving mentioned in vv. 11 and 13 is also a dead one. He needs to awake from sleep and arise from the dead. ",
  "5819":"When we reprove or expose anyone who is sleeping and dead in darkness, Christ will shine on him. Our reproving or exposing in light is Christ's shining. ",
  "5820":"To live by being filled in spirit (vv. 15-21) is the fifth aspect of a walk that is worthy of God's calling. The first four aspects of such a worthy walk are keeping the oneness, growing up into the Head, learning Christ, and living in love and light. The issue of having these four aspects of a worthy walk is that we are spontaneously filled in our spirit. Out of this inward filling will come submission, love, obedience, care, and all the other virtues of a proper Christian life, church life, family life, and community life. What a life we have when we demonstrate the five aspects of a walk that is worthy of God's calling! ",
  "5821":"I.e., seizing every favorable opportunity. This is to be wise in our walk (v. 15). ",
  "5822":"In this evil age (Gal 1:4) every day is an evil day full of pernicious things that cause our time to be used ineffectively, to be reduced, and to be taken away. Therefore, we must walk wisely that we may redeem the time, seizing every available opportunity. ",
  "5823":"To understand the will of the Lord is the best way to redeem our time (v. 16). Most of our time is wasted because we do not know the will of the Lord. ",
  "5824":"To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit (our regenerated spirit, not God's Spirit) is to be filled with Christ (1:23) unto the fullness of God (3:19). To be drunk with wine in our physical body causes us to become dissolute, but to be filled in our spirit with Christ, with the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Christ in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God (vv. 19-20) and also causes us to subject ourselves to one another (v. 21). ",
  "5825":"Verses 19-21 modify be filled in spirit in v. 18. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming but also for speaking to one another. Such speaking, singing, psalming, giving of thanks to God (v. 20), and subjecting of ourselves to one another (v. 21) are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit. ",
  "5826":"Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter poems, and spiritual songs are poems that are shorter still. All are needed in order for us to be filled with the Lord and to overflow with Him in our Christian life. ",
  "5827":"We should give thanks to God the Father not only in good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things. Even in bad times we should give thanks to God our Father for the bad things. ",
  "5828":"The reality of the name of the Lord is His person. To be in the Lord's name is to be in His person, in Himself. This implies that we should be one with the Lord in giving thanks to God. ",
  "5829":"Being subject to one another also is a way to be filled in spirit with the Lord (v. 18) and is the overflow of being filled. This is to live in the way of being filled in spirit with all the riches of Christ unto the fullness of God. ",
  "5830":"Our subjection should be to one another &#151; the younger ones to the older ones, and also the older ones to the younger ones (1 Pet. 5:5). ",
  "5831":"According to the context of the succeeding verses, to be in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Him as the Head. This is related to His headship (v. 23) and involves our being subject to one another. See note 33. ",
  "5832":"The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit. Only by being filled in our spirit can we have a proper married life, a figure of the relationship between Christ and the church. ",
  "5833":"This is one kind of subjection implied in v. 21. In his exhortation concerning married life, the apostle dealt first with wives, since wives, like Eve in Gen. 3, deviate from the right way more easily than husbands. First Peter 3:7 says that the wife is the weaker vessel. In his exhortations concerning wives and husbands, children and parents, and slaves and masters, Paul took care of first the weaker side and then the stronger side. ",
  "5834":"Most wives appreciate and respect others' husbands; hence, the apostle exhorted wives to be subject to their own husbands as to the Lord, regardless of what kind of husbands they have. In the same principle, when Paul addressed husbands, he exhorted them to love their own wives (vv. 28, 33). If we desire to live according to reality, by grace, and in love and light, we must not compare our wife or husband with others'. ",
  "5835":"The husband as the head of the wife typifies Christ as the Head of the church. ",
  "5836":"Christ is not only the Head of the church but also the Savior of the Body. His being the Head is a matter of authority, whereas His being the Savior is a matter of love. We must be subject to Him as our Head, and we must love Him as our Savior. ",
  "5837":"The thought here is this: although husbands are not the savior of their wives in the way that Christ is the Savior of the church, wives still need to be subject to their husbands as the church is to Christ. ",
  "5838":"According to the divine ordination, the subjection of wives to their husbands should be absolute, without any choice. This does not mean that they should obey their husbands in everything. Obeying is different from being subject. With obedience, the emphasis is on compliance, whereas with subjection, the emphasis is on subordination. In sinful things, things against God and the Lord, wives should not obey their husbands. However, they should still be in subjection to them. In a similar situation, Daniel's three friends disobeyed the Babylonian king's order to worship the idol, yet still subjected themselves to the king's authority (Dan. 3:13-23). ",
  "5839":"The opposite of being subject is to rule; however, the apostle did not exhort husbands to rule over their wives but to love them. In married life, the wife's obligation is to be subject and the husband's is to love. The wife's subjection plus the husband's love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church. Love is the very element, the inner substance, of God (1 John 4:8, 16). The goal of this book is to bring us into God's inner substance that we may enjoy God as love and enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love, and thereby love others as Christ did. ",
  "5840":"A husband's love for his wife must be like Christ's love for the church; he must be willing to pay a price, even to die for his wife. ",
  "5841":"Christ's purpose in giving Himself up for the church is to sanctify her, not only separating her to Himself from everything common but also saturating her with His element that she may be His counterpart. He accomplishes this by cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word. ",
  "5842":"Lit., laver. In Greek the definite article is used before this word, causing it to refer to the laver, the laver that was known to all the Jews. In the Old Testament the priests used the laver to wash away their earthly defilement (Exo. 30:18-21). Now the laver, the washing of the water, washes us from defilement. ",
  "5843":"According to the divine concept, water here refers to the flowing life of God, which is typified by flowing water (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17). The washing of the water here is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ. The redeeming blood washes away our sins (1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14), whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as the \"spot or wrinkle or any such things\" mentioned in v. 27. In separating and sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood (Heb. 13:12) and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. We are now in such a washing process, that the church may be holy and without blemish (v. 27). ",
  "5844":"The Greek word denotes an instant word. The indwelling Christ as the life-giving Spirit is always speaking an instant, present, living word to metabolically cleanse away the old and replace it with the new, causing an inward transformation. The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word of Christ. This indicates that in the word of Christ there is the water of life. This is typified by the laver situated between the altar and the tabernacle (Exo. 38:8; 40:7). ",
  "5845":"In the past, Christ as the Redeemer gave Himself up for the church (v. 25) for redemption and the impartation of life (John 19:34); in the present, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building up; and in the future, He as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction. Therefore, Christ's loving the church is to separate and sanctify her, and His separating and sanctifying the church are to present her to Himself. ",
  "5846":"In this section of exhortation the apostle presented another aspect of the church, that of the bride. This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22), that it has the same life and nature as Christ, and that it becomes one with Him as His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam (Gen. 2:24). The church as the new man is a matter of grace and reality, whereas the church as the bride of Christ is a matter of love and light. The apostle's exhortation in ch. 4 is focused on the new man, which has grace and reality as its basic elements, whereas his exhortation in this chapter is focused on the bride of Christ, which has love and light as its basic substances. In grace and reality we should walk as the new man, and in love and light we should live as the bride of Christ. ",
  "5847":"Glory is God expressed. Hence, to be glorious is to be God-expressing. Eventually, the church presented to Christ will be a God-expressing church. ",
  "5848":"The spot here signifies something of the natural life, and wrinkles are related to oldness. Only the water of life can metabolically wash away such defects by the transformation of life. ",
  "5849":"To be holy is to be saturated with Christ and transformed by Christ, and to be without blemish is to be spotless and without wrinkle, having nothing of the natural life of our old man. ",
  "5850":"To nourish is to feed us with the living word of the Lord. To cherish is to nurture us with tender love and foster us with tender care, outwardly softening us through tender warmth that we may have soothing, comfortable rest inwardly. This is the way Christ cares for the church, His Body. ",
  "5851":"This is God's ordination according to His economy (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:5). ",
  "5852":"Lit., into one flesh. ",
  "5853":"Christ and the church as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), typified by a husband and wife as one flesh, are the great mystery. ",
  "5854":"Lit., his own wife as himself. ",
  "5855":"Because a wife should respect her husband as the head, the one who typifies Christ as the Head of the church, she should fear her husband in the fear of Christ (v. 21). ",
  "5856":"In exhorting the children and the parents, the apostle dealt with the children first, since trouble comes mostly from the children. <br><br>   Verses 1-9, which deal with the relationship between children and fathers and between slaves and masters, are inserted between the section on the church as the bride (5:22-33) and the section on the church as the warrior (vv. 10-20). If we neglect the points dealt with in vv. 1-9, we cannot be a proper bride or a proper warrior. In the exhortations in these verses, Paul made one key point, which is a very important lesson for us to learn: for the sake of the church life, we need to have a proper human living in this present age. ",
  "5857":"In the Lord indicates that children need to obey their parents (1) by being one with the Lord, (2) not by themselves but by the Lord, and (3) not according to their natural concept but according to the Lord's word. ",
  "5858":"Or, just, reasonable. For children to obey their parents is not only right but also just. ",
  "5859":"Honoring is different from obeying. Obeying is an action, whereas honoring is an attitude. It is possible for children to obey their parents without honoring them. In order to honor their parents, children need an honoring attitude, an honoring spirit. All children need to learn to obey their parents and, at the same time, honor them. ",
  "5860":"This is not only the first commandment with a promise but also the first commandment concerning man's relationship with man (Exo. 20:12). ",
  "5861":"To have it well with ourselves is to be prosperous in material blessings, and to live long is to have longevity. Prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their parents. If we wish to prolong our days and enjoy blessings, we must learn to obey and honor our parents. The commandment to honor our parents is the first commandment with a promise. ",
  "5862":"Provoking children to anger damages them by stirring up their flesh. Not to provoke his children to anger requires that a father deal with his anger by leaving it on the cross. In this way he is able to render suitable discipline to his children. ",
  "5863":"Admonition includes instruction. Parents should instruct their children with the Word of God (Deut. 6:6-7), teaching them to know the Bible. However, how the children develop depends on God's mercy. ",
  "5864":"Concerning the relationship between slaves and masters, the apostle exhorted the slaves first, because the source of trouble was mostly with them. ",
  "5865":"In the apostle's time slaves were purchased by their masters, and the masters had the right over their lives. Some slaves and masters became brothers in the church. As brothers in the church, they were equal and without distinction (see Col. 3:11), but at home those who were slaves still were obligated to obey the brothers who were their masters according to flesh. ",
  "5866":"Fear is the inward motive for service, and trembling the outward attitude. ",
  "5867":"To be single is to be pure in motive, without a mixed purpose. ",
  "5868":"The relationship between slaves and masters also is a type of our relationship with Christ, who is our Master. We should be like slaves, obeying Him in singleness of heart. ",
  "5869":"If a brother who is a slave stands in his position and obeys his master, he is in the eyes of the Lord a slave of Christ, doing the will of God, and he serves as serving the Lord and not men (v. 7). <br><br>   From the soul here equals from the heart. This means to serve not only with the physical body but also with the heart. ",
  "5870":"See note 6. ",
  "5871":"Whatever good thing we do, we will receive back the same from the Lord, and it will become a reward to us. ",
  "5872":"The masters, who had the right over the lives of their purchased slaves, needed to give up their threatening, because the Lord in the heavens was the real Master of both them and the slaves. ",
  "5873":"The passage from 1:1--6:9 completes the revelation on the positive side concerning the church's fulfilling of God's eternal purpose; yet on the negative side, concerning the church's dealing with God's enemy, there is more to be covered. ",
  "5874":"This implies that we need to exercise our will strongly. ",
  "5875":"This word in Greek has the same root as the word for power in 1:19. To deal with God's enemy, to fight against the evil forces of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air. ",
  "5876":"In the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves. Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated. ",
  "5877":"On the positive side, in the first five chapters the church is portrayed in many ways for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose. On the negative side, the church is seen here as a warrior for the defeating of God's enemy, the devil. To defeat God's enemy, we need to put on the whole armor of God. \"Put on\" is an imperative, a command. God has provided the armor for us, but He does not put it on for us. Rather, we ourselves must put it on, exercising our will to cooperate with Him. ",
  "5878":"To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God. Our weapons do not avail, but God's armor, even the whole armor of God, does avail. <br><br>   The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ, not for any individual member of the Body. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior, not any individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God. We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not as individuals. ",
  "5879":"In ch. 2 we sit with Christ in the heavenlies (2:6), and in chs. 4 and 5 we walk (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15) in His Body on the earth. Then in ch. 6 we stand in His power in the heavenlies. To sit with Christ is to participate in all His accomplishments; to walk in His Body is to fulfill God's eternal purpose; and to stand in His power is to fight against God's enemy. ",
  "5880":"The evil plan of the devil. ",
  "5881":"Blood and flesh refers to men. Behind men of blood and flesh are the evil forces of the devil, which are against God's purpose. Hence, our wrestling, our fighting, must not be against men but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. ",
  "5882":"The rulers, the authorities, and the world-rulers of this darkness are the rebellious angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world &#151; such as the prince of Persia and the prince of Greece in Dan. 10:20. This indicates that the devil, Satan, has his kingdom of darkness (Matt. 12:26; Col. 1:13), in which he occupies the highest position and in which the rebellious angels are under him. ",
  "5883":"This darkness refers to today's world, which is fully under the dark ruling of the devil, who rules through his evil angels. ",
  "5884":"Heavenlies here refers to the air (2:2). Satan and his spiritual forces of evil are in the air. But we are seated in the third heaven above them (2:6). In fighting a battle, the position above the enemy is very important strategically. Satan and his evil forces are under us, and they are destined to be defeated by us. ",
  "5885":"It is the whole armor of God, not just a part or some parts of it, that we need for the spiritual warfare. To take up the whole armor, the Body of Christ is needed; individual believers are not sufficient for this. ",
  "5886":"To withstand is to stand against. To stand is crucial in fighting. ",
  "5887":"Verse 16 in ch. 5 says that the days are evil. In this evil age every day is an evil day because Satan, the evil one, is at work every day. ",
  "5888":"In fighting we need to stand to the end. Having done all, we still must stand. ",
  "5889":"From this point to the end of v. 16 we are given a description of how to stand. ",
  "5890":"The girding of our loins is for the strengthening of our entire being. ",
  "5891":"According to the usage of this word in ch. 4 &#151; see notes 15 (on truth), 21 (on reality), and 24 (on reality) in ch. 4 &#151; truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God becoming our reality and experience in our living. This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us (John 14:6). Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for the spiritual warfare. ",
  "5892":"To put on the breastplate of righteousness is to cover our conscience, signified by the breast. Satan is the one who accuses us. In fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense. Regardless of how clear we feel our conscience is, it needs to be covered with the breastplate of righteousness. To be righteous is to be right with both God and man. If we are just a little wrong with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). ",
  "5893":"We shoe our feet to strengthen our stand in the battle. It is not for walking a way or running a course but for fighting the battle. ",
  "5894":"Firm foundation may also be rendered readiness. Here it means the establishing of the gospel of peace. Christ made peace for us, with both God and man, on the cross, and this peace has become our gospel (2:13-17). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Being thus shod, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ (2:14). ",
  "5895":"The shield of faith is taken up to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. ",
  "5896":"We need to have our loins girded with truth, our conscience covered with righteousness, our feet shod with peace, and our entire being protected with the shield of faith. If we live by God as reality (truth), we have righteousness (4:24), and righteousness issues in peace (Heb. 12:11; Isa. 32:17). Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the evil one's flaming darts. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith (Heb. 12:2). For us to stand firmly in the battle, we need to be equipped with all these four items of God's armor. ",
  "5897":"The flaming darts are Satan's temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks. Flaming darts were used by fighters in the apostle's time. The apostle used this term to illustrate Satan's attacks on us. ",
  "5898":"Receiving the helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot in by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God's salvation. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind. God's salvation is the covering that we take up against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life (John 16:33). ",
  "5899":"Among the six items of God's armor, this is the only one that is used for attacking the enemy. ",
  "5900":"The antecedent of which is Spirit, not sword, indicating that the Spirit is the word of God. Both the Spirit and the word are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon to defeat and slay the enemy. ",
  "5901":"The instant word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation. The sword, the Spirit, and the word are one. When the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word, that word is the Spirit as the sword that kills the enemy. ",
  "5902":"This phrase modifies the verb receive in v. 17, which tells us to receive not only the helmet of salvation but also the word of God. This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. We need to pray to receive the word of God. <br><br>   The whole armor of God is composed of six items. Prayer may be considered the seventh. It is the unique, crucial, and vital means by which we apply the other items, making the armor available to us in a practical way. ",
  "5903":"Prayer is general and petition is particular; both are needed that we might have a proper, overcoming church life. ",
  "5904":"This is our regenerated spirit, indwelt by the Spirit of God. It may be considered the mingled spirit &#151; the spirit that is our spirit mingled with God's Spirit. In praying, the main faculty that we should use is this spirit. ",
  "5905":"We need to be watchful, on the alert, for the maintaining of this prayer life. ",
  "5906":"To maintain a life of prayer, we need all perseverance, a constant, persistent care. ",
  "5907":"This indicates that we need to pray in a particular way for all the saints. ",
  "5908":"Or, word, speech, expression. ",
  "5909":"The mystery of the gospel is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose (5:32). See Rom. 16:25 and note 3. ",
  "5910":"An ambassador is one sent by a particular authority to contact certain people. Here this word implies that the apostle was one who was sent by God, the highest authority in the universe, to contact certain people. ",
  "5911":"A coupling chain, a chain that bound the prisoner to his guard. ",
  "5912":"A ministering servant. ",
  "5913":"This kind of fellowship is necessary and beautiful. Today such a loving concern between the apostles and the churches needs to be restored. ",
  "5914":"In the beginning of the book the apostle's greeting is first with grace as the enjoyment and then with peace as the result of the enjoyment (1:2). But in the conclusion the elements are presented vice versa, progressing from the result, peace, to the enjoyment, grace. After we have come into peace, we still need grace, indicating that our experience is from grace to grace.",
  "5915":"The reason the apostle inserted love between peace and grace is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love. Paul realized that love is crucial. He spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace. <br><br>   Love with faith is the means by which we partake of and experience Christ (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith is for receiving Him (John 1:12), and love is for enjoying Him (John 14:23). Here it is not faith and love nor love and faith, but love with faith. This indicates that we need faith as a match and support for our love. Love with faith is needed. This is the conclusion of the book on the church. The church needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which operates through love (Gal. 5:6). Love comes from God to us, and faith goes from us to God. By means of this traffic of love and faith, peace remains our portion. We are kept in peace by the coming of God's love to us and by the going of our faith to Him. This traffic also keeps us in the continual supply of grace, in the enjoyment of the Lord (v. 24). ",
  "5916":"Love is from God; it originates with God, not with us. Eventually, however, God's love becomes our love. God's love for us becomes our love for Him. ",
  "5917":"Grace is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God's eternal purpose and solves God's problem with His enemy. ",
  "5918":"The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is with those who love Him. In this book the phrase in love, which is rich in feeling, is used repeatedly (1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2). Later, the church in Ephesus was rebuked by the Lord because she had lost her first love toward Him (Rev. 2:4). One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ's wife. With the Body, the emphasis is on taking Christ as life; with the wife, the emphasis is on loving Christ. Therefore, this book emphasizes and also concludes with our love toward the Lord. The church in Ephesus, the recipient of this Epistle, failed in the matter of loving the Lord. Such a failure became the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages (Rev. 2--3). ",
  "5919":"For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility, that is, in and according to all the crucial things revealed and taught in the six chapters of this book, such as the church as the Body of Christ, the new man, the economy of God's mystery, the oneness of the Spirit, reality and grace, light and love, and the items of God's armor, all of which are incorruptible. For the sake of the church, our love toward the Lord must be in these incorruptible things. ",
  "5920":"Philippi was the chief city in the province of Macedonia of the ancient Roman Empire (Acts 16:12). Through Paul's first ministry journey to Europe (Acts 16:10-12), the first church in Europe was raised up in that city. ",
  "5921":"Here it is not \"the saints ... and the overseers and deacons\"; rather, it is \"the saints ... with the overseers and deacons.\" This is highly significant in that it indicates that in the local church the saints, the overseers, and the deacons are not three groups. The church has only one group, composed of all the saints (including the overseers and deacons), who are the components of a local church. This indicates further that in any locality there should be just one church with one group of people, comprising all the saints in that locality. ",
  "5922":"Overseers are the elders in a local church (Acts 20:17, 28). Elder denotes the person, and overseer the function. An overseer is an elder in function. Here overseers are mentioned instead of elders, indicating that the elders were fulfilling their responsibility. ",
  "5923":"The Greek word means serving ones. The deacons are the serving ones in a local church and are under the direction of the overseers (1 Tim. 3:8). This verse, showing that a local church is composed of the saints, with overseers to take the lead and deacons to serve, indicates that the church in Philippi was in good order. ",
  "5924":"See note 2 in Eph. 1. ",
  "5925":"See note 2 in Eph. 1. ",
  "5926":"Fellowship here means participation, communication. See note 26 in Rom. 15. The saints in Philippi had fellowship unto the gospel, participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry. This participation included their financial contributions to the apostle (4:10, 15-16), which issued in the furtherance of the gospel. This kind of fellowship, which kept them from being individualistic and diversely minded, implies that they were one with the apostle Paul and with one another. This gave them the ground for their experience and enjoyment of Christ, which is the main point of this book. The Christ-experiencing and -enjoying life is a life in the furtherance of the gospel, a gospel-preaching life, not individualistic but corporate. Hence, there is the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel. The more fellowship we have in the furtherance of the gospel, the more Christ we experience and enjoy. This kills our self, ambition, preference, and choice. ",
  "5927":"Concerning the gospel, in this book Paul used several significant terms: fellowship unto ...the gospel, the defense and confirmation of the gospel (v. 7), the advancement of the gospel (v. 12), and the faith of the gospel (v. 27). Paul's preaching of Christ as the gospel included fellowship, defense, confirmation, advancement, and the faith. In contrast, the Judaistic believers preached Christ out of rivalry, factiousness, selfish ambition, envy, and strife, and did not cause the gospel to advance. ",
  "5928":"On the negative side, the defense of the gospel is for the resisting of perverting and distorting heresies, such as Judaism, dealt with in Galatians, and Gnosticism, dealt with in Colossians. On the positive side, the confirmation of the gospel is for the announcing of the revelations of God's mysteries concerning Christ and the church as unveiled in the apostle's Epistles. In preaching such a gospel according to God's economy, Paul renounced religion, law, culture, ordinances, customs, habits, and every kind of \"ism\" &#151; everything that was apart from God's economy. Because Paul preached such a gospel, he was regarded as a troublemaker, a pest (Acts 24:5). ",
  "5929":"Fellow partakers of grace are those who share and enjoy the processed Triune God as grace. The apostle was such in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, and the saints in Philippi were fellow partakers with him in this grace. ",
  "5930":"Or, of my grace. Paul's grace was the grace that he enjoyed and that surpassed his sufferings in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. This grace was not God objectively; it was the Triune God processed to be his portion subjectively and experientially. ",
  "5931":"Lit., bowels; signifying inward affection, then, tender mercy and sympathy. In longing after the saints, the apostle was one with Christ even in the bowels, the tender inward parts, of Christ. This indicates that for Paul to enjoy Christ meant that he was one with Christ's inward parts, in which he enjoyed Christ as the supply of grace. ",
  "5932":"The Philippian believers had much love. Yet their love needed to abound, to overflow more and more, not foolishly but in full knowledge, not in ignorance but in all discernment, that they might approve by testing the things that differ and are more excellent. This should include the discerning of the differing preachings of the gospel in vv. 15-18 and of the different kinds of people in 3:2-3. ",
  "5933":"Sensitive perception, moral tact. Paul's desire was that the Philippians, some of whom had been distracted from God's economy by the preaching of the Judaistic believers, would not love the Judaistic believers foolishly but would love them soberly with love that abounded in full knowledge and sensitive perception. ",
  "5934":"The Greek word means judged by sunlight. I.e., tested as genuine; hence, pure, sincere. ",
  "5935":"Or, unoffending; not stumbling others. ",
  "5936":"The fruit of righteousness is the living product of the believers' living a proper life by the element of righteousness, with a righteous standing before God and man. Such a life could be lived not by the believers' natural man for their boast but through Jesus Christ as the believers' life, experienced by them to the glory and praise of God. ",
  "5937":"Advancement made by the pioneers who cut the way before an army to further its march. Paul's sufferings made such an advancement for the gospel. ",
  "5938":"I.e., for Christ's sake. ",
  "5939":"The imperial guard of Caesar. ",
  "5940":"Those Christians who were opposing Paul and his ministry (2 Cor. 10:7; 11:22-23). Even at the apostle's time there were some who preached the gospel out of envy of Paul and in strife with him. ",
  "5941":"Factiousness, partisanship. ",
  "5942":"Those who had fellowship with Paul and participated with him in the preaching of the gospel. ",
  "5943":"Self-seeking, rivalry, faction. ",
  "5944":"Lit., pressure. Those who announced Christ out of selfish ambition endeavored to make Paul's bonds press him more heavily by depreciating him and his ministry while he was outwardly laid aside from his preaching. Paul's affliction in bonds was due not to his preaching of the gospel but to his defense of the gospel. The Judaizers mixed the gospel with the law and circumcision. Paul defended it. This caused the riot which put him into bonds (Acts 21:27-36). ",
  "5945":"The apostle's heart was so broadened by grace that he even rejoiced in his opposers' preaching of Christ in pretense. What an upright spirit this is! This was the outworking of the life, nature, and mind of Christ, who lived in the apostle. His experience of Christ was an enjoyment. Such a life rejoices no matter what the circumstances may be. ",
  "5946":"The same Greek word as in 2:12. The salvation here is the working out of the salvation in 2:12; it means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ (see note 12 in ch. 2). This requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. ",
  "5947":"This is the supply of the Body of Christ, the church. Imprisonment did not isolate Paul from the Body of Christ or cut him off from the supply of the Body. ",
  "5948":"The Greek word refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus, the leader of the chorus. The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit enabled Paul to live and magnify Christ in his sufferings for Him. ",
  "5949":"The revelation in the Bible concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit is progressive. The Spirit is mentioned first as the Spirit of God, in relation to creation (Gen. 1:2). Then, He is mentioned as the Spirit of Jehovah, in the context of God's relationship with man (Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 10:6); as the Holy Spirit, in relation to the conception and birth of Christ (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20); as the Spirit of Jesus, in relation to the Lord's human living (Acts 16:7); as the Spirit of Christ, in relation to the Lord's resurrection (Rom. 8:9); and here as the Spirit of Jesus Christ. <br><br>   The Spirit of Jesus Christ is \"the Spirit\" mentioned in John 7:39. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord's incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord's resurrection, compounded with the Lord's incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in Exo. 30:23-25, a compound of olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here it is not the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7) or the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord's resurrection. To experience the Lord's humanity, as illustrated in 2:5-8, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord's resurrection, as mentioned in 3:10, we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering the apostle experienced both the Lord's suffering in His humanity and the Lord's resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has, and even is, the bountiful supply for a person like the apostle, who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before God's throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishing of His economy concerning the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). ",
  "5950":"In the apostle's suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, i.e., shown or declared to be great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. The apostle's sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. The apostle would have only Christ magnified in him, not the law or circumcision. This book is concerned with the experience of Christ. To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment. ",
  "5951":"Paul's life was to live Christ. To him to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision. He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ (3:9). Christ was not only his life but also his living. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him (Gal. 2:20). He was one with Christ in both life and living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within Paul as Paul's life, and Paul lived Christ without as Christ's living. The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances. ",
  "5952":"Gain here refers to being with Christ in a higher degree. But in fulfilling God's eternal purpose, being with Christ cannot compare with living Christ for His Body's sake. Hence, Paul chose to live Christ. ",
  "5953":"To be with Christ is a matter of degree, not place. Paul desired to be with Christ in a higher degree, although he was already with Him constantly. Through his physical death he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than he enjoyed in this earthly life. ",
  "5954":"The apostle's consideration was not selfish but was for the saints' sake. He was absolutely occupied by the Lord and the church. ",
  "5955":"Progress refers to the growth in life, and joy, to the enjoyment of Christ. ",
  "5956":"The faith here refers to what the saints believe in (Jude 3; 2 Tim. 4:7). ",
  "5957":"The Greek word means boasting, glorying, and rejoicing. ",
  "5958":"We need not only to stand firm in one spirit in order to experience Christ but also to strive together with one soul along with the faith of the gospel. To be of one soul for the gospel work is more difficult than to be in one spirit for the experience of Christ (see 2:20). To be of one soul requires that, after having been regenerated in our spirit, we go further and be transformed in our soul, especially in our mind, which is the main and leading part of our soul. ",
  "5959":"Like athletes. ",
  "5960":"The faith here is personified. The believers should strive together with one soul along with the personified faith (cf. note 8 in 2 Tim. 1). ",
  "5961":"Destruction of all that they are and do. ",
  "5962":"Salvation of all that you are and do. See notes 19 in ch. 1 and 12 in ch. 2. ",
  "5963":"This implies that the believer has an organic union with Christ through believing into Him. To believe into Christ is to have our being merged into His that we two may be one organically. ",
  "5964":"To suffer on behalf of Christ, after receiving Him and being made one with Him through believing, is to participate in, to have the fellowship of, His sufferings (3:10) that we may experience and enjoy Him in His sufferings. This is to live Him and magnify Him in a situation in which He is rejected and opposed. ",
  "5965":"Paul was a pattern set up by God's grace for His New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:14-16). The New Testament believers should experience and enjoy Christ by living and magnifying Him as Paul did in his sufferings for Christ, that they may be fellow partakers with Paul of grace. ",
  "5966":"In ch. 1 Paul, being rich in the experience of Christ, presented to the believers an account of his experience. Now in this chapter he asked the believers to have fellowship with him. Such a mutual fellowship of the believers and the apostle is needed for the experience of Christ. ",
  "5967":"Or, exhortation, encouragement. ",
  "5968":"I.e., inward affection. Lit., bowels. The same word as in 1:8. ",
  "5969":"In vv. 1-2 the apostle appealed to the Philippians for their encouragement and consolation. He begged them to make his joy full if they had any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions toward him. ",
  "5970":"Since this book is concerned with the experience and enjoyment of Christ, which issue in joy, it is a book filled with joy and rejoicing (1:4, 18, 25; 2:17-18, 28-29; 3:1; 4:1, 4). ",
  "5971":"Among the Philippians there was dissension in their thinking (4:2), which troubled the apostle. Hence, he asked them to think the same thing, even the same one thing, that they might make his joy full. ",
  "5972":"This indicates that because of the dissension in their thinking, the Philippian believers had different levels of love. They did not have the same love toward all the saints for the keeping of oneness. ",
  "5973":"This indicates that the dissension among the Philippians was due to their not being joined in soul, to their not thinking the one thing in their mind, the leading part of their soul. The Philippians' problem was not with their spirit but with their soul, that is, with their mind. They had Christ in their spirit through regeneration, but they did not have Christ in their soul through transformation. Only by having Christ saturate and occupy their entire soul could they be made one in soul. ",
  "5974":"According to the context of this book, the one thing here must refer to the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ (1:20-21; 2:5; 3:7-9; 4:13). Christ, and Christ alone, should be the centrality and universality of our entire being. Our thinking should be focused on the excellency of the knowledge and experience of Christ. Focusing on anything else causes us to think differently, thus creating dissensions among us. ",
  "5975":"This may indicate that the dissenting Philippians were doing things out of selfish ambition or vainglory, both of which cause dissensions among believers. ",
  "5976":"See note 17 in ch. 1. ",
  "5977":"Lowliness is in contrast to both selfish ambition and vainglory. This must be not our natural lowliness but the lowliness of Christ, as illustrated in vv. 7-8. ",
  "5978":"This indicates again that the problem of dissension among the Philippians was a matter of their untransformed mind. They needed to have the mind that was in Christ (see v. 5). ",
  "5979":"Lit., things; referring to virtues and qualities. We should regard not only our own virtues and qualities but also those of others. ",
  "5980":"Lit., think this in you. This refers to the considering in v. 3 and the regarding in v. 4. This kind of thinking, this kind of mind, was also in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man (vv. 7-8). To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts (1:8). To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to this extent, that is, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking. ",
  "5981":"In ch. 1 the central point is to magnify Christ, to live Christ (vv. 20-21). In ch. 2 it is to take Christ as our pattern, our model. This pattern is the standard of our salvation (v. 12). In vv. 5-16 there are four basic elements: Christ (v. 5), salvation (v. 12), God (v. 13), and the word of life (v. 16). The word of life works out the pattern by the operating God to apply salvation to our daily living. In this way we enjoy Christ and live Him, taking Him as our pattern. ",
  "5982":"The Greek word denotes existing from the beginning, implying the Lord's eternal preexistence. ",
  "5983":"The expression, not the fashion, of God's being (Heb. 1:3), identified with the essence and nature of God's person and, hence, expressing them. This refers to Christ's deity. ",
  "5984":"Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; rather, He laid aside the form of God (not the nature of God) and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave. ",
  "5985":"I.e., laid aside what He possessed &#151; the form of God. ",
  "5986":"The same word as that in v. 6. In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression, from the form of God, the highest form, to that of a slave, the lowest form. This was not a change of essence but of state. ",
  "5987":"I.e., entering into a new state. ",
  "5988":"The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ's deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity. He appeared to men as a man outwardly, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly. ",
  "5989":"When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man. ",
  "5990":"I.e., the outward guise, the semblance. This is a repetition, in a more particular sense, of the thought of likeness in v. 7. What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man. ",
  "5991":"Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself. Christ's self-humbling manifested His self-emptying. ",
  "5992":"The death of a cross is the climax of Christ's humiliation. To the Jews it was a curse (Deut. 21:22-23). To the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed on malefactors and slaves (Matt. 27:16-17, 20-23). Hence, it was a shameful thing (Heb. 12:2). <br><br>   The Lord's humiliation involved seven steps: (1) emptying Himself; (2) taking the form of a slave; (3) becoming in the likeness of men; (4) humbling Himself; (5) becoming obedient; (6) being obedient even unto death; and (7) being obedient unto the death of the cross. ",
  "5993":"The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak. ",
  "5994":"Lit., graciously bestowed; i.e., freely bestowed. ",
  "5995":"I.e., the name of Jesus, mentioned in the following verse. See Acts 9:5. Since the Lord's ascension, there has not been a name on this earth above the name of Jesus. ",
  "5996":"The name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His person and work. In the name of Jesus means in the sphere and element of all that the Lord is. It is in this way that we worship the Lord and pray to Him. ",
  "5997":"Lit., bend. ",
  "5998":"Those who are in heaven are angels. ",
  "5999":"Those who are on earth are men. ",
  "6000":"Those who are under the earth are the dead. ",
  "6001":"This is to call on the Lord or on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:9-10, 12-13). ",
  "6002":"God made the Lord Jesus, as a man, the Lord in His ascension (Acts 2:36). Thus, every tongue should confess that He is Lord. ",
  "6003":"I.e., resulting in. The result of our confessing that Jesus is Lord is that God the Father is glorified. This is the great end of all that Christ is and has done in His person and work (1 Cor. 15:24-28). ",
  "6004":"I.e., as a consequence of taking Christ as a pattern of obedience in the preceding verses. ",
  "6005":"This answers to becoming obedient in v. 8. ",
  "6006":"I.e., carry out, bring to the ultimate conclusion. We have received God's salvation, which has as its climax our being exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was (v. 9). We need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling. We have received this salvation by faith; now we must carry it out by obedience, which includes our being genuinely one in our soul (v. 2). To receive this salvation by faith is once for all; to carry it out is lifelong. ",
  "6007":"Not eternal salvation from God's condemnation and from the lake of fire but the daily salvation that is a living Person. This daily salvation results from taking the very Christ whom we live, experience, and enjoy as our inward as well as outward pattern. The main elements of this salvation are Christ as the crucified life (vv. 5-8) and Christ in His exaltation (vv. 9-11). When this pattern becomes the believers' inward life, the pattern becomes their salvation. Only this would make the apostle's joy full. <br><br>   In ch. 1 salvation comes through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, but here salvation comes from the operating God within us. The operating God is actually the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In both these cases salvation is a practical, daily, moment-by-moment salvation. The constant salvation in 1:19 is one in which a particular believer is saved from a specific encounter in a particular situation; whereas the constant salvation in 2:12 is one in which any believer is saved from ordinary things in common situations in his daily living. ",
  "6008":"Fear is the inward motive; trembling is the outward attitude. ",
  "6009":"For introduces the reason we need to obey always. The reason is that God operates in us. In God's economy we have the Lord Jesus as our pattern (vv. 6-11), as the standard of our salvation (v. 12), and we also have God operating in us both the willing and the working that our salvation may be carried out, brought to its ultimate conclusion. It is not that we by ourselves carry it out, but that God operates in us to do it. The only thing we need to do is to obey the inner operating God. ",
  "6010":"The God who operates in us is the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; the very God who is Christ in us (2 Cor. 13:3a, 5) and the Spirit in us (Rom. 8:11). The three &#151; the Spirit, God, and Christ &#151; are one. ",
  "6011":"Or, energizes. ",
  "6012":"The willing is within; the working is without. The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God's operation begins from our spirit (cf. 4:23) and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will. This corresponds with Rom. 8, where we see that God works from our spirit (Rom. 8:4), through our mind (Rom. 8:6), and eventually into our physical body (Rom. 8:11). ",
  "6013":"Or, acting. The same Greek word as for operates in this verse. ",
  "6014":"I.e., the good pleasure of His will (Eph. 1:5). God's good pleasure is that we may reach the climax of His supreme salvation. ",
  "6015":"Murmurings are of our emotion and come mainly from the sisters; reasonings are of our mind and come mainly from the brothers. Both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent and from experiencing and enjoying Christ to the uttermost. The context here indicates that murmurings and reasonings are due to disobedience to God. Obedience to God slays all murmurings and reasonings. ",
  "6016":"Or, simple, artless (not political), innocent (Matt. 10:16). The Greek root means unmixed. Blameless describes our outward behavior, and guileless our inward character. ",
  "6017":"As children of God, we have God's life and the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). ",
  "6018":"To be without blemish is the total quality of being blameless and guileless. ",
  "6019":"Lit., warped, twisted. ",
  "6020":"The Greek word refers to luminaries that reflect the light of the sun. As such luminaries, the believers shine in the world. They do not possess any light in themselves but have a heavenly ability to reflect the light of Christ. Christ is the sun, with the church as the moon and the believers as the planets to reflect Him by holding forth the word of life (v. 16). ",
  "6021":"The dark, corrupt world, which is usurped by Satan (1 John 5:19; 2:15-17). In the world can be rendered in the universe. ",
  "6022":"Lit., applying, presenting, offering. To hold forth the word of life is to apply it, to present it, and to offer it to the world by living out Christ. ",
  "6023":"Different from the doctrine of dead letters. The word of life is the living breath of God (2 Tim. 3:16), the Spirit who gives life (John 6:63). We have the Lord Jesus as our pattern (vv. 6-11), we have God operating in us (v. 13), we are God's children, having God's life and the divine nature (v. 15), we are luminaries qualified to reflect the divine light of Christ (v. 15), and we have the word of life to hold forth, to present, to others. What a divine and rich provision! By such we are well able to carry out God's salvation to its climax. ",
  "6024":"The way to make the apostle's joy full (v. 2) is to live a life that takes Christ as the pattern and carries out God's salvation fully, that the apostle may be able to boast, glory, and rejoice in the believers in the day of Christ. ",
  "6025":"The day of the Lord's second coming, which is called \"the day of the Lord\" (1 Thes. 5:2; 2 Thes. 2:2; 1 Cor. 1:8; 2 Cor. 1:14) and \"that day\" (2 Tim. 1:18; 4:8). In that day all believers will appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive the reward each deserves (2 Cor. 5:10; Matt. 25:19-30). ",
  "6026":"The drink offering was in addition to the basic offerings revealed in Lev. 1--6 (Num. 15:1-10; 28:7-10). The basic offerings are types of various aspects of Christ. The drink offering is a type of Christ as enjoyed by the offerer. Christ as the heavenly wine fills the offerer and even causes him to become wine to God. The apostle Paul became such a drink offering (2 Tim. 4:6) by enjoying Christ in this way, so that he could be poured out as a sacrifice to God upon the believers' faith through the shedding of his blood. ",
  "6027":"The sacrifice and service of your faith means that the faith of the Philippian believers was a sacrifice offered to God and also became their service to God. ",
  "6028":"Like the priestly service. Cf. note 25. ",
  "6029":"Faith here is all-inclusive and includes much more than the act of believing. It is the constitution and total expression of all that the believers have received, experienced, and enjoyed of Christ, including Christ as the basic offerings. Paul's ministry resulted in the all-inclusive faith of the believers. Such a faith was offered as a sacrifice to God by the believers, and Paul rejoiced even to be poured out as a drink offering upon such a sacrifice. ",
  "6030":"This means that the apostle rejoiced to have his blood shed as a drink offering upon the sacrifice of the believers' faith. ",
  "6031":"To rejoice together with means to share joy with. The apostle shared his joy with the Philippians in his being martyred for their faith. Hence, the phrase implies that he was congratulating them. ",
  "6032":"The apostle expected that the Philippians would share their joy with him by congratulating him in his being martyred for their faith's sake. ",
  "6033":"Or, of good comfort, of good cheer, refreshed. ",
  "6034":"This book deals very much with the believers' soul. We must strive together with one soul along with the personified faith of the gospel (1:27); we must be joined in soul, thinking the one thing (v. 2); and we must be like-souled, genuinely caring for the things of Christ Jesus (vv. 20-21). In the gospel work, in the fellowship among the believers, and in the pursuing of the Lord's interests, our soul is always a problem. Hence, it must be transformed, especially in its leading part, the mind (Rom. 12:2), that we may be of one soul, joined in soul, and like-souled in the Body life. ",
  "6035":"According to the context of this book, the things of Christ Jesus are the things concerning the church with all the saints. ",
  "6036":"I.e., approved worth, proof of having been tested. ",
  "6037":"Lit., served as a slave. ",
  "6038":"First a brother, then a fellow worker, and then a fellow soldier. ",
  "6039":"One sent with a commission. ",
  "6040":"Derived from the same Greek word as that for service in v. 17 and referring to a minister whose ministry is like that of a priest. All New Testament believers are priests to God (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly service (vv. 17, 30). ",
  "6041":"Venturing, recklessly exposing his life, like a gambler throwing down a stake. ",
  "6042":"Lit., soul. Epaphroditus was willing to risk his life for the churches and the saints. ",
  "6043":"See note 17; cf. note 25 in this chapter and note 3 in ch. 3. ",
  "6044":"Or, wearisome, tedious, troublesome. ",
  "6045":"To rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security. ",
  "6046":"I.e., ever keep a watchful eye on. On the one hand, the apostle advised the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord; on the other hand, he warned them to ever keep a watchful eye on the Judaizers. ",
  "6047":"Since no conjunction is used between any of these three clauses, they must refer to the same class of people. Dogs are unclean (Lev. 11:27), the evil workers are evil, and the concision are those deserving of contempt. (Concision meaning mutilation, is a contemptuous term for circumcision. See note 12 in Gal. 5.) The dogs here are the Judaizers. In nature the Judaizers are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame. In such a book concerning the experience and enjoyment of Christ, the apostle warned the Gentile believers to be wary of such unclean, evil, and contemptible people. ",
  "6048":"New Testament believers, genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion (see note 11 in Gal. 5 and note 11 in Col. 2). They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they do not have confidence in the flesh but in the Spirit. ",
  "6049":"The Greek word for serve here and the word for service in 2:17 refer to the priestly service. ",
  "6050":"In vv. 2 and 3 there is a threefold contrast: believers who serve by the Spirit of God, in contrast to the dogs; believers who boast in Christ, in contrast to evil workers; and believers who have no confidence in the flesh, in contrast to the concision. ",
  "6051":"The flesh here comprises all that we are and have in our natural being. The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh, not in the Spirit. ",
  "6052":"The day for a genuine Israelite to be circumcised (Gen. 17:12). Being circumcised on that day distinguished him from the Ishmaelites (Ishmael was circumcised thirteen years after his birth &#151; Gen. 17:25) and proselytes, who were circumcised on a later day. ",
  "6053":"God's called race, the genuine seed of Abraham (Rom. 11:1; 2 Cor. 11:22). Paul was not a descendant of the proselytes, who were grafted into the race of God's covenant. ",
  "6054":"A lovely and faithful tribe, among whom was the royal city of Jerusalem with the temple of God (Deut. 33:12). ",
  "6055":"A Hebrew born of Hebrew parents with Hebrew ancestry on both sides. ",
  "6056":"The law of Moses, which is respected by all orthodox Jews. ",
  "6057":"The Pharisees were the strictest sect of the Jewish religion (Acts 26:5; 23:6), a sect exceedingly zealous for the law of Moses. See note 7 in Matt. 3. ",
  "6058":"Zeal for the law of Moses and for the Jewish religion (Gal. 1:14 and note 1). ",
  "6059":"I.e., found or proven blameless. This was in the eyes of man, according to man's judgment. In the eyes of God, according to His righteous law, no flesh is blameless (Gal. 2:16b). ",
  "6060":"Verses 7 and 8 are the heart of this book. Here we are initiated into the experience of Christ. ",
  "6061":"The things mentioned in vv. 5-6. ",
  "6062":"All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, the loss of Christ, as indicated by on account of Christ. ",
  "6063":"All the things that were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in and enjoying Christ. Hence, on account of Christ all the gains were a loss to him. ",
  "6064":"Verses 8-11, being one long sentence, are like the ascending steps of a staircase, bringing us higher and higher until we reach the peak in v. 11. ",
  "6065":"Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion listed in vv. 5 and 6 but all other things as well. ",
  "6066":"The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His person. The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in human history; hence, they are zealous for the law. Paul participated in that zeal. But when Christ was revealed to him by God (Gal. 1:15-16), he saw that the excellency, the supereminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law. His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. On account of this, he counted as loss not only the law and the religion founded according to the law, but all things. ",
  "6067":"The phrase as to, which may be rendered according to, is used three times in vv. 5-6, with the law, zeal, and righteousness. The phrase on account of, which may be rendered because of, is used three times in vv. 7-8, with Christ (twice) and with the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Christ stands in contrast to the law, the zeal for it, and the righteousness in it. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all things and to the law. On account of Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul gave up the law, his zeal for it, the righteousness in it, and all other things. This indicates that Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ are far superior to the law and all things. ",
  "6068":"Referring to dregs, rubbish, filth, that which is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung. There is no comparison between such things and Christ. ",
  "6069":"To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him but to gain His very person. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and the reality of the shadows of all positive things (Col. 2:16-17). To gain something requires the paying of a price. To gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8) by paying a price. ",
  "6070":"Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law. But at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became \"a man in Christ\" (2 Cor. 12:2). Now he expected to be found in Christ by all who observed him &#151; the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ. Only when we are found in Christ will Christ be expressed and magnified (Phil. 1:20). ",
  "6071":"\"Not having my own righteousness ... but ... the righteousness which is out of God\" was the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ. He wanted to live not in his own righteousness but in the righteousness of God, and to be found in such a transcendent condition, expressing God by living Christ, not by keeping the law. ",
  "6072":"The righteousness that comes from man's own effort to keep the law, as mentioned in v. 6. ",
  "6073":"Lit., faith of Christ. See note 22 in Rom. 3. The faith with which we believe in Christ issues from our knowing and appreciating Christ. It is Christ Himself, infused into us through our appreciation of Him, who becomes our faith &#151; the faith in Him. Hence, it is the faith of Christ that brings us into an organic union with Him. ",
  "6074":"The righteousness that is God Himself lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ. Such righteousness is the expression of God, who lives in us. ",
  "6075":"I.e., on the basis or condition of faith. Faith is the basis, the condition, on which we receive and possess the righteousness that is out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). ",
  "6076":"Paul lived in a condition of having not his own righteousness but the righteousness that is out of God, in order to know (to experience) Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. In v. 8 to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is by revelation. But to know Him here is by experience &#151; to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ &#151; to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way. ",
  "6077":"The power of Christ's resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ's death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. To experience the power of Christ's resurrection, we need to live a crucified life, as He did. Our conformity to His death affords the power of His resurrection a base from which to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us. ",
  "6078":"The participation in Christ's sufferings (Matt. 20:22-23; Col. 1:24), a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection (2 Tim. 2:11) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24). ",
  "6079":"To take Christ's death as the mold of one's life. Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life the resurrection power of Christ is experienced and expressed. The mold of Christ's death refers to Christ's experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God (John 6:57). Our life should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life. Being conformed to the death of Christ is the condition for knowing and experiencing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. ",
  "6080":"I.e., arrive at. This requires us to triumphantly run the race for the prize (1 Cor. 9:24-26; 2 Tim. 4:7-8). ",
  "6081":"I.e., the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints. All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord's coming back (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52). But the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection. See note 35 in Heb. 11. <br><br>   To arrive at the out-resurrection indicates that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected. God first resurrected our deadened spirit (Eph. 2:5-6); then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul (Rom. 8:6) and our mortal body (Rom. 8:11), until our entire being &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; is fully resurrected out of our old being by and with His life. This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race that we must run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize. Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life. We can reach this goal only by being conformed to the death of Christ, by living a crucified life. In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new. ",
  "6082":"Paul had already obtained the believers' common salvation by the believers' common faith (1 Tim. 1:14-16), but he had not obtained the extra portion of resurrection. To obtain that portion he had to pursue, to run, and to finish his course triumphantly. ",
  "6083":"At his conversion. ",
  "6084":"In his present seeking. ",
  "6085":"Or, completed, mature (in life). ",
  "6086":"The same Greek word as for persecute, meaning also to press toward, to follow after. In such a way Paul ran the race to obtain the prize and reach maturity. Before he was saved, he persecuted Christ. After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent that he persecuted Christ, but in a positive way. ",
  "6087":"Gain, grasp, take possession of, seize. ",
  "6088":"At his conversion Paul was grasped, taken possession of, by Christ in order that he might grasp, take possession of, Christ. Christ gained him that he might gain Christ (v. 8). ",
  "6089":"Gained, grasped, taken possession of, seized. So in v. 13. ",
  "6090":"Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, yet he did not account of himself to have experienced Christ in full or gained Him to the uttermost. He still endeavored to pursue toward the goal &#151; the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent. ",
  "6091":"In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experiences in Judaism but also would not linger in his past experiences of Christ. He forgot the past. Not to forget but to linger in our past experiences, however genuine they were, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ. ",
  "6092":"Christ is unsearchably rich. There is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed. Paul was stretching out to reach the farthest extent of this territory. ",
  "6093":"See note 12. ",
  "6094":"The fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ. ",
  "6095":"The uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race. ",
  "6096":"To be called upward is for the obtaining of the prize to which God has called us from above, from the heavens. This heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1) corresponds with the heavenly commonwealth in v. 20. It is not an earthly calling like that given to the children of Israel in the flesh. This upward calling is to take possession of Christ, whereas the earthly calling to the children of Israel was to take possession of the physical land. ",
  "6097":"I.e., mature, perfect. Maturity is a stage. We may be mature but not mature in full. Full-grown here is used in a relative sense &#151; relatively mature, neither childish nor fully mature. Hence, further pursuing, further growth, is needed. ",
  "6098":"In this book the dealing with the Philippian believers is focused on the mind, the leading part of the soul. This book charges them to strive together with one soul along with the personified gospel (1:27), to think the same thing, to be joined in soul, even to think the one thing (2:2; 4:2), to let the mind that was in Christ be in them (2:5), and to have this one mind, a mind focused on the pursuing and gaining of Christ to the uttermost. When our mind is thus occupied, we have the same mind, thinking the same thing, even thinking the one thing &#151; the fullest gaining of Christ &#151; being joined in soul, like-souled (2:20), and made one soul. ",
  "6099":"The pursuing of Christ must be our goal. We should not be otherwise minded. God reveals to us that we need such a mind, a mind focused on the pursuing of Christ. He desires to continually adjust our mind, turning it toward Christ as the center. ",
  "6100":"This word concludes the preceding verses, charging us with only this one thing: to walk by the same rule. ",
  "6101":"Whereunto we have attained modifies walk. ",
  "6102":"Same line, same path, same steps. Paul's use of this word indicates that by the same path we should walk according to the elementary principle. ",
  "6103":"Gk. stoicheo, meaning to walk orderly, derived from steicho, which means to range in regular line, to march in military rank, to keep step, to conform to virtue and piety. The word is also used in Rom. 4:12 and Gal. 5:25; 6:16. It is different from the word walk in vv. 17 and 18, which means to live, to deport oneself, to be occupied with, to walk about, as used in Rom. 6:4; 8:4; 13:13; 1 Cor. 3:3; Gal. 5:16; and Eph. 4:1, 17. By this word the apostle charged us to walk and to order our lives &#151; whereunto we have attained, at the state to which we have attained &#151; by the same rule, in the same line, in the same path, in the same footsteps. Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk, as the apostle did, by the same rule, in the same path; that is, we must pursue Christ toward the goal that we may gain Christ to the fullest extent as the prize of the upward calling of God. See note 25 in Gal. 5. ",
  "6104":"Probably those who practiced the Epicurean philosophy, which promoted indulgence in the pleasure of eating and drinking and encouraged self-gratification in other things, all of which are contrary to the cross of Christ. Verse 2 shows that the Judaizers were a damage to the Philippian believers, and this verse, that the Epicureans were another kind of damage to them. The former was of Jewish origin; the latter, of a heathen source. <br><br>   Basically, the exhortation in this chapter was prompted by these two groups of people. In speaking of the Judaizers, it edified the Philippians concerning the matter of dealing with the soul (vv. 1-16), especially with the mind; and in alluding to the Epicureans, it instructed the believers concerning the matter of dealing with the body (vv. 17-21). To deal with the soul we must count as refuse all religious, philosophical, and cultural things. In dealing with the body, we should take care of our physical need but should not indulge in excessive physical enjoyment. ",
  "6105":"The cross of Christ terminated the indulgence of the lusts of the physical body (Gal. 5:24). ",
  "6106":"The Epicureans, who worshipped their belly and served their stomach. In promoting the enjoyment of eating and drinking, they were more concerned with physical indulgence and enjoyment than with ethics or morality. Their stomach was their god. ",
  "6107":"Physical things, material things, matters of eating and drinking. We need things such as food and clothing; however, we should not indulge ourselves in these things. ",
  "6108":"Or, citizenship. The Greek word denotes commonwealth, associations of life. ",
  "6109":"In contrast to earthly in the preceding verse. Those who practiced the Epicurean philosophy set their mind on earthly things, but our commonwealth is in the heavens. ",
  "6110":"The transfiguration of our body is the ultimate consummation of God's salvation. In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit (John 3:6), now is transforming our soul (Rom. 12:2), and consummately will transfigure our body, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being. ",
  "6111":"Our natural body, made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). ",
  "6112":"Christ's resurrected body, saturated with God's glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9). ",
  "6113":"The transfiguring of our body is accomplished by the Lord's great power, which subjects all things to Himself (Eph. 1:19-22). This is the almighty power in the universe. ",
  "6114":"Joy is inward; a crown is manifested outwardly. The believers were the apostle's inward happiness and outward glory. ",
  "6115":"In the way presented by the apostle in the foregoing chapter. ",
  "6116":"This indicates that the two sisters were dissenting from each other; they were not of the same mind. Hence, there was the exhortation in this book to strive together with one soul along with the personified gospel (1:27), to be joined in soul, thinking the one thing (2:2), and to have the same mind to pursue Christ (3:14-15). ",
  "6117":"Referring to two oxen pulling a plow; used as a metaphor. Yokefellow refers to being yoked together with another to bear a common burden. ",
  "6118":"Assist them to think the same thing in the Lord, and thereby to be one. ",
  "6119":"Labor with, strive together with, wrestle in company with, as a team of athletes. ",
  "6120":"A heavenly record of the redeemed in Christ. ",
  "6121":"Rejoicing affords us the strength for the oneness spoken of in vv. 2 and 3. Furthermore, rejoicing in the Lord is the secret of having the excellent virtues listed in vv. 5-9. ",
  "6122":"The apostle's charge in vv. 5-9 should be the outward expression of the inner reality of the experience of Christ spoken of by him in chs. 1--3. ",
  "6123":"I.e., reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, not being strict in claiming one's legal rights. It is in contrast to selfish ambition and vainglory (2:3) and to murmurings and reasonings (2:14). It is Christ Himself as an excellent virtue lived out of the believers. ",
  "6124":"Near in space and time. With respect to space, the Lord is near us, ready to help. With regard to time, the Lord is at hand, coming soon. ",
  "6125":"I.e., worry. Anxiety, coming from Satan, is the sum total of human life and disturbs the believers' life of living Christ; forbearance, coming from God, is the sum total of a life that lives Christ. The two are opposites. ",
  "6126":"Prayer is general, having worship and fellowship as its essence; petition is special, being for particular needs. ",
  "6127":"Not and but with. Both our prayer and our petition should be accompanied by our giving thanks to the Lord. ",
  "6128":"The Greek word is often translated with (John 1:1; Mark 9:19; 2 Cor. 5:8; 1 John 1:2). It denotes motion toward, in the sense of a living union and communion, implying fellowship. Hence, the sense of to God here is in the fellowship with God. ",
  "6129":"The result of practicing fellowship with God in prayer is that we enjoy the peace of God. The peace of God is actually God as peace (v. 9) infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer, as the counterpoise to troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33). ",
  "6130":"Or, mount guard over. The God of peace patrols before our hearts and thoughts in Christ, keeping us calm and tranquil. ",
  "6131":"The heart is the source; the thoughts are the issue. ",
  "6132":"Truthful ethically. It does not mean true in matter of fact. ",
  "6133":"I.e., venerable, worthy of reverence, noble, grave; implying the idea of dignity, which inspires and invites reverence. ",
  "6134":"Right, not just, before God and man. ",
  "6135":"I.e., single in intention and action, without any mixture. ",
  "6136":"I.e., lovable, agreeable, endearing. ",
  "6137":"I.e., of good repute, attractive, winning, gracious. ",
  "6138":"Meaning excellence, that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action. See notes 3 and 5 in 2 Pet. 1. ",
  "6139":"I.e., things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue. The first six items are categorized under what things are; the last two, under if any. This indicates that the last two items are a summing up of the first six, in all of which are some virtue or excellence and something worthy of praise. ",
  "6140":"Think about, ponder, consider. ",
  "6141":"Not only learned but also received. ",
  "6142":"Not only heard but also seen. ",
  "6143":"Not only should the believers think about the things mentioned in v. 8; they should also practice the things they have learned, received, heard, and seen in the apostle. ",
  "6144":"The God of peace is the source of all the things mentioned in vv. 8 and 9. By our fellowshipping with Him and having Him with us, all these virtues will issue forth in our life. ",
  "6145":"The Greek word means to sprout and bloom, implying that the Philippian believers' thinking toward the apostle was a matter of life. For some time their thinking for Paul had been dormant. But when Paul wrote this Epistle, their thinking for him had begun to blossom anew, just like a plant's sprouting and blooming. ",
  "6146":"Self-sufficient, satisfied in oneself. This is a word used by the Stoics, who taught that a person should be content in all circumstances. Being content is the opposite of the Epicurean practice referred to in 3:18-19. ",
  "6147":"Humbled, in lowly circumstances. ",
  "6148":"To live in abundance. ",
  "6149":"In everything means in each matter; in all things means in all matters. Together, these two phrases encompass all the things in the course of human life. Paul learned the secret of experiencing Christ &#151; to experience Him in everything and in every place. ",
  "6150":"Lit., I have been initiated. The metaphor here refers to a person's being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles. After Paul was converted to Christ, he was initiated into Christ and the Body of Christ. He then learned the secret of how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, how to gain Christ, and how to have the church life, all of which things are rudimentary principles. ",
  "6151":"Satisfied. ",
  "6152":"To have abundance, sufficiency, more than enough. ",
  "6153":"To be in want, to suffer privation. ",
  "6154":"Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others. Now he declared that he was able to do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word on his experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord's word in John 15:5 concerning our organic relationship with Him, \"Apart from Me you can do nothing.\" ",
  "6155":"The Greek word means makes dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic from within, not from without. By such inward empowering Paul was able to do all things in Christ. ",
  "6156":"This was the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel (1:5), by their supplying of material things to the apostle (v. 18). ",
  "6157":"Referring to Paul's imprisonment (1:17). ",
  "6158":"This fellowshipping (sharing) is the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel mentioned in 1:5 and 4:14. ",
  "6159":"The Philippian believers' supplying of material things to the apostle opened an account with the apostle. ",
  "6160":"The supplying and receiving of material things to meet the apostle's need in his gospel work. ",
  "6161":"The church in Philippi was a unique example in the supplying of the sent one's needs for the furtherance of the gospel. ",
  "6162":"The material things given to the Lord's servant for the Lord's interests. ",
  "6163":"The result of their fellowship, participation, in the apostle's gospel work. This will be a reward in the day of the Lord. ",
  "6164":"The account opened in v. 15. We should follow the Philippians' example by opening such an account and keeping its credit side continually increasing in the fruit of our giving. ",
  "6165":"Fully supplied. ",
  "6166":"The material things given as a supply to the apostle. ",
  "6167":"The same Greek phrase as in Eph. 5:2. A sweet-smelling odor of sacrifices offered to God (Gen. 8:21). ",
  "6168":"The Philippians' material gift, given to supply the apostle's need, was considered by him a sacrifice to God, acceptable and well pleasing (Heb. 13:16). Paul indicated in his appreciation that what the Philippians did toward him was done toward God. This implies that he had the assurance that he was one with God and that his work was by God and for God. ",
  "6169":"The apostle in his experience had the conviction and assurance that he was one with God and that God was his God. Since he considered the Philippians' material gift to him a sacrifice to God, he believed with assurance that God, who was one with him and who was his God, would richly repay the Philippians. ",
  "6170":"Fully supply, satisfy to the full. ",
  "6171":"Since the Philippians cared for God's sent one, God would care for their every need. ",
  "6172":"God supplies us according to His riches, not according to our needs. His riches exceed our needs. ",
  "6173":"In glory modifies fill. Glory is the expression of God; it is God expressed in splendor. God's rich supply to the believers, who are His children, expresses God and bears the glory of God. The apostle assured the Philippians that God would abundantly supply all their needs in a way that would bring them into His glory. ",
  "6174":"In Christ Jesus also modifies fill. Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the base, the element, the sphere, and the channel in and by which God cares for His people according to His riches and in glory. This indicates that even the believers' giving and receiving of material things are intimately related to the experience of Christ. ",
  "6175":"God is not only the apostle's God but also the believers'. ",
  "6176":"Glory is God expressed in His splendor and excellency for our appreciation. For glory to be to God means that God is expressed in this way. Our giving in Christ, which is to God for God's interests, brings in God's glory, not only for our enjoyment but also for God's glorification. ",
  "6177":"See note 13 in Matt. 6. ",
  "6178":"Caesar's household comprised all who were attached to the palace of Nero. Some of these were converted through contact with Paul and became believers in Christ in Rome. ",
  "6179":"God in Christ as our supply and enjoyment, conveyed to us and realized through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (1:19). To experience Christ as Paul did, we need this grace. ",
  "6180":"Our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of Christ. It is in this spirit of ours that we experience and enjoy Christ as Paul did. <br><br>   This book, which is concerned with the experience of Christ, points out to us at the beginning, in ch. 1, that it is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that enables us to live Christ, even to magnify Christ under any circumstances, that we may enjoy Him as the uttermost salvation. Here, at the end of the book, we are told that our experience and enjoyment of Christ must take place in our spirit, which has been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God. Therefore, this is altogether a matter of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God, who has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, and the spirit of us, the tripartite men, who are being transformed by such a Spirit. We must live and act in our wonderful spirit by the Triune God as the wonderful Spirit. Only then can we experience and enjoy the Triune God, who was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, as the inexhaustibly sufficient grace and thus become His fullness, His expression. ",
  "6181":"The background of this book is that culture had been mixed into the church life in Colossae. Originally, Christ was the unique element in the church life, yet at that time a disturbance was created because Christ was being replaced by culture. The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, yet the church had been invaded by certain elements of culture &#151; especially religion, in the form of asceticism related to Judaic ordinances and observances (2:16, 20-21), and philosophy, in the form of mysticism related to Gnosticism and the worship of angels (2:8, 18). Hence, the central concept of this book is that nothing should be allowed to replace Christ. <br><br>   This book concentrates on Christ as the Head of the Body. It reveals the profoundness, all-inclusiveness, and unlimitedness of Christ to a fuller extent than any other book in the Bible. ",
  "6182":"See note 1 in Eph. 1. ",
  "6183":"I.e., the holy ones, those separated and sanctified unto God. They were living in Colossae, but they were separated from the world. ",
  "6184":"See note 3 in Eph. 1. ",
  "6185":"To have faith is to substantiate and receive what is in Christ, to love is to experience and enjoy what we have received of Christ, and to hope (v. 5) is to expect and wait for the glorification in Christ. ",
  "6186":"Hope, faith, and love, mentioned in vv. 4 and 5, are the three things that the apostle stressed in 1 Cor. 13:13. The emphasis there was on love because of the Corinthians' situation; the emphasis here is on hope, which, strictly speaking, is Christ Himself (v. 27), that Christ may be revealed as everything to us. ",
  "6187":"It is by living and experiencing Christ that we lay up hope in the heavens. The more we live and experience Christ, the more we lay up hope in the heavens. Hence, hope is being laid up now in our daily life. ",
  "6188":"The truth of the gospel is the reality, the real facts, not the doctrine, of the gospel. \"The word\" may be considered the doctrine of the gospel, but \"the truth\" must refer to reality. Christ, in His all-inclusive person and His multifaceted redemptive work, is the reality of the gospel. ",
  "6189":"The grace of God is what God is to us and what God gives to us in Christ (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10). ",
  "6190":"Truth here means reality (see point 8 of note 6 in 1 John 1). To know the grace of God in truth is to know it experientially in its reality, not just mentally in vain words or doctrines. ",
  "6191":"A minister of Christ is not only a servant of Christ, one who serves Christ, but a serving one who serves others with Christ by ministering Christ to them. ",
  "6192":"Here God's will is His will regarding His eternal purpose, regarding His economy concerning Christ (Eph. 1:5, 9, 11), not His will regarding minor things. ",
  "6193":"Spiritual wisdom and understanding are of the Spirit of God in our spirit, in contrast to Gnostic philosophy, which is merely in the darkened human mind. Wisdom is in our spirit and is for us to perceive God's eternal will; spiritual understanding is in our mind, renewed by the Spirit, and is for us to understand and interpret what we perceive in our spirit. ",
  "6194":"Walking worthily of the Lord issues from having the full knowledge of God's will. Such a worthy walk is a walk in which we live Christ. ",
  "6195":"I.e., in all ways. ",
  "6196":"Here bearing fruit refers to living Christ, growing Christ, expressing Christ, and propagating Christ in every respect. This is the real essence of every Christian good work. ",
  "6197":"Not knowledge in letters in the mind but the living knowledge of God in spirit, by means of which we grow in life. ",
  "6198":"This power is not only the power of Christ's resurrection (Phil. 3:10) but Christ Himself as a dynamo that empowers us in all things (Phil. 4:13) unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy that we may have a living in which we experience and live Christ. ",
  "6199":"The might that expresses God's glory, glorifying God in His might. ",
  "6200":"God the Father has qualified us by the redemption of God the Son and through the sanctification of God the Spirit for a share of the all-inclusive Christ, the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, as the allotted portion of the saints. ",
  "6201":"This refers to the lot of the inheritance, as illustrated by the allotment of the good land of Canaan given to the children of Israel for their inheritance (Josh. 14:1). The New Testament believers' inheritance, their allotted portion, is not a physical land; it is the all-inclusive Christ. He is the allotted portion of the saints as their divine inheritance for their enjoyment. ",
  "6202":"Light here is in contrast to darkness in the next verse. When we were under Satan's authority, we were in darkness. But now we are in the kingdom of the Son of God's love, enjoying Him in light. ",
  "6203":"For Christ to be the Head of the Body, and for us, His believers, to be the members of His Body, God needed to deliver us out of the authority of darkness, the kingdom of Satan (Matt. 12:26b), and transfer us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. This is to qualify us to partake of the all-inclusive Christ as our allotted portion. ",
  "6204":"Lit., the darkness. ",
  "6205":"The Son is the expression of the Father as the source of life (John 1:4, 18; 1 John 1:2). The beloved Son as the object of the Father's love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love. ",
  "6206":"Deliverance, mentioned in the preceding verse, deals with Satan's authority over us by destroying his evil power, whereas redemption, mentioned in this verse, deals with our sins by fulfilling God's righteous requirement. ",
  "6207":"The forgiveness of sins is the redemption that we have in Christ. Christ's death accomplished redemption unto the forgiveness of our sins. ",
  "6208":"God is invisible. But the Son of His love, who is the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance (Heb. 1:3), is His image, expressing what He is. The image here is not a physical form but an expression of God's being in all His attributes and virtues (see note 6 in Phil. 2). This interpretation is confirmed by 3:10 and 2 Cor. 3:18. ",
  "6209":"Christ as God is the Creator. However, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14a), He is part of the creation. Firstborn of all creation refers to Christ's preeminence in all creation, because from this verse through v. 18 the apostle stresses the first place that Christ has in all things. ",
  "6210":"In Him here means in the power of Christ's person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. All creation bears the characteristics of Christ's intrinsic power. ",
  "6211":"Thrones refers to those who are in authority on the throne. ",
  "6212":"See note 21 in Eph. 1. ",
  "6213":"Through Him indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished in sequence. ",
  "6214":"Or, for Him. This indicates that Christ is the end of all creation. All things were created unto Him for His possession. In, through, and unto indicate that creation is subjectively related to Christ. The creation was created in Him, through Him, and unto Him. ",
  "6215":"This indicates Christ's eternal preexistence. ",
  "6216":"Or, subsist together in Him. To cohere in Christ is to exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center. ",
  "6217":"Verses 15-17 unveil Christ as the first in creation, as the One who has preeminence among all creatures. Verse 18 shows that Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body. As such, He has the first place in the church, God's new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). ",
  "6218":"All the fullness refers to the fullness in both the old creation and the new creation. ",
  "6219":"The word fullness has no modifier, indicating that this fullness is the unique fullness. It denotes not the riches of what God is but the expression of those riches. The full expression of the rich being of God, in both creation and the church, dwells in Christ. All creation and the whole church are filled with Christ as the expression of God's riches. Such a fullness is pleased with this. This is pleasant to Christ. <br><br>   The fullness in this verse refers to the image of God in v. 15, who is Christ, a living person. Such a fullness is pleased to dwell in the expression of God and to reconcile all things to the expression of God. ",
  "6220":"Through Him means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was accomplished. ",
  "6221":"Not \"all people\" but \"all things,\" referring not only to human beings but also to all creatures, which were created in Christ and now subsist, cohere, in Him (vv. 16-17) and are reconciled to God through Him. ",
  "6222":"Himself here refers to the fullness in v. 19. ",
  "6223":"To reconcile all things to Himself is to make peace with Himself for all things. This was accomplished through the blood of the cross of Christ. ",
  "6224":"Not only things on the earth but also things in the heavens needed to be reconciled to God. This indicates that things in the heavens also are wrong with God because of the rebellion of Satan, the archangel, and the angels who followed him. His rebellion has contaminated the heavens. ",
  "6225":"Because we were sinners, we needed redemption. Because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation. ",
  "6226":"Our enmity toward God was mainly in our corrupted mind. ",
  "6227":"Both He and Him refer to the fullness in v. 19. It is the fullness that dwells in Christ (v. 19), it is the fullness that reconciles us to Himself (v. 20), and it is to the fullness that we will be presented. This fullness is God Himself expressed in Christ. ",
  "6228":"Not our act of believing but the object of our belief. ",
  "6229":"Christ in us the hope of glory (v. 27), from whom we should not be moved away. ",
  "6230":"The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers. ",
  "6231":"Referring to the church in the preceding verse, indicating that Paul became a minister not of a certain teaching, preaching, or mission work but of the church, the Body of Christ, for its building up. ",
  "6232":"In Greek, the same word as that for deacon, meaning one who serves. ",
  "6233":"See note 2 in Eph. 3. ",
  "6234":"The word of God is the divine revelation, which had not been completed before the New Testament was written. In the New Testament the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, completed the word of God in regard to the mystery of God, which is Christ, and the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God's economy. ",
  "6235":"According to Greek grammar, the mystery in this verse is in apposition to the word of God in v. 25, showing that the mystery is the word of God. This mystery concerns Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32), the Head and the Body. The unveiling of this mystery through the apostle Paul is the completing of the word of God as the divine revelation. ",
  "6236":"From the ages means from eternity, and from the generations means from the times. The mystery concerning Christ and the church was hidden from eternity and from all the times until the New Testament age, when it was manifested to the saints, including all of us, the believers in Christ. ",
  "6237":"The riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles are the riches of all that Christ is to the Gentile believers (Eph. 3:8). ",
  "6238":"Which refers to this mystery. This mystery, full of glory among the Gentiles, is Christ in us. Christ as life in us is mysterious as well as glorious. ",
  "6239":"Christ, who dwells in our spirit to be our life and person, is our hope of glory. When He comes, we will be glorified in Him. This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being that our physical body may be transfigured and conformed to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). ",
  "6240":"In this book a number of important phrases point to our experience of Christ: Christ in you (v. 27), full-grown in Christ (v. 28), walk in Him (2:6), according to Christ (2:8), made alive together with Him (2:13), died with Christ (2:20), holding the Head (2:19), out from whom (2:19), and grows with the growth of God (2:19). These expressions give us a complete picture of the proper experience of Christ. ",
  "6241":"Christ is the mystery that is full of glory now. This glory will be manifested to its fullest extent when Christ returns to glorify His saints (Rom. 8:30). Hence, it is a hope, the hope of glory. Christ Himself is also this hope of glory. ",
  "6242":"Or, perfect, complete, mature. Perfect denotes full in quality, whereas complete denotes full in quantity. The apostle's ministry, whether in announcing Christ or in admonishing and teaching men in all wisdom, was altogether to minister Christ to men that they might become perfect and complete by maturing with Christ as the element of the divine life unto full growth. ",
  "6243":"The preceding verse says that Christ is in us; this verse, that we are in Christ. First, we are put into Christ; then Christ is in us. The more we get into Christ, the more He comes into us, and the more He comes into us, the more we get into Him. It is by this cycle that we grow in life. ",
  "6244":"Or, contending (as in wrestling). So also in 4:12. ",
  "6245":"See notes 7 and 20 in Eph. 3. ",
  "6246":"To comfort people's hearts is to cherish people and lovingly warm them up, that they may be knit together unto the full assurance of understanding of the mystery of God. ",
  "6247":"The divine love that we have enjoyed and by which we love God's beloved. This love is the factor and element that knits the saints together. ",
  "6248":"The riches of the full assurance of understanding equal the full knowledge of the mystery of God, which is Christ. ",
  "6249":"To be knit together in love involves the emotion, whereas to have the riches of the full assurance of understanding involves the mind. When our hearts have been comforted, we being knit together in love, and our minds function properly, we will have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God. ",
  "6250":"The book of Ephesians concerns the mystery of Christ, which is the church, the Body (Eph. 3:4). This book concerns the mystery of God, which is Christ, the Head. ",
  "6251":"According to history, the influence of Gnostic teaching, which included Greek philosophy, invaded the Gentile churches in Paul's time. Hence, the apostle told the Colossians that all the treasures of genuine wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ. This is the spiritual wisdom and knowledge of the divine economy concerning Christ and the church. Wisdom is related to our spirit, and knowledge is related to our mind (Eph. 1:8, 17). ",
  "6252":"In order for believers to be deluded, or carried off as spoil, something close to the truth, such as philosophy, must be used to deceive them. If we have a clear vision of Christ as the center of God's economy, no one will be able to delude us (v. 8). If we take Christ as life (3:4), hold Him as the Head of the Body (v. 19), know Him as the mystery of God (v. 2), experience Him as the hope of glory (1:27), and walk in Him as the all-inclusive Spirit (2:6), we will not be deceived by anything or anyone. ",
  "6253":"We should beware of persuasive speech and of eloquence. A speaker may be very persuasive and very eloquent, but the reality of Christ may not be in his persuasive and eloquent speech. ",
  "6254":"The human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit. ",
  "6255":"Lit., into. ",
  "6256":"Christ is the allotted portion of the saints (1:12) for their enjoyment. To believe into Him is to receive Him. As the all-inclusive Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He enters into us and dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) to be everything to us. ",
  "6257":"As we have received Christ, we should walk in Him. Here to walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. We should walk, live, and act in Christ that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land, enjoying all its rich produce. The good land today is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit (Gal. 3:14), who dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16) to be our enjoyment. To walk according to this Spirit (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16) is the central and crucial point in the New Testament. ",
  "6258":"Like plants, we are living organisms. As such, we have been rooted in Christ, our soil, our earth, that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment. These riches become the element and substance with which we grow and are built up. To be rooted is for the growth in life. This rooting has been completed already. To be built up is for the building of the Body of Christ. This is still going on. Both these matters are in Christ. ",
  "6259":"In the faith here means in our faith, the subjective faith by which we believe. ",
  "6260":"This refers to Gnostic teaching, a mixture of Jewish, oriental, and Greek philosophies, which is an empty deceit. ",
  "6261":"Tradition is related to culture and has its source in culture. The source of the Gnostic teaching at Colossae was the tradition of men; it was based not on the revealed writings of God but on the traditional practices of men. ",
  "6262":"The same expression, elements of the world, is used in Gal. 4:3 (see note there). Here it refers to the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, consisting of ritualistic observances regarding the eating of meats, drinking, washings, asceticism, and other matters. ",
  "6263":"Christ is the governing principle of all genuine wisdom and knowledge, the reality of all genuine teaching, and the only measure of all concepts acceptable to God. This book focuses on Christ as our everything. ",
  "6264":"Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is. See note 19 in Eph. 3. ",
  "6265":"This refers to deity, which is different from the divine characteristics manifested by the created things (Rom. 1:20). This strongly indicates the deity of Christ. The fullness of the Godhead is versus the tradition of men and the elements of the world. The world's tradition and elements simply cannot be compared with the fullness of the Godhead. ",
  "6266":"This points to the physical body that Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as One who has a human body. Before Christ's incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way; and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells. ",
  "6267":"The Greek word implies completion, perfection. Because all the fullness dwells in Him, after we have been put into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we are made full, filled up, with all the divine riches. Hence, we need no other source. Because Christ is our perfection and completion, we do not need other rules and authorities as objects of adoration, for He is the Head of all these. This is versus angel worship (v. 18). ",
  "6268":"The rule and authority here are the fallen angels occupying positions of power in the air in subordination to Satan. See note 15. ",
  "6269":"This is spiritual circumcision, the circumcision of Christ, referring to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ. This is contrary to asceticism (vv. 20-22). ",
  "6270":"The circumcision that is the putting off of the body of the flesh was not made with hands; it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit. ",
  "6271":"Putting off here means to strip off something, as one would strip off clothes. ",
  "6272":"To be buried in baptism is to put off, to strip off, the body of the flesh. ",
  "6273":"In baptism there is the aspect of burial, which is the termination of our flesh, and the aspect of raising, which is the germination of our spirit. In the aspect of raising, we are made alive in Christ with the divine life. ",
  "6274":"Faith is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God (2 Pet. 1:1). The more we turn to God and contact Him, the more faith we have. The Lord is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). The more we abide in Him, the more we are infused with Him as our faith. It is through this living faith produced by the operation of the living God that we experience the resurrection life, signified by the raising aspect of baptism. ",
  "6275":"Dead in spirit because of sin. ",
  "6276":"In Christ's resurrection, God enlivened us together by His divine life. This was accomplished in Christ's resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3) and is experienced through our faith. ",
  "6277":"Or, blotting out, obliterating, erasing, annulling (a decree of law). ",
  "6278":"A legal document, a bond. Here it refers to the written law. ",
  "6279":"Referring to the ordinances of the ceremonial law with its rituals, which are the forms or ways of living and worship. So also in vv. 20 and 21. ",
  "6280":"This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). It kills the heresy of keeping the Judaic rituals. ",
  "6281":"Or, putting off, as in 3:9. Verses 13-15 unveil the economy of God's salvation: (1) to make us alive with Christ, (2) to abolish the ordinances of the ceremonial law, and (3) to strip off the evil angelic powers. <br><br>   God was busy while Christ's crucifixion was going on: He nailed the law on the cross and stripped off the rulers and authorities, that the way and the atmosphere might be cleared for us to enter into the participation in Christ. ",
  "6282":"These are the angelic rulers and authorities. Because at Colossae there was the heretical teaching of angel worship, the passage here must refer to the evil angels. The law was ordained through angels and was even considered to be ordinances of angels (Gal. 3:19; Acts 7:53). Based on this, the heresy at Colossae taught people to worship angels (v. 18) as mediators between God and man. The apostle dealt with this heresy by unveiling the fact that the law, consisting of ordinances, had been nailed to the cross (v. 14), and that the leading evil angels had been stripped off from God. This left Christ as the sole Mediator, who is the Head of all rule and authority (v. 10). This killed the heresy of angel worship. ",
  "6283":"Here and throughout vv. 13 and 14, He refers to God (v. 12). ",
  "6284":"Or, show, exhibit in the sense of an open shame. God openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it. ",
  "6285":"Or, in Him; referring to Christ. It refers to the cross. ",
  "6286":"Or, in food and in drink. Food and drink signify satisfaction and strengthening. ",
  "6287":"Referring to the annual Jewish festivals, which signify joy and enjoyment. ",
  "6288":"Signifying a new beginning with light in the darkness. ",
  "6289":"Signifying completion and rest. Feasts are yearly, new moons monthly, Sabbaths weekly, and eating and drinking daily. Daily we eat and drink Christ, weekly we have completion and rest in Him, monthly we experience a new beginning in Him, and throughout the year He is our joy and enjoyment. Therefore, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing, implying the universal extensiveness of the all-inclusive Christ. ",
  "6290":"All the aforementioned items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come. But the body belongs to Christ and is Christ. ",
  "6291":"As with a man's physical body, the body here is the substance. And like the shadow of a man's body, the rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel. ",
  "6292":"Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Him and are Him. This book unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God's economy. ",
  "6293":"The heretical teachers judged the saints unworthy to worship God directly and maintained that they had to approach Him through the mediation of angels. This was to defraud the saints of their prize, depriving them of the enjoyment of Christ. In Christ, our sole Mediator, we can worship God directly. ",
  "6294":"The heretical teachers of angel worship taught the saints to show lowliness in realizing that they were not worthy to worship God directly. They defrauded the saints of their prize in Christ in the element and sphere of such self-chosen lowliness and angel worship. ",
  "6295":"Or, looking into, investigating (secret things). ",
  "6296":"The heretical teachers lived in the realm of sight, in contrast to the faith mentioned in v. 12. They liked to have curious visions. Such insistence on visual experience resulted in fleshly pride, the vain puffing up by the mind set on the flesh. ",
  "6297":"Lit., the mind of his flesh. ",
  "6298":"The heresy of angel worship distracted the saints from holding Christ as the Head. God's economy is to head up all things in Christ (Eph. 1:10) through His Body, the church, making Christ the center of all things. The subtle one's device is to carry the saints away and thus cause the Body of Christ to collapse. ",
  "6299":"The phrase out from whom indicates that the Body of Christ grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head. ",
  "6300":"The heresy caused the saints to be severed from the Head, and thus it damaged the Body. The apostle's revelation uplifted Christ and caused the Body to be safeguarded and built up. ",
  "6301":"Joints are for the supply of the Body. ",
  "6302":"Sinews are for the knitting together of the members of the Body. ",
  "6303":"Growing is a matter of life, which is God Himself. As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God as the source of life. By holding Christ, the church grows with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life. ",
  "6304":"The growth of the Body of Christ has nothing to do with doctrinal knowledge of the Bible, the way of worship, or any such matter. Rather, the growth of the Body depends on the growth of God, the increase of God's element, in the Body. ",
  "6305":"Or, since. ",
  "6306":"In baptism (Rom. 6:3). ",
  "6307":"The elements of the world are the elementary principles of outward, material things, the childish teachings of externalism, such as asceticism. This is altogether different from God's way, the way of the cross. See note 8. ",
  "6308":"These are ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning material things and deal with, respectively, things that move, things that are edible, and things that are tangible. Handling, tasting, and touching include virtually every kind of action, and the ordinances concerning them are related to the practice of asceticism. ",
  "6309":"Or, become corrupted. All material things are destined to decompose and perish through corruption when used (1 Cor. 6:13; Matt. 15:17). ",
  "6310":"Or, consumed. ",
  "6311":"Such things refers to the commandments and teachings of men (v. 22) and ordinances (v. 20). ",
  "6312":"The Greek word denotes a word or a saying; hence, expression, show of reason, and, therefore, a reputation. ",
  "6313":"This is asceticism. ",
  "6314":"The ordinances, rules, and regulations of the elementary teachings of externalism and asceticism are of no value in restraining the indulgence of the flesh. ",
  "6315":"Verses 1-4 imply that with Christ we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory. ",
  "6316":"This is the raising aspect of baptism, which is altogether contrary to asceticism. We were raised together with Christ. We are now where Christ is, sitting in the heavens. Hence, in contrast to the ascetics, we should not practice the things on the earth. We should seek the things that are in the heavens, such as knowing Christ as everything to us, so that we take Him as life and thereby walk in Him. ",
  "6317":"I.e., in the heavens; in contrast to on the earth in v. 2. The heavens are linked to Christ and joined to the church. The things above include the ascended Christ and all things pertaining to Him. Therefore, to seek the things above is to seek to live Christ in and with the church. ",
  "6318":"The things on the earth include culture, religion, philosophy, and improvement in behavior, as spoken of in the preceding two chapters. ",
  "6319":"We died with Christ and so were set free from the things on the earth, especially things related to asceticism. We were baptized into His death (Rom. 6:3). ",
  "6320":"Because our life (not our natural life, but our spiritual life, which is Christ) is hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer be concerned for things on the earth. God in the heavens should be the sphere of our living. With Christ we should live in God. ",
  "6321":"That our life is hidden with Christ in God means that it is hidden with Christ in the heavens. ",
  "6322":"That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life in order to experience the universally extensive Christ revealed in this book, so that all He is and has attained and obtained will not remain objective but will become our subjective experience. ",
  "6323":"In God, Christ is our life. This life is now hidden but will be manifested. Then we will be manifested with this life in glory. <br><br>   In 2:20--3:4 the unique way and the unique person are revealed to us. The unique way is the cross, the center of God's government, and the unique person is Christ, the preeminent, all-inclusive One, the center of the universe. By the cross, not by asceticism, we were saved from the negative things. By Christ, not by philosophy, we live the life hidden in God. <br><br>   Christ, who is our life, is the allotted portion of the saints (1:12), the image of the invisible God (1:15), the Firstborn of all creation (1:15), the Firstborn from the dead (1:18), the One in whom God's fullness dwells (1:19; 2:9), the mystery of God's economy (1:26), the mystery of God (2:2), the reality of all positive things (2:16-17), and the constituent of the new man (vv. 10-11). By taking such an all-inclusive Christ as life and thus living Him, we experience and enjoy all His riches. ",
  "6324":"This is based on the fact that we have been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20a) and baptized into His death (Rom. 6:3). We execute Christ's death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit (Rom. 8:13). This corresponds with Gal. 5:24. Christ accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion. Now we apply it to our lustful flesh. This is absolutely different from asceticism. ",
  "6325":"In our sinful members is the law of sin, making us captives of sin and causing our corrupted body to become the body of death (Rom. 7:23-24). Hence, our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness. ",
  "6326":"Putting off the old man is like putting off an old garment. First, we put to death the physical lusts, then we put away the psychological evils, and last, we put off the entire old man with his practices. This is not by our own energy but by the power of the all-inclusive Spirit. ",
  "6327":"See note 22 in Eph. 4. ",
  "6328":"Putting on the new man is like putting on a new garment. ",
  "6329":"The Greek word here means new in relation to time, whereas the word in Eph. 4:24 means new in nature, quality, or form. Concerning the new man, see note 24 par. 1, in Eph. 4. Since Christ is the constituent of the new man, we, who are the new man, are one with Christ. This is the most basic and crucial point in this book. ",
  "6330":"Because the new man was created with us, who belong to the old creation (Eph. 2:15), as his constituents, he needs to be renewed. This renewing takes place mainly in our mind, as indicated by the phrase unto full knowledge. The new man was created in our spirit and is being renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the image of Christ. ",
  "6331":"Referring to the image of Christ as the very expression of God (1:15; Heb. 1:3a). ",
  "6332":"Referring to Christ the Creator, who created the new man in Himself (Eph. 2:15). ",
  "6333":"Where, referring to the new man in v. 10, means in the new man. ",
  "6334":"Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility and no room for any natural person to exist. ",
  "6335":"The Greeks favored philosophical wisdom; the Jews, miraculous signs (1 Cor. 1:22). ",
  "6336":"Circumcision here refers to those who observed the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision, to those who did not care for the Jewish religion. ",
  "6337":"A barbarian is an uncultured person. ",
  "6338":"Scythians were considered the most barbarous. ",
  "6339":"One who has been sold into slavery. ",
  "6340":"One who has been freed from slavery. ",
  "6341":"In the new man there is room only for Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). In the new man He is the centrality and universality. He is the constituent of the new man, and He is all in all in the new man. ",
  "6342":"All refers to all the members who constitute the new man. ",
  "6343":"Put on here is in the sense of putting on a garment. ",
  "6344":"To be holy means to be not common or worldly but separated unto God. See note 2 in ch. 1. ",
  "6345":"Lit., yourselves. ",
  "6346":"The forgiving Lord is our life and lives within us; forgiving is a virtue of His life. When we take Him as our life and person and live by Him, our forgiving of others will be spontaneous &#151; it will become a virtue of our Christian life. ",
  "6347":"God is love (1 John 4:16). Love is the very essence of God's being, the very substance of the divine life. Hence, to put on love is to clothe ourselves with the element of God's life. Such a love is the uniting bond in the combination of perfectness, completeness, and mature virtues. We need to put on not only the new man (v. 10) but also the virtues of the new man (v. 12), and to put on love over all the virtues (v. 14). ",
  "6348":"Or, completeness. ",
  "6349":"The peace of Christ is Christ Himself. By this peace Christ has made the two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, one new man, and this peace has become a part of the gospel (Eph. 2:14-18). We should let this peace arbitrate in our hearts for the Body life. ",
  "6350":"Or, umpire, preside, be enthroned as a ruler and decider of everything. The arbitrating peace of Christ in our hearts dissolves the complaint mentioned in v. 13. ",
  "6351":"Which refers to the peace of Christ. We were called to this peace in the one Body of Christ. For the proper Body life we need the peace of Christ to arbitrate, to adjust, and to decide all things in our heart in our relationship with the members of His Body. ",
  "6352":"That we were called to the peace of Christ should also be a motive for our letting this peace arbitrate in our hearts. ",
  "6353":"We not only should let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, but we also should be thankful to the Lord. In the Body life our heart should always be in a peaceful condition toward the members and should be thankful to the Lord. ",
  "6354":"The word spoken by Christ. In His New Testament economy God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only by Himself in the Gospels but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation. All these speakings can be considered His word. <br><br>   In this passage the infilling of spiritual life that overflows in praising and singing is related to the word, whereas in the parallel passage, Eph. 5:18-20, the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit. This indicates that the word is the Spirit (John 6:63b). A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the word, that the Spirit may bubble over with praise and lauding melodies from within the believers. <br><br>   This book is focused on Christ as our Head and life. The way for Him to exercise His Headship and minister His riches to us is through His word. Hence, the emphasis is on the word of Christ. Ephesians is concerned with the church as the Body of Christ. The way for us to live a normal church life is to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God. Hence, the Spirit is emphasized. In Ephesians both the Holy Spirit and our spirit are emphasized again and again; the word is even considered to be the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). However, in this book each of the two spirits is mentioned only once (1:8; 2:5). In Ephesians the word is for washing away our natural life (Eph. 5:26) and fighting against the enemy (Eph. 6:17), whereas in this book the word is for revealing Christ (1:25-27) in His preeminence, centrality, and universality. ",
  "6355":"Lit., to be in a house, to indwell, to inhabit. The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being. ",
  "6356":"The riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) are in His word. Such a rich word must inhabit us richly. ",
  "6357":"The phrase in all wisdom may also be placed so as to modify teaching and admonishing. ",
  "6358":"Teaching and admonishing and singing modify the verb dwell. This indicates that the way to let the Lord's word dwell in us richly is by teaching, admonishing, and singing. ",
  "6359":"Lit., yourselves. ",
  "6360":"We should teach and admonish not only with words but also with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. ",
  "6361":"See notes 14 and 17 in John 1. ",
  "6362":"The name denotes the person. The Lord's person is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17a). To do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit. This is to live Christ. ",
  "6363":"The section from this verse through 4:1 is a sister passage to Eph. 5:22--6:9, regarding the believers' ethical relationships. In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of having spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body of Christ in the normal church life. In Colossians the emphasis is on our holding Christ as our Head and taking Him as our life by having His rich word dwell in us, that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression. <br><br>   For each point in this passage, see the appropriate note in Ephesians. ",
  "6364":"This point is not made as clear in Eph. 6:8 as it is here. The inheritance here is what the believers will inherit (Rom. 8:17; Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 1:4). The inheritance as recompense indicates that the Lord uses the inheritance that He will give to His believers as an incentive for them to be faithful in their service to Him. The unfaithful ones will surely miss this recompense (Matt. 24:45-51; 25:20-29). ",
  "6365":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "6366":"I.e., continue persistently, steadfastly, and earnestly. ",
  "6367":"Prayer preserves the grace that we received in chs. 1--3. ",
  "6368":"In prayer we need to be watchful and alert, not negligent. Such watchfulness should be accompanied by thanksgiving. A lack of thanksgiving is an indication of prayerlessness. The prayer life is kept by watching with thanksgiving. ",
  "6369":"This implies that we need to keep ourselves open to the word of God. ",
  "6370":"See note 16 in Eph. 5. ",
  "6371":"See note 29 in Eph. 4. Every word proceeding out of our mouth must be with Christ and must be the uttering of Christ, who is grace. ",
  "6372":"Salt makes food agreeable and pleasant to the taste. Speech seasoned with salt keeps us at peace with one another (Mark 9:50). ",
  "6373":"In vv. 7-17 the apostle's fellowship shows us that the new man as practiced at the apostle's time was an issue of the apostle's work, which encouraged the believers to seek after Christ, the very constituent of the new man, as their enjoyment. By means of the traffic among the churches, we experience in a practical way the living of the new man. Such a living has Christ as its reality. ",
  "6374":"In the Greek, stand here is in the passive voice. Hence, it implies being placed, being presented, and corresponds with present in 1:28. ",
  "6375":"Or, complete. ",
  "6376":"See note 9 in ch. 1. ",
  "6377":"The church in the house of Nymphas was the local church in Laodicea, which met in Nymphas's house. Such meetings in the saints' homes afford every attending believer the opportunity to function, and they also strengthen the mutual fellowship among the saints. ",
  "6378":"Some MSS read, her; others, their. ",
  "6379":"This Epistle and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city. Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all that He is and has done. Hence, it is of men (such as the Thessalonians), yet is in God and in the Lord organically. This organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life. Such a living is the theme of the two Epistles. ",
  "6380":"Thessalonica was a city of the Roman Empire, in the province of Macedonia, which was north of the province of Achaia. It was the next city the apostle Paul and his co-worker Silvanus visited after Philippi, after the Macedonian call he received on his second ministry journey (Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4). The apostle stayed and worked in Thessalonica for only a short time, probably less than one month (Acts 17:2). ",
  "6381":"In this chapter the Triune God is revealed in His triune work upon us &#151; the Father selected us (vv. 1, 3-4), the Son delivers us (v. 10), and the Holy Spirit propagates, imparts, and transmits the Triune God into us (vv. 5-6). Such a triune work is for our enjoyment of His salvation. ",
  "6382":"The Greek word denotes acts, actions, activities. ",
  "6383":"Here faith indicates the nature and strength of the work; love, the motivation for and characteristic of labor; and hope, the source of endurance. These depict the structure of the genuine Christian life, a life constructed with faith, love, and hope (see note 13 in 1 Cor. 13). Such a life originates not from the ability of the believers' natural being but from the infusion of what God, in whom they believe, is. It is carried out by their sacrificial love toward their loving Lord, who loved them and gave Himself for them, and toward His members, whom He has redeemed through His death in love. This life lasts and stands unchanging by the sustaining power of the hope in which the believers look for their beloved Lord, who promised that He would come to take them to Himself. Such a life is the content of this Epistle. <br><br>   How marvelous that the Thessalonian believers could live such a life through the apostle's short ministry of less than one month! This encourages us to preach the complete gospel to typical unbelievers in full assurance of faith, and to minister the deeper truths concerning the Christian life to new converts. <br><br>   In the two Epistles to the young church in Thessalonica, the genuine Christian life for the proper church life is revealed in a simple and brief way. It is a life of three dimensions in the light of the Lord's coming back, having faith as the beginning, the foundation, love as the process, the construction, and hope as the consummation, the completion. Faith is toward God (v. 8), love is toward the saints (3:12; 4:9-10), and hope is in the Lord's coming (2:19). The first Epistle is for encouragement and comfort; the second is for correction and balance. The believers should live, walk, and work by faith and love in the hope of the Lord's coming back; but they should not have the erroneous concept that the Lord will come immediately and, thus, that they need not make any long-range plans. The apostle Paul's writings concerning the Christian life for the church life begin with the book of Romans and conclude with these two Epistles. ",
  "6384":"Or, toil, endeavoring, striving, working. ",
  "6385":"I.e., endurance issuing from hoping in our Lord Jesus Christ. ",
  "6386":"God's choosing before the foundation of the world for His eternal purpose (Eph. 1:4). The apostles knew that the brothers, beloved of God, were chosen by God in such a manner for the fulfillment of His heart's desire. ",
  "6387":"The apostles not only preached the gospel; they lived it. Their ministering of the gospel was not only by word but also by a life that displayed the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of their faith. They were the pattern of the glad tidings that they spread. ",
  "6388":"Since the preachers were the pattern of the gospel, the believers became imitators of them. This, then, led the believers to follow the Lord, to take Him as their pattern (Matt. 11:29). ",
  "6389":"The word preached by Paul was the embodiment of the Triune God, conveying and transmitting Him &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit &#151; into the believers in Christ. This word as the divine gospel was received by the Thessalonians, who were typical Gentile unbelievers. ",
  "6390":"The imitators of the apostles (v. 6) became a pattern to all other believers. ",
  "6391":"This means that the believers' faith toward God sounded out together with the word of the Lord. Not only the Lord's objective word but also the believers' subjective faith went out. ",
  "6392":"Implying a receptive welcome. ",
  "6393":"To turn to God from the idols, to serve a living and true God, and to await His Son from the heavens are the three basic substances of the Christian life as viewed from another angle. To turn to God from the idols is to turn away not only from the false gods, together with the devil and the demons behind them, but also from all things other than God. This is accomplished by faith infused into the new converts through their hearing of the word of the gospel. To serve a living and true God is to serve the very God who is triune &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; who has been processed to be the believers' life and life supply for their enjoyment. They should experience Him not only as the object of worship but also as the all-inclusive Supplier who lives in them. This experience is brought about by love produced within the believers by the sweet taste of the rich supply of the Father, through the Son, and in the Spirit. To await the Son of God from the heavens is to look for the One who passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens, and who will come back to receive His believers into glory. This is the hope that strengthens the believers to stand steadfastly in their faith. ",
  "6394":"Lit., serve as a slave. ",
  "6395":"The living and true God is in contrast to the dead and false idols. God must be living and true to us and in us in our daily life, so that our present living will testify that the God whom we serve is living and true. ",
  "6396":"Because we are awaiting the Son of God from the heavens, our future is focused on Him. Our life declares that we have no hope on this earth and no positive destiny in this age, and that our hope is the coming Lord, who is our destiny forever. This governs, holds, and keeps our Christian life for the church life. ",
  "6397":"The wrath of the coming judgment of God (Rom. 2:5-6, 8-9). ",
  "6398":"The apostle stressed repeatedly their entrance toward the believers (1:5, 9). This shows that their manner of life played a great role in infusing the gospel into the new converts. It was not only what they said but what they were. ",
  "6399":"See note 1 in Phil. 1. ",
  "6400":"This was the apostles' experience of God in enjoying Him as their boldness in the struggle for the gospel. ",
  "6401":"Deception refers to the goal, uncleanness to the motive, and guile to the means. All three are of and by the subtle and deceiving devil. ",
  "6402":"God's entrusting depends on His approval, which comes out of His testing. The apostles were first tested and approved by God and then were entrusted by Him with the gospel. Hence, their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men but of God to please Him. He proved, examined, and tested their hearts continually (Psa. 26:2; 139:23-24). ",
  "6403":"Or, pretense, cloak. To have any pretext for covetousness is to peddle or adulterate the word of God (2 Cor. 2:17; 4:2). It is also to pretend to be godly for the sake of gain (1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11; 2 Pet. 2:3). ",
  "6404":"To seek glory from men is a real temptation to every Christian worker. Many have been devoured and spoiled by this matter. ",
  "6405":"Or, asserted authority. Lit., been able to be in weight; i.e., been burdensome (cf. v. 9; 1 Cor. 9:4-12). To assert authority, dignity, or right in Christian work damages that work. The Lord Jesus, while on earth, gave up His dignity (John 13:4-5), and the apostle preferred not to use his right (1 Cor. 9:12). ",
  "6406":"In some instances the Greek word means a mother; hence, a nursing mother (cf. Gal. 4:19). ",
  "6407":"Cherishing, which includes nourishing, indicates care that is more tender than mere nourishing. See note 29 in Eph. 5. ",
  "6408":"Being affectionately fond of, affectionately desirous of, like a nursing mother affectionately interested in her child, whom she nourishes and cherishes. This was what the apostles did with new believers. See note 17. ",
  "6409":"To live a clean and upright life, as portrayed in vv. 3-6 and 10, and to love the new converts, even by giving our own souls to them, as described in vv. 7-9 and 11, are the prerequisites for infusing them with the salvation conveyed in the gospel that we preach. ",
  "6410":"See note 75 in Luke 1. Holy refers to conduct toward God, righteous to conduct toward men, and blameless to conduct toward all &#151; God, men, and Satan. ",
  "6411":"The apostle was strong in stressing what or how they were (1:5), because what they were opened the way to bring their new converts into God's full salvation. ",
  "6412":"In cherishing the believers as their own children, the apostles considered themselves a nursing mother; in exhorting the believers, a father. ",
  "6413":"Or, entreating. ",
  "6414":"God's calling is according to His selection and follows His selection (1:4). ",
  "6415":"As worshippers of idols (1:9), the believers were in the kingdom of Satan (Matt. 12:26). Now, through the salvation in Christ they were called, and they have believed into the kingdom of God, which is the sphere in which they can worship and enjoy God under the divine ruling with the view of entering into God's glory. ",
  "6416":"God's glory goes with His kingdom. See note 13 in Matt. 6. ",
  "6417":"Lit., the word of hearing of God from us. ",
  "6418":"The word received by the believers was from the apostles, but it was of God. Its source, its origin, was God and not the apostles. ",
  "6419":"Since the word of God is living and operative (Heb. 4:12), it operates in the believing ones. ",
  "6420":"The apostle taught the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16), indicating that all the churches should bear the same testimony of Jesus. Hence, the churches are all lampstands of the same kind (Rev. 1:9, 20). ",
  "6421":"Lit., to the end; hence, to the uttermost. ",
  "6422":"This word implies that the apostles considered the new converts precious and dear to them. Paul likened their departure from them to a bereavement, a loss that they suffered through missing them. ",
  "6423":"Lit., the season of an hour. ",
  "6424":"This is the apostles' yearning over the new converts (v. 8). ",
  "6425":"Because the apostles were carrying out the will of God, Satan frustrated them. ",
  "6426":"Gk. parousia, meaning presence, as in 3:13 and 4:15. The Lord's coming is His presence. In this light these two early Epistles were written. Every chapter of the first Epistle ends with the Lord's coming back. ",
  "6427":"Since the apostles were the believers' nursing mother and exhorting father (vv. 7, 11), the believers, as the apostles' children, were their glory and joy. ",
  "6428":"The chief city of the province of Achaia of the Roman Empire, where the apostle Paul preached the gospel to the philosophical Greeks (Acts 17:15-34). ",
  "6429":"Some MSS read, minister of God. A minister of God is God's fellow worker (1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1). What a privilege! What a blessing! ",
  "6430":"Or, exhort, comfort. ",
  "6431":"If we are established in the faith (v. 2), afflictions will work out for our good (Rom. 8:28) according to God's purpose in His appointment. Otherwise, we may be shaken by the tempter (v. 5) through the afflictions. ",
  "6432":"Or, destined, set, located. God has destined, appointed, that we should pass through afflictions. Hence, afflictions are God's allotted portion to us, and He has set us, located us, in a situation of afflictions. ",
  "6433":"Imperfect tense, indicating repeated action. ",
  "6434":"The subtle devil, the old serpent, who tempted Eve (Gen. 3:1-6; 1 Tim. 2:14). ",
  "6435":"The aim of the subtle tempter is to destroy the gospel work accomplished through God's fellow workers, so that it would be in vain. ",
  "6436":"The apostle was in Corinth after leaving Athens (Acts 17:15-16; 18:1, 5). It was in Corinth that he wrote this lovely letter to the dear saints in Thessalonica for their encouragement. ",
  "6437":"The sound condition of the believers is always a comfort to God's fellow workers, who work on them and bear them as a burden. ",
  "6438":"Or, distress. See notes 26 in 1 Cor. 7 and 10 in 2 Cor. 12. ",
  "6439":"The believers' standing firm in the Lord ministers life to the apostles. ",
  "6440":"Standing firm in the Lord is in contrast to being shaken from the faith (v. 3). ",
  "6441":"Or, perfect. The verb form of the Greek word in 2 Cor. 13:9 (see note 2 there). The believers in Thessalonica, being young in the Lord, were still lacking in their new faith. The apostle realized this with much loving concern for them. This was his reason for writing this Epistle. ",
  "6442":"In Greek, make straight here is singular. This indicates that the apostle considered that God the Father and the Lord Jesus are one. How good to have our way in the ministry made straight by such a One! And how beautiful are the footsteps of the apostles in their carrying out of this One's ministry for the fulfilling of His purpose! ",
  "6443":"The apostle's concern for the young believers was first in regard to their faith (vv. 2-10) and then in regard to their love, which issues from faith and works together with faith (Gal. 5:6; 1 Tim. 1:14 and note 2). Such love is an indication of growth in life (1:3). ",
  "6444":"The establishing of the believers' hearts blameless issues from faith and love, as mentioned in the preceding verses. This spontaneously produces the hope of the coming back of our dear Lord, in whom we believe and whom we love. Hence, again we see that faith, love, and hope are the implied factors in the construction of this Epistle. ",
  "6445":"Inwardly, our heart must be established in holiness; outwardly, our body must be preserved in sanctification (4:4; 5:23). This is so that we may have a holy life, and this holy life is for the church life. ",
  "6446":"See note 2 in Rom. 1. ",
  "6447":"See note 19 in ch. 2. ",
  "6448":"Believers in Christ (see notes 2 in Rom. 1 and 2 in 1 Cor. 1), including the Old Testament saints (Dan. 7:18, 21-22, 25, 27; Zech. 14:5). ",
  "6449":"Some MSS add, Amen. ",
  "6450":"See note 19 in Rom. 6. God's will is that His redeemed people, the believers in Christ, live a life of holiness according to His holy nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him. For this He is sanctifying us wholly (5:23). ",
  "6451":"At Paul's time, in both Corinth and Thessalonica sensuality and immorality were rife in the pagan religions and even were fostered by pagan worship. Man was made to express God (Gen. 1:26). Concerning this purpose, nothing ruins man more than fornication. This prevents man from being holy, separated unto God, and contaminates man to the uttermost in fulfilling God's holy purpose. Hence, the apostle strongly charged the newly converted Gentile believers to be sanctified unto God, to abstain from fornication, the most gross sin in the eyes of God, that they might avoid its damage and contamination. ",
  "6452":"Implying to keep, to preserve. ",
  "6453":"Concerning the interpretation of vessel here, there are two schools: one holds that the vessel is man's body, as in 2 Cor. 4:7; the other, that it is a man's wife, as in 1 Pet. 3:7. The context of this verse and the next verse, which include phrases such as each one of you, in sanctification and honor, and especially not in the passion of lust, justifies the interpretation of the first school but not that of the second. Here the apostle considered man's body his vessel, just as David did in 1 Sam. 21:5. In the same matter concerning the use of the body, both Paul and David considered man's body his vessel. To keep, or preserve, man's vessel in sanctification and honor, not allowing it to indulge in the passion of lust, is the safeguard against committing fornication. ",
  "6454":"Sanctification refers more to a holy condition before God; honor, to a respectable standing before man. Man was created for God's purpose with a high standing, and marriage was ordained by God for the propagation of man to fulfill God's purpose. Hence, marriage should be held in honor (Heb. 13:4). To abstain from fornication is not only to remain in a sanctified condition before God but also to hold and keep a standing of honor before man. ",
  "6455":"That they do not know God is the basic reason that people indulge in the passion of lust. ",
  "6456":"I.e., overpass (limits), overreach, transgress, go beyond. Overstep and take advantage of his brother refers to the committing of adultery with a brother's wife. ",
  "6457":"Or, make a gain of; hence, defraud. ",
  "6458":"The matter of fornication, mentioned in v. 3. ",
  "6459":"The Lord judges fornicators and adulterers as an avenger, as a punisher, meting out justice. ",
  "6460":"Things such as overstepping and taking advantage of others. ",
  "6461":"Lit., based on. ",
  "6462":"The uncleanness of things such as fornication and adultery. Some teach that uncleanness here refers to unfair gain in business, and that v. 6 speaks of taking advantage of a brother in doing business. However, such a teaching is not acceptable in light of the context of this section, which begins at v. 3 with the charge to abstain from fornication. Actually, v. 7 is the concluding word of this charge. ",
  "6463":"I.e., in the element of sanctification, in the sphere of God's holy nature. ",
  "6464":"The apostle's charge to abstain from fornication is based on sanctification (v. 3), strengthened by sanctification (v. 4), and concluded here with sanctification, because fornication, the most unclean thing, destroys the holy standing and character of God's called saints. ",
  "6465":"This verse is the conclusion of the section that begins with v. 3. ",
  "6466":"I.e., rejects the charge in the preceding verses. ",
  "6467":"The Holy Spirit given to us by God is the Holy One who sanctifies us, making us holy before God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11). The will (v. 3), the call (v. 7), and the Spirit of God are all for our sanctification. First, God had His will, then He called us, and then He gave us His Holy Spirit. By His Spirit we can be sanctified to answer His call and fulfill His will. ",
  "6468":"Gk. philadelphia, composed of phileo, to love (referring to love in general, as to have affection for ), and adelphos, brother. ",
  "6469":"Gk. agapao, referring to noble love. ",
  "6470":"I.e., dead (v. 16; John 11:11-14; 1 Cor. 11:30). For believers to die was considered by both the Lord and the apostle as going to sleep. ",
  "6471":"Gk. parousia, meaning presence. See note 3 in Matt. 24. ",
  "6472":"A signal for assembling. ",
  "6473":"The last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52), a trumpet for assembling God's redeemed people (cf. Num. 10:2). ",
  "6474":"I.e., snatched up speedily and in a way that cannot be resisted. It is the same Greek word as in Acts 8:39 and 2 Cor. 12:2, 4. The mentioning here of the rapture of the believers at the Lord's coming is in a general way, as a word of comfort. Details concerning this matter are revealed in other books of the New Testament, such as Matthew and Revelation. ",
  "6475":"In Rev. 12 the man-child, i.e., the overcomers, is caught up, raptured, to the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of the present age (Rev. 12:5-6, 14). Here, the majority of the believers, including those who are resurrected from the dead and those who are living at that time, are raptured to the air at the end of the great tribulation, at the time of the Lord's coming (parousia). ",
  "6476":"These are the times and the seasons with regard to the Lord's coming. This is confirmed by the day of the Lord in v. 2. ",
  "6477":"This indicates that the day of the Lord's coming is kept secret and will come suddenly, being known beforehand by no one (Matt. 24:42-43; Rev. 3:3; 16:15). ",
  "6478":"In the preceding chapter the coming of the Lord is mainly for comfort and encouragement. In this chapter the day of the Lord is mainly for warning (vv. 3-6), since it is mentioned in the Word mainly in relation to the Lord's judgment (1 Cor. 1:8; 3:13; 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; 2 Tim. 4:8). ",
  "6479":"This is the result of men's intense rebellion against God under Satan's instigation near the time of the Lord's coming (v. 2). ",
  "6480":"I.e., be unwatchful. So in the next verse. ",
  "6481":"Watch is in contrast to sleep in the next verse; sober, in contrast to drunk. ",
  "6482":"In a stupor. ",
  "6483":"The breastplate and the helmet here point to spiritual warfare. The breastplate, which covers and protects our heart and spirit according to God's righteousness (Eph. 6:14), is of faith and love; the helmet, which covers and protects our mentality, our mind, is the hope of salvation (Eph. 6:17). Faith, love, and hope are the three basic constructing elements of the genuine Christian life, as depicted in 1:3. Faith is related to our will, a part of our heart (Rom. 10:9), and to our conscience, a part of our spirit (1 Tim. 1:19); love is related to our emotion, another part of our heart (Matt. 22:37); and hope is related to our understanding, the function of our mind. All these need to be protected so that a genuine Christian life can be maintained. Such a life is watchful and sober (vv. 6-7). At the beginning of the Epistle, the apostle praised the believers' work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope (1:3). Here, at the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorted them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them. ",
  "6484":"The hope of our Lord's coming back (1:3), which will be our salvation from both the coming destruction (v. 3) and the slavery of corruption of the old creation (Rom. 8:21-25). ",
  "6485":"Not salvation from eternal perdition through the Lord's death, but salvation from the coming destruction (v. 3) through the Lord's coming back. ",
  "6486":"Since God did not appoint us to wrath, we should watch, be sober, and fight (vv. 6, 8) to cooperate with God that we may obtain His salvation through the Lord Jesus. ",
  "6487":"See note 8. ",
  "6488":"The Lord died for us not only that we might be saved from eternal perdition but also that we may live together with Him through His resurrection. Such a living can save us from the coming destruction. ",
  "6489":"Or, are awake. I.e., are alive. ",
  "6490":"I.e., are dead (4:13-15). ",
  "6491":"On the one hand, the Lord is away from us and we are awaiting His coming back; on the other hand, He is with us (Matt. 28:20) and we can live together with Him (Rom. 6:8). ",
  "6492":"Recognize and then render respect and regard for. ",
  "6493":"The apostle was probably referring here to the elders who labor in teaching and take the lead among the believers (1 Tim. 5:17). ",
  "6494":"To take the lead is not mainly to rule but to set an example in doing things first, that others may follow. The elders not only should labor in teaching but also should do things as an example. The example may become a ground for their admonishing. ",
  "6495":"\"To lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion\" (Vincent); hence, to think of, to consider, to estimate, to esteem, to regard. ",
  "6496":"To regard the leading ones and to be at peace with one another is the proper condition of a local church. ",
  "6497":"Referring, perhaps, mainly to those who are idle and are unwilling to work, being busybodies (2 Thes. 3:11), undisciplined, unruled, rebellious. ",
  "6498":"Lit., little-souled; i.e., narrow and feeble in the capacity of mind, will, and emotion. ",
  "6499":"Probably referring generally to the weak ones, who are weak either in their spirit or soul or body, or are weak in faith (Rom. 14:1; 15:1). ",
  "6500":"This implies that in a local church, besides those who are disorderly and need admonishing, those who are little-souled and need consoling, and those who are weak and need sustaining, all the members may be a problem in some way and need us to be long-suffering toward them. ",
  "6501":"This means that regardless of how others treat us, even if their treatment is evil, we should pursue what is good for them. ",
  "6502":"This is based on the conditions mentioned in vv. 14-15. ",
  "6503":"This is to have uninterrupted fellowship with God in our spirit. It requires perseverance (Rom. 12:12; Col. 4:2) with a strong spirit (Eph. 6:18). ",
  "6504":"Because all things work together for our good that we may be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:28-29). ",
  "6505":"This clause modifies the three preceding exhortations. God wants us to live a rejoicing, praying, and thanking life. Such a life is a glory to God and a shame to His enemy. ",
  "6506":"The Spirit causes our spirit to be burning (Rom. 12:11) and our gifts to be flaming (2 Tim. 1:6). Hence, we should not quench Him. ",
  "6507":"Count as nothing, lightly esteem. ",
  "6508":"I.e., prophesying, the prophetic speech that issues from a revelation. It does not need to be a prediction (see 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-4 and notes there). ",
  "6509":"Including to discern prophecies (1 Cor. 14:29), to discern the spirits (1 Cor. 12:10), to test the spirits (1 John 4:1), to prove what is the will of God (Rom. 12:2), and to prove what is well pleasing to the Lord (Eph. 5:10). ",
  "6510":"The Greek word means species. It denotes anything in view, anything in perception; hence, a sight. It refers not to the appearance of evil but to the kind, the form, the shape, the sight, of evil. The believers, who live a holy life in faith, love, and hope, should abstain from evil of any kind. ",
  "6511":"And conjoins the blessing of God's sanctifying of our entire being, given in this verse, and the charge to abstain from every kind of evil, given in the preceding verse. On the one hand, we abstain from every kind of evil; on the other hand, God sanctifies us wholly. We cooperate with God that we may have a holy living. ",
  "6512":"The God of peace is the Sanctifier; His sanctification brings in peace. When we are wholly sanctified by Him from within, we have peace with Him and with man in every way (v. 13). ",
  "6513":"To set apart, separate unto God, from things common or profane. See notes 2 in Rom. 1 and 19 in Rom. 6. ",
  "6514":"Or, entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation. God sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, of either our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane. ",
  "6515":"This word strongly indicates that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. The spirit as our inmost part is the inner organ, possessing God-consciousness, that we may contact God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9). The soul is our very self (cf. Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25), a medium between our spirit and our body, possessing self-consciousness, that we may have our personality. The body as our external part is the outer organ, possessing world-consciousness, that we may contact the material world. The body contains the soul, and the soul is the vessel that contains the spirit. In the spirit, God as the Spirit dwells; in the soul, our self dwells; and in the body, the physical senses dwell. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration (John 3:5-6); second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18); and last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul (Rom. 8:11, 13) and transfiguring our body by His life power (Phil. 3:21). See notes 12 and 12 in Heb. 4. ",
  "6516":"God not only sanctifies us wholly but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete. Wholly is quantitative; complete is qualitative. Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete, i.e., He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect. Through the fall our body was ruined, our soul was contaminated, and our spirit was deadened. In God's full salvation our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect. For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (Heb. 9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (4:4; Rom. 6:6). Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia. ",
  "6517":"Or, in the presence (parousia). ",
  "6518":"Every chapter of this book ends with the coming of the Lord. This shows that the writer, Paul, lived and worked with the Lord's coming before him, taking it as an attraction, an incentive, a goal, and a warning. He not only did this himself but also encouraged the believers under his care to do the same. ",
  "6519":"The faithful God who called us will also sanctify us wholly and preserve our entire being complete. ",
  "6520":"Some MSS insert holy. This would mean that, since this Epistle is concerned with the holy life of the believers, the apostle in his concluding charge called the believers \"the holy brothers.\" ",
  "6521":"See notes 14 and 17 in John 1 and 10 in 1 Cor. 15. It is only when we enjoy the Lord as grace that we can live a holy life for the church life, a life that is genuine and proper for the church, lived by our having the Lord as the life supply. <br><br>   In this book the holy life for the church life is developed. To be sanctified is to be holy. In the universe, only God is holy; only He is distinct and different from all other things. He is not common and therefore is undefiled. Holiness is God's nature; it is an intrinsic characteristic of God's attributes. Therefore, to be holy completely and entirely, to be holy not only in outward position but also in inward disposition, we must have the holy nature that is characteristic of God. To have this divine nature of God, we must possess God, having Him as our life and nature. Only God can sanctify us wholly and can preserve our entire being, our spirit and soul and body, complete, keeping it from being common or defiled. God desires to sanctify us, and He Himself will do it, as long as we are willing to pursue Him as holiness (Heb. 12:14a) and cooperate with Him in this matter. In this way we can be holy as He is holy (1 Pet. 1:15-16). Without holiness we cannot see Him (Heb. 12:14b). <br><br>   God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12; 10:29) but also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature. By thus sanctifying us, He transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature. In this way He preserves our spirit, soul, and body wholly complete. His making us holy in position is outside of us, whereas His sanctifying us in disposition is within us, beginning from our spirit, the deepest part, passing through our soul, the intermediate part, and reaching to our body, the outer part. This work, which penetrates us deeply, is accomplished through the regeneration of our spirit (John 3:6), the transformation of our soul (Rom. 12:2), and the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30) by God's life-giving Spirit. Such a holy and sanctified life is necessary for us to have a church life that is pleasing to God and that expresses Him. ",

  "6523":"See note 1 in 1 Thes. 1. ",
  "6524":"See note 3 in 1 Thes. 1. In the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, faith and love were considered constructing elements of the believers' life for the church. Here, in this Epistle, faith and love are growing and increasing in the Thessalonians' Christian life. ",
  "6525":"The endurance issued from and was supported by the hope of the Lord's coming back (1 Thes. 1:3). Such endurance resulting from hope is always accompanied by faith. Hence, the phrase endurance and faith is used here. Both endurance and faith are needed in persecutions and afflictions. ",
  "6526":"God's judgment is righteous and just upon all men. It will be finalized in the future (Rom. 2:5-9; Rev. 20:11-15). The way God deals with different people in this age is an indication, a token, a proof, of the future execution of His righteous judgment. ",
  "6527":"The believers have been called into God's kingdom and glory (1 Thes. 2:12). To enter into this kingdom, we need to pass through afflictions (Acts 14:22). Hence, the persecutions and afflictions are a plain indication of God's righteous judgment, showing that we may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God. ",
  "6528":"Or, relief, ease, repose, liberty. In this age the believers suffer persecutions and troubles for the Lord. At the Lord's coming back they will be relieved of their sufferings and will enter into the Lord's rest and enjoy its liberty. ",

  "6531":"The Lord is the Lord of glory (1 Cor. 2:8); He was glorified in His resurrection and ascension (John 17:1; Luke 24:26; Heb. 2:9). Now He is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27) to bring us into glory (Heb. 2:10). At His coming back, on the one hand He will come from the heavens with glory (Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31), and on the other hand He will be glorified in His saints; that is, His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into His glory, conforming it to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Thus, the unbelievers will marvel at Him, admire Him, wonder at Him, in us, His believers. ",
  "6532":"Or, delight. The apostles prayed that God might fulfill the good intention, the delight, of the Thessalonians for goodness. ",
  "6533":"The grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord Himself within us as our life and life supply that we may live a life that will glorify the Lord and cause us to be glorified in Him. See notes 17 in John 1, 10 in 1 Cor. 15, and 14 in 2 Cor. 13. ",

  "6535":"Gk. parousia, meaning presence. See notes 19 in 1 Thes. 2 and 3 in Matt. 24. Two matters are covered here: the Lord's parousia (presence) and our gathering together (rapture) to Him. The Lord's parousia will begin with the rapture of the overcomers to the throne of God in heaven (Rev. 12:5-6); at the end of the great tribulation, which will occur in the last three and a half years of this age, the second half of the last week in Dan. 9:27 (Matt. 24:21 and note; Rev. 11:2 and note 4), it will come to the air (Rev. 10:1 and note 2) and last for a time; and it will end with its manifestation, \"the manifestation of His parousia\" (v. 8; Matt. 24:30 and note 4). During the time in which the Lord's parousia remains in the air, the majority of the believers will be raptured to meet the Lord there (1 Thes. 4:17). According to the context, the day of the Lord in v. 2 refers to the day of the Lord's parousia (coming), in which the rapture of the majority of the believers will occur. Verse 3 tells us affirmatively that before that day Antichrist will be revealed to play the major role in the great tribulation (v. 4; Rev. 13:1-8, 12-15). This reveals clearly and definitely that the Lord's coming (parousia) to the air and the rapture of the majority of the believers cannot take place before the great tribulation. ",

He will be the man of lawlessness and will change laws, destroy and corrupt many to an extraordinary degree, blaspheme God, and deceive men. Hence, the Lord will utterly destroy him, and he will become the son of perdition. ",
  "6543":"This fulfills the prophecy concerning Antichrist in Dan. 11:36-37. This will take place in the second half of the last week, as prophesied in Dan. 9:27. See note 15 in Matt. 24. ",
  "6544":"This is \"the holy place\" in Matt. 24:15, indicating that the temple of God will be rebuilt before the Lord comes back. ",

  "6556":"The believers have a good intention for goodness (1:11); the perishing ones (v. 10), who reject the truth of God, take pleasure in unrighteousness. To sin is a delight to them (Rom. 1:32). ",

By these three steps of the Spirit's sanctification, God's salvation is applied to us that we may obtain and enjoy it fully. The three steps of the Spirit's sanctification not only separate us from all old and negative things, making us holy unto God, but also sanctify us, making us a new creation full of the Lord's essence and element, that we may obtain the Lord's glory. ",

These are three aspects of one purpose, that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God, as symbolized by the golden lampstands in the ultimate portion of the divine revelation (Rev. 1:12, 20). For the accomplishing of this purpose, the following basic and crucial matters are stressed repeatedly in these three books: <br><br>   (1) The faith, the contents of the complete gospel according to God's New Testament economy. It is objective and is mentioned in 1 Tim. 1:4, 19; 2:7; 3:9, 13; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Tim. 3:8; 4:7; and Titus 1:1, 4, 13. <br><br>   (2) The truth, the reality of the contents of the faith, mentioned in 1 Tim. 2:4, 7; 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7, 8; 4:4; and Titus 1:1, 14. <br><br>   (3) Healthy teaching, in 1 Tim. 1:10, 2 Tim. 4:3, and Titus 1:9; 2:1; healthy words, in 1 Tim. 6:3 and 2 Tim. 1:13; healthy speech, in Titus 2:8; and healthy in the faith, in Titus 1:13; 2:2. All these are related to the condition of life. <br><br>   (4) Life, the eternal life of God, in 1 Tim. 1:16; 6:12, 19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; and Titus 1:2; 3:7. <br><br>   (5) Godliness, a living that is the expression of God, mentioned in 1 Tim. 2:2, 10 ( godly); 3:16; 4:7, 8; 5:4 (respect); 6:3, 5, 6, 11; 2 Tim. 3:5, 12 ( godly); and Titus 1:1; 2:12 ( godly). The opposite, ungodliness, is mentioned in 1 Tim. 1:9 (ungodly), 2 Tim. 2:16, and Titus 2:12. <br><br>   (6) Faith, our act of believing in the gospel, in God, and in His word and deeds. It is subjective and is mentioned in 1 Tim. 1:2, 5, 14, 19; 2:15; 4:12; 6:11; 2 Tim. 1:5, 13; 2:22; 3:10, 15; and Titus 2:2; 3:15. <br><br>   (7) The conscience, the leading part of our spirit, which justifies or condemns our relationships with God and with man. It is mentioned in 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Tim. 1:3; and Titus 1:15. <br><br>   The faith equals the contents of the economy, the household administration, the dispensation, of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God's economy. Healthy teaching, healthy words, and healthy speech are the ministry of the truth, ministering to people the reality of the divine truths. Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith. Godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective); such faith receives and participates in the divine realities. The conscience is a test and a check to preserve us in the faith. ",
  "6586":"It was according to the command of God and of Christ that Paul became an apostle. In his earlier Epistles he told us that he was an apostle through the will of God (1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:1). The command of God is a definite expression, a further direction, of the will of God. ",
  "6587":"God our Savior in 1 Tim. 1:1; 4:10 and Titus 2:13, and our Savior God in 1 Tim. 2:3 and Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4, are particular titles ascribed to God in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, which take God's salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God's New Testament economy (1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7). It was according to the command of such a saving God, a Savior God, not according to the command of the law-giving God, a demanding God, that Paul became an apostle. ",
  "6588":"Christ Jesus is not only God's Anointed (Christ) to be our Savior (Jesus) that we might be saved to gain the eternal life of God, but also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of this eternal life. The hope of eternal life revealed in Titus 1:2, which was the base and condition of Paul's apostleship, and the blessed hope revealed in Titus 2:13, which we are awaiting as the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, are intimately related to the person of God's Messiah, our Savior. Hence, He Himself is our hope, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). It was according to the command not only of our Savior God but also of the One who saved us with eternal life and will bring us into the glory of this life that Paul became an apostle. His command is of the eternal life and is to be fulfilled by the eternal life, in contrast to the command of the law-giving God, which was of letters and was to be fulfilled by human effort, without the supply of eternal life. ",
  "6589":"The Greek word is composed of honor and God. Thus, the name means to honor God. ",
  "6590":"Timothy became a genuine child of Paul not by natural birth but in faith (i.e., in the sphere and element of faith), not physically but spiritually. ",
  "6591":"This must have been after the apostle was liberated from his first imprisonment in Rome (see note 6 in 2 Tim. 4). He probably wrote this Epistle from Macedonia (today's northern Greece and southern Bulgaria). ",
  "6592":"Certain dissenting ones, such as those mentioned in v. 6 and Gal. 1:7; 2:12. ",
  "6593":"To teach different things was to teach myths, unending genealogies (v. 4), and the law (vv. 7-8). All such teaching was vain talking (v. 6), differing from the apostles' teaching, which was centered on Christ and the church, that is, on the economy of God. <br><br>   Paul's Epistles are the completion of the divine revelation concerning God's eternal purpose and economy (Col. 1:25). His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him. Concerning the church as the Body of Christ there are two sides: life and practice. From Romans through 2 Thessalonians a full revelation is given concerning the life of the church, including the nature, responsibility, and function of the church. Now, from 1 Timothy through Philemon a detailed revelation concerning the practice of the church is presented. This pertains to the administration and shepherding of a local church. For this, the first thing needed is to terminate the different teachings of the dissenters, which distract the saints from the central line and ultimate goal of God's New Testament economy (vv. 4-6). The different teachings in vv. 3-4, 6-7; 6:3-5, 20-21 and the heresies in 4:1-3 are the seed, the source, of the church's decline, degradation, and deterioration dealt with in 2 Timothy. ",
  "6594":"The same word is used in 4:7 and 2 Tim. 4:4. It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, true or false stories, and fictions. It might include Jewish stories of miracles, rabbinical fabrications, etc. These were profane and old-womanish myths (4:7) and Jewish myths (Titus 1:14). ",
  "6595":"Probably referring to Old Testament genealogies adorned with fables (Titus 3:9). ",
  "6596":"The Greek word means household law, implying distribution (the base of this word is of the same origin as that for pasture in John 10:9, implying a distribution of the pasture to the flock). It denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution); hence, it is also a household economy. God's economy in faith is His household economy, His household administration (cf. note 10 in Eph. 1; Eph. 3:9), which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church (3:15), the Body of Christ. The apostle's ministry was centered on this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God's enemy to distract His people from this economy. In the administration and shepherding of a local church, this divine economy must be made fully clear to the saints. <br><br>   In the first chapter of this book the apostle Paul presented God's economy in opposition to different teachings. God's economy is in faith (v. 4), whereas the different teachings are based on the principle of the law and centered on the law (vv. 7-10). Hence, faith is versus the law, as dealt with in Gal. 3 (vv. 2, 5, 23-25). Any teaching that is based on the principle of the law and centered on the law is unhealthy (v. 10). Only God's economy, which is in faith, in opposition to the teachings that are based on the principle of the law and centered on the law, is healthy and can make it possible for people to believe on Christ unto eternal life (v. 16) and to thus participate in God's eternal plan, God's economy, which is in faith. This is the gospel of glory with which the blessed God entrusted the apostle Paul (v. 11). If anyone thrusts away such faith and a good conscience, regarding the faith he becomes shipwrecked on a deep sea (v. 19). ",
  "6597":"The economy of God is a matter in faith, i.e., a matter that is initiated and developed in the sphere and element of the faith. God's economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, is not in the natural realm nor in the work of law but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God's plan (dispensation), which is carried out in faith, according to His New Testament economy. ",
  "6598":"Referring to the charge in v. 3. ",
  "6599":"The different teachings of the dissenting ones, mentioned in v. 3, caused envy and discord among the believers, which are contrary to love, the end of the apostle's charge. To carry out the apostle's charge, love, which is out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith, is needed. ",
  "6600":"A pure heart is a single heart without mixture, a heart that seeks only the Lord and takes the Lord as the unique goal. A good conscience is a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16). Unfeigned faith, related to the faith mentioned in v. 4, is faith without pretense or hypocrisy, faith that purifies the heart (Acts 15:9) and operates through love (Gal. 5:6). In the trend of the church's decline and in dealing with the different teachings, all these attributes are required for us to have a pure, true, and genuine love. ",
  "6601":"I.e., missed the mark, swerved, deviated. ",
  "6602":"Composed of myths and genealogies (v. 4) and the law (vv. 7-8). ",
  "6603":"Teachers of the law, who teach people what to do and what not to do, are different from ministers of Christ (4:6), who minister His riches to others. ",
  "6604":"Or, strongly affirm, emphatically affirm. The same word is used in Titus 3:8. See note 3 there. ",
  "6605":"Or, kill. ",
  "6606":"Healthy implies the matter of life. The sound teaching of the apostles, which is according to the gospel of the glory of God, ministers the healthy teaching as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them; in contrast, the different teachings of the dissenting ones (v. 3) sow the seeds of death and poison into others. Any teaching that distracts people from the center and goal of God's New Testament economy is not healthy. ",
  "6607":"The gospel of the glory of the blessed God is an excellent expression. It refers to God's economy, mentioned in v. 4. The gospel with which the apostle Paul was entrusted is the effulgence of the glory of the blessed God. By dispensing God's life and nature in Christ into God's chosen people, this gospel shines forth God's glory, in which God is blessed among His people. This is the commission and ministry the apostle received of the Lord (v. 12). This gospel should be commonly taught and preached in a local church. ",
  "6608":"The Lord not only appointed the apostle to the ministry and commissioned him with God's economy outwardly but also empowered him inwardly to carry out His ministry and fulfill His commission. This is altogether a matter of life in the Spirit. ",
  "6609":"A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man. Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee (Acts 22:3; Phil. 3:4-5), could never have blasphemed God. But he did speak evilly of the Lord Jesus. Here he confessed that this was blasphemy. This indicates that he believed in the deity of Christ. ",
  "6610":"Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way (Acts 22:4; Gal. 1:13, 23), just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus (Matt. 26:59, 67). ",
  "6611":"Saul, a blasphemer and a persecutor, first was shown mercy and then received grace (v. 14). Mercy reaches farther toward the unworthy one than grace does. Because Saul was one who blasphemed God and persecuted man, God's mercy reached him before the Lord's grace did. ",
  "6612":"To be ignorant is to be in darkness, and unbelief comes from blindness. Saul of Tarsus was in darkness and acted in blindness when he opposed God's New Testament economy. ",
  "6613":"The Lord's grace, coming after God's mercy, visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ. Faith and love are products of the Lord's grace. Mercy and grace come to us from the Lord; faith and love return to the Lord from us. This is a spiritual traffic between the Lord and us. ",
  "6614":"Through faith we receive the Lord (John 1:12), and through love we enjoy the Lord whom we have received (John 14:21, 23; 21:15-17). ",
  "6615":"Christ came into the world by incarnation to be our Savior (John 1:14). He was God incarnated to be a man that He might save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. In a local church this should be constantly announced as the glad tidings. ",
  "6616":"Saul of Tarsus, the foremost among sinners, became a pattern to sinners, showing that sinners can be visited by God's mercy and saved by the Lord's grace. ",
  "6617":"The uncreated life of God, the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ. ",
  "6618":"Paul's praise to God in this verse is related to the decline of the church. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible. He remains the same. He is the King of eternity. In spite of the church's decline, Paul had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel, is the King of the ages, incorruptible, unchangeable, and worthy of honor and glory. ",
  "6619":"See note 9 in Heb. 2. ",
  "6620":"To war the good warfare by the prophecies previously given. ",
  "6621":"It might be that some prophetic intimations were made concerning Timothy when he was admitted into the ministry (Acts 16:1-3). ",
  "6622":"To war the good warfare is to war against the different teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God's economy (v. 4) according to the apostle's ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life, that the blessed God may be glorified (vv. 11-16). ",
  "6623":"Faith and a good conscience (see note 5) go together. Whenever there is an offense in our conscience, there will be a leakage, and our faith will leak away. A good conscience accompanying faith is needed for warring the good warfare (v. 18) against the different teachings (v. 3) in a troubled local church. ",
  "6624":"This shows the seriousness of thrusting away faith and a good conscience. To hold faith and a good conscience is a safeguard for our Christian faith and life. The word shipwrecked implies that the Christian life and the church life are like a ship sailing on a stormy sea, needing to be safeguarded by faith and a good conscience. ",
  "6625":"The faith here is objective, referring to the things in which we believe (see note 23 in Gal. 1), whereas faith at the beginning of this verse is subjective, referring to the act of our believing. ",
  "6626":"A heretical teacher (2 Tim. 2:17). ",
  "6627":"An opposer and attacker of the apostle (2 Tim. 4:14-15). ",
  "6628":"I.e., punished. It may refer to the destruction of their physical body (cf. 1 Cor. 5:5). To deliver persons like Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan was to exercise the authority that the Lord had given to the apostle and the church (Matt. 16:19; 18:18) for the administrating of the church to counter Satan's evil plot. ",
  "6629":"A prayer ministry is the prerequisite for the administrating and shepherding of a local church. Concerning the difference between petitions and prayers, see note 6 in Phil. 4. ",
  "6630":"The Greek word denotes an approaching of God in a personal and confiding manner, i.e., an intervening, an interfering, before God in others' affairs for their benefit. ",
  "6631":"A quiet and tranquil life is one that is peaceable, still, and without disturbance, not only outwardly in circumstances but also inwardly in our heart and spirit. Such a life enables us to have an enjoyable church life in godliness and gravity. ",
  "6632":"Godlikeness, being like God, expressing God. The Christian life should be a life that expresses God and bears God's likeness in all things. ",
  "6633":"A quality of human character that is worthy of reverence; it implies dignity and inspires and invites honor (see note 8 in Phil. 4). Godliness is the expression of God; gravity is toward man. Our Christian life should express God toward man with an honorable character that invites man's reverence. ",
  "6634":"We should pray on behalf of all men (v. 1) because God our Savior desires all men to be saved and know the truth. Our prayer is required for the carrying out of God's desire. ",
  "6635":"God desires all the saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth. Truth means reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God's Word, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization, of these things. <br><br>   The object of the two Epistles to Timothy is to deal with the church's decline. In the first Epistle the decline crept in subtly through different teachings (1:3), and in the second it had developed openly and was worsening through heresies (2 Tim. 2:16-18). To deal with such a decline, the truth must be maintained. The first Epistle emphasizes that God desires all His saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth and that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15). The second Epistle stresses that the word of the truth should be rightly unfolded (2 Tim. 2:15) and that the ones who have deviated should return to the truth (2 Tim. 2:25). ",
  "6636":"Although God is triune &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; He is still the one God, not three Gods, contrary to what is mistakenly recognized and believed by many Christians. ",
  "6637":"A go-between. ",
  "6638":"The Lord Jesus was God from eternity (John 1:1). In time He became a man through incarnation (John 1:14). While He was living on earth as a man, He was also God (3:16). After His resurrection He is still man, as well as God (Acts 7:56; John 20:28). Hence, He is the only One qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men. ",
  "6639":"Christ gave Himself for the accomplishing of redemption for all men. This was necessary in order that He might be our Mediator. He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human person but also in His redemptive work. Both His person and His work are unique. ",
  "6640":"The Greek word means ransom paid in recompense. ",
  "6641":"The fact that Christ gave Himself a ransom for all men becomes the testimony to be borne in its own times. Whenever this fact is proclaimed, it is borne to men as a testimony in its own times. ",
  "6642":"A herald is a proclaimer of the gospel of Christ, an official reporter of God's New Testament economy; an apostle is one sent by God with a divine commission to set up churches for God, an ambassador from God to the world for the carrying out of His purpose; and a teacher is a tutor who teaches, defines, and explains the contents of God's eternal purpose and His New Testament economy. Paul had such a triple status and commission for the Gentiles. See note 11 in 2 Tim. 1. ",
  "6643":"I.e., one who teaches the Gentiles how to receive the faith and know the truth. ",
  "6644":"The faith here refers to the faith in Christ (3:13; Gal. 3:23-25), and truth refers to the reality of all the things in the economy of God revealed in the New Testament (see note 4). This corresponds with 4:3. It was in the sphere and element of this faith and truth, not in that of the law, types, and prophecies of the Old Testament, that Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher of the New Testament. ",
  "6645":"In a local church the leading ones must have a prayer life, as charged in vv. 1-2, to set an example of prayer for all the members to follow by praying always in every place. ",
  "6646":"See note 75 in Luke 1. ",
  "6647":"Hands symbolize our doings. Hence, holy hands signify a holy living, a living that is pious and that belongs to God. Such a holy life strengthens our prayer life. If our hands are not holy, our living is not holy and is not for God; we then have no supporting strength to pray, no holy hands to lift up in prayer. ",
  "6648":"Wrath and reasoning kill our prayer. Wrath is of our emotion, and reasoning is of our mind. To have a prayer life and pray unceasingly, our emotion and mind must be regulated to be in a normal condition, under the control of the Spirit in our spirit. ",
  "6649":"Disputatious reasoning. ",
  "6650":"Proper denotes fitting to the sisters' nature and position as saints of God. In Greek the word for clothing implies deportment, demeanor. A sister's demeanor, of which clothing is the main sign, must befit her saintly position. ",
  "6651":"Lit., shamefastness; i.e., bound or made fast by an honorable shame (Vincent), implying not forward or overbold but moderate, observing the proprieties of womanhood. ",
  "6652":"Sobermindedness, self-restraint; the restricting of oneself soberly and discreetly. The sisters in a local church should clothe themselves with these two virtues &#151; shamefastness and self-restraint &#151; as their demeanor. So also in v. 15. ",
  "6653":"The Greek word has the same base as the word for godliness. It denotes reverence toward God, a revering and honoring of God, as is fitting for one who worships God. ",
  "6654":"Silence. For sisters to learn in silence and to be in all subjection is for them to realize their position as women. This safeguards the sisters from the presumption of overstepping their position in the local church. ",
  "6655":"The Greek word denotes mainly submission. So also in 3:4. ",
  "6656":"To teach here means to teach with authority, to define and decide the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth. For a woman to teach in this way or to exercise authority over a man is to leave her position. In God's creation man was ordained to be the head, and woman to be in subjection to man (1 Cor. 11:3). In the church this ordination should be kept. ",
  "6657":"I.e., silence, abstention from speaking. ",
  "6658":"This brings us to the beginning. God always wants to bring us back to His beginning (Matt. 19:8). ",
  "6659":"Lit., molded; the verb means to mold (the dust) into a shape (Gen. 2:7). ",
  "6660":"Verse 13 gives the first reason that woman should subject herself to man. Here the second is presented. ",
  "6661":"Eve was deceived by the serpent (Gen. 3:1-6) because she did not remain in subjection under the headship of Adam but overstepped her position to contact the evil tempter directly without her head being covered. This is the strong ground for the apostle not to permit the sisters in a local church to teach with authority and to assert authority over men. Rather, the apostle directed them to learn in silence and to remain in all subjection. Man's headship is woman's protection. ",
  "6662":"Childbearing is a suffering. Suffering restricts and protects the fallen one from transgression. ",
  "6663":"Faith is for receiving the Lord (John 1:12), love is for enjoying Him (John 14:21, 23), and holiness is for expressing Him through sanctification. By faith we receive the Lord and thereby please God (Heb. 11:6); by love we enjoy the Lord and thereby keep His word (John 14:23); and by holiness we express the Lord and thereby see Him (Heb. 12:14). <br><br>   The first two chapters of this book give the practical instructions for having a proper local church: (1) terminate the distraction of different teachings (1:3-11); (2) emphasize God's economy, making it the central line and goal of the Christian life (1:4-6); (3) preach Christ to save sinners (1:12-17); (4) war a good warfare for God's New Testament economy by holding faith and a good conscience (1:18-19); (5) deal with the heretical teachers and the opposers of the apostle (1:20); (6) let the leading ones take the lead to have a prayer life, interceding for all men that Christ's redemption may be testified in due time (vv. 1-7); (7) let the brothers follow the pattern of prayer, praying at all times (v. 8); and (8) let the sisters adorn themselves in proper deportment and subject themselves to the brothers, remaining in quietness, faith, love, and holiness with sobriety (vv. 9-15). ",
  "6664":"Aspiration with a pure motive differs from ambition with an impure motive. ",
  "6665":"A Greek word composed of over and sight; hence, overseership, denoting the function of an overseer. ",
  "6666":"The Greek word is composed of over and seer; hence, overseer. An overseer in a local church is an elder (Acts 20:17, 28). The two titles refer to the same person, elder denoting a person of maturity, and overseer denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. Also, this teaching was the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God. ",
  "6667":"This does not denote being perfect in the eyes of God, but being in an irreproachable condition in the eyes of man. ",
  "6668":"This implies the restraining of the flesh, which is highly required of an elder. It keeps an elder in a simple and pure married life, free from the tangle of a complicated and confused marriage. ",
  "6669":"Self-controlled, moderate. ",
  "6670":"Not only keen but also discreet in the understanding of matters. ",
  "6671":"Decorous; meaning fitting the situation. ",
  "6672":"Hospitality requires love, care for people, and endurance. All these virtues are required for an elder to be qualified. ",
  "6673":"Teaching here is similar to parents' teaching of their children. An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of a local church. ",
  "6674":"This requires strong self-control. ",
  "6675":"This demands a strong restraining of the temper. ",
  "6676":"Yielding, approachable, mild, reasonable, and considerate in dealing with others, without strictness. ",
  "6677":"Not quarrelsome; peaceable. ",
  "6678":"Money is a test to all men. An elder must be pure in matters related to money, especially since the church fund is under the elders' management (Acts 11:30). ",
  "6679":"This is proof that one is qualified to take the oversight of a local church. ",
  "6680":"See note 2 in ch. 2; so also for grave in vv. 8 and 11. ",
  "6681":"Lit., newly planted one; denoting a person who has recently received the Lord's life but has not yet grown and developed in it. ",
  "6682":"Lit., beclouded with smoke. Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind, besotted with the self-conceit of pride. ",
  "6683":"The judgment suffered by Satan because he was proud of his high position (Ezek. 28:13-17). ",
  "6684":"A walk and living that issue from living out Christ and expressing Christ and are appreciated and praised by others. ",
  "6685":"An elder must be right with himself, with his family, with the church, and with those outside &#151; the society. And, according to the context, an elder must be right in intention, in motive, in character, in attitude, in word, and in deed. ",
  "6686":"Falling into the judgment suffered by the devil is due to the pride of the elder himself; falling into the snare of the devil is occasioned by the reproach from the outsiders. An elder should be alert not to be proud, on the one hand, and not to be reproachable, on the other, that he may avoid the devil's entanglement. ",
  "6687":"See note 10 in Rev. 2. ",
  "6688":"I.e., the serving ones. The overseers take care of the church; the deacons serve the church under the direction of the elders. These two are the only offices in a local church. ",
  "6689":"A serpent is double-tongued. A deacon in a local church, rendering service to all the saints, may easily be double-tongued in contacting the saints. In being such, he lives out the nature of the devil and brings death into the church life. ",
  "6690":"Being addicted to much wine is a sign of being unable to control oneself. A deacon in the local church service must exercise self-control in a full way. ",
  "6691":"A deacon should not seek gain from his rendering of service to the saints. To seek such gain is to be greedy for base gain (cf. 6:5b). ",
  "6692":"The faith here, as in 1:19 and 2 Tim. 4:7, is objective, referring to the things we believe in, the things that constitute the gospel. The mystery of the faith is mainly Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). A deacon in a local church should hold the mystery of the faith with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord's testimony. ",
  "6693":"A pure conscience is a conscience purified from any mixture. To hold the mystery of the faith for the Lord's testimony, a deacon needs such a purified conscience. ",
  "6694":"This may imply some apprenticeship. ",
  "6695":"I.e., serve; service is the function of a deacon. ",
  "6696":"Or, blameless. ",
  "6697":"Referring to deaconesses (Rom. 16:1). ",
  "6698":"Corresponding with not double-tongued in v. 8. The devil is a slanderer (Rev. 12:10). To slander is to live out the nature of the evil slanderer. A sister who is a deaconess, a serving one in a local church among many other sisters, should flee slander, the evil act of the devil. ",
  "6699":"See note 2. ",
  "6700":"Corresponding with not greedy for base gain in v. 8. A sister who is a deaconess needs to be faithful, trustworthy, in all things, especially in things concerning gain. ",
  "6701":"See note 2. ",
  "6702":"For a brother to manage his children and his own house well proves that he is capable of serving the church. ",
  "6703":"I.e., served. ",
  "6704":"Referring to a firm and steadfast standing as a believer and a saint before God and man. To serve the church well as a deacon strengthens one's Christian standing. ",
  "6705":"Or, much confidence. To serve the church well also strengthens the boldness, the confidence, of one's Christian faith. ",
  "6706":"This indicates that this book gives instructions concerning the way to take care of a local church. ",
  "6707":"Or, household; the same word as in vv. 4, 5, and 12 (houses). The household, the family, of God is the house of God. The house and the household are one thing &#151; the assembly that is composed of the believers (Eph. 2:19; Heb. 3:6). The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). We must live and act in our spirit so that in this house God can be manifested as the living God. ",
  "6708":"The living God, who lives in the church, must be subjective to the church rather than objective. The idol in the heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church too is living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh. ",
  "6709":"This is metaphoric speaking. The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. ",
  "6710":"The truth here refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God's New Testament economy. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities. A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church. ",
  "6711":"Or, by common acknowledgment, beyond reasoning, without controversy. ",
  "6712":"According to the context, godliness here refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, i.e., to God as life lived out in the church. This is the great mystery confessed universally by believers in Christ. ",
  "6713":"According to unconfirmed historical accounts, these six lines of poetry made up a song that the saints in the early church loved to sing. He refers to Christ, who was God manifested in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. The transition from the mystery of godliness to He implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living also is the manifestation of God in the flesh. ",
  "6714":"Through incarnation and human living (John 1:1, 14). In the flesh means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man (Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:7-8). Christ appeared to people in the form of man (2 Cor. 5:16), yet He was God manifested in man. ",
  "6715":"Or, vindicated. The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Rom. 1:3-4) but also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit (Matt. 3:15-16; 4:1). He was manifested in the flesh but was vindicated and justified in the Spirit. He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 14; Matt. 12:28) and offered Himself to God through the Spirit (Heb. 9:14). His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2) and His resurrection are both justifications in the Spirit. Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) to dwell and live in us (Rom. 8:9-10) for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. Hence, now we know Him and His members no longer according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). Since the manifestation of God in the flesh is justified in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), we must live and behave in our spirit that this justification may be accomplished. ",
  "6716":"Angels saw the incarnation, human living, and ascension of Christ (Luke 2:9-14; Matt. 4:11; Acts 1:10-11; Rev. 5:6, 11-12). ",
  "6717":"Christ as God's manifestation in the flesh has been preached as the gospel among the nations, including the nation of Israel, from the day of Pentecost (Rom. 16:26; Eph. 3:8). ",
  "6718":"Christ as the embodiment of God in the flesh has been believed on, received as Savior and life, by people in the world (Acts 13:48). ",
  "6719":"This refers to Christ's ascension into glory (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; Phil. 2:9). According to the sequence of historical events, Christ's ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. However, it is listed here as the last step in Christ's being the manifestation of God in the flesh. This must indicate that the church too is taken up in glory. Hence, it implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters, with the oversight of the episcopate and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in ch. 3, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness &#151; Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh! ",
  "6720":"What follows is in contrast to what is mentioned in 3:16. ",
  "6721":"This is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit and speaks to us there (Rom. 8:9-11, 16). In order to listen to the Spirit's speaking and be kept from the deceiving spirits and teachings of demons, we need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear. ",
  "6722":"Referring to times after the writing of this book, differing from the last days in 2 Tim. 3:1, which denotes the closing period of this age. ",
  "6723":"Objective faith, the contents of our belief. See notes 19 in ch. 1 and 9 in ch. 3. ",
  "6724":"The deceiving spirits are in contrast to the Spirit, as mentioned in 1 John 4:2, 6. These are the fallen angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion and became his subordinates who work for his kingdom of darkness (Matt. 25:41; Eph. 6:12 and note 2). ",
  "6725":"These are the unclean and evil spirits (Matt. 12:22, 43; Luke 8:2) of the races that lived on earth in the preadamic age and that joined Satan's rebellion and were judged by God (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). After being judged, they became demons, who work on earth for Satan's kingdom. They are different from the deceiving spirits. ",
  "6726":"This phrase modifies teachings of demons in v. 1. The teachings of demons are carried out by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies. This indicates that demons and those who speak lies collaborate to deceive people. ",
  "6727":"The conscience of hypocritical liars has lost its sense, as if branded with a hot iron. This book strongly stresses the conscience. In the church life the love that is contrary to envy and discord is out of a good conscience (1:5). Those who thrust away a good conscience become shipwrecked regarding the faith (1:19). The serving ones in the church must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (3:9). To keep a good and pure conscience is to keep the conscience sensitive in its function. This will safeguard us from the demonic and hypocritical teachings of deceiving liars. ",
  "6728":"A hot iron that brands the slaves and cattle of a certain owner. ",
  "6729":"Marriage and eating were ordained by God. Eating is for the existence of mankind, and marriage is for the continuation and multiplication of mankind. On the one hand, Satan causes men to abuse these two things in the indulgence of their lustful flesh; on the other hand, he overstresses asceticism in forbidding men to marry and in commanding men to abstain from certain foods. This is a demonic teaching! ",
  "6730":"All edible things were created by God for men to live on. We should partake of them with thanksgiving to God out of a grateful heart. ",
  "6731":"To believe is to be saved and thus begin the spiritual life; to have full knowledge of the truth is to realize God's purpose in His economy and to grow unto maturity in the spiritual life. ",
  "6732":"See note 4 in ch. 2. ",
  "6733":"This is contrary to Gnosticism, which teaches that some created things are evil, and to certain ascetic teachings that command men to abstain from certain foods. ",
  "6734":"Separated unto God for His purpose. ",
  "6735":"The word of our prayer addressed to God, of which part could be quotations from the Scriptures, and part could be messages we hear and read. ",
  "6736":"See note 1 in ch. 2. Here intercession refers to our prayer to God for the food we eat, which separates our food from being common and sanctifies it unto God for His purpose, i.e., to nourish us so that we may live for Him. ",
  "6737":"A minister of Christ is one who serves people with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing to people. He differs from the teacher of the law and of other things (1:7, 3). ",
  "6738":"Or, nourishing yourself. Being nourished is for growth in life, which is a matter of life; it differs from being merely taught, which is a matter of knowledge. To minister Christ to others requires that first we ourselves be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ. ",
  "6739":"See note 1. The words of the faith are the words of the full gospel concerning God's New Testament economy. ",
  "6740":"The words of the good teaching are the sweet words that contain and convey the riches of Christ to nourish, edify, and strengthen His believers. ",
  "6741":"We must first closely follow the words which we would teach others. ",
  "6742":"Touching and being touched by worldliness; contrary to being holy. ",
  "6743":"See note 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "6744":"Or, reject, avoid. ",
  "6745":"As in gymnastics. Unto godliness means with a view to godliness. Godliness is Christ lived out of us to be the manifestation of God (see notes 16 and 16 in ch. 3). Today this very Christ is the Spirit dwelling in our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit to live Christ in our daily life. ",
  "6746":"In contrast to all things. Denoting a few things, to a small part of our being. ",
  "6747":"Things that are not only of one part of our being but of all parts &#151; physical, psychological, and spiritual, temporal and eternal. ",
  "6748":"The promise of the present life, a life that is in this age, is like the promises in Matt. 6:33; John 16:33; Phil. 4:6-7; 1 Pet. 5:8-10; etc. The promise of the coming life, a life that is in the next age and in eternity, is like those in 2 Pet. 1:10-11, 2 Tim. 2:12, Rev. 2:7, 17; 21:6-7; etc. A promise like that in Mark 10:29-30 is of both the present life and the coming life. ",
  "6749":"Because our God is living, we can set our hope on Him. ",
  "6750":"Although Timothy was young, he was charged by the apostle to bear the responsibility of caring for the building up of a local church and appointing elders and deacons. For the carrying out of such a responsibility, he was charged not to be childish but to be a pattern to the believers. ",
  "6751":"Or, utterance. ",
  "6752":"Pure in motive and action, without mixture. ",
  "6753":"Reading not in the sense of study but aloud in public. According to the context, this kind of public reading may be for exhortation and teaching. ",
  "6754":"Probably a teaching gift, according to the context of vv. 11, 13, and 16. The following verses also may confirm this: 1 Tim. 1:3; 4:6; 5:7; 6:2, 12, 20; 2 Tim. 1:13-14; 2:2, 14-15, 24-25; 4:2, 5. ",
  "6755":"This indicates that the gift mentioned here is not an outward endowment but the inward ability of life that enables one to minister to others. It is not a miraculous gift, such as speaking in tongues and healing (1 Cor. 12:28), but a gift of grace, such as teaching and exhorting (Rom. 12:7-8). ",
  "6756":"See note 18 in ch. 1. ",
  "6757":"The laying on of hands has two functions: one for identification, as in Lev. 1:4, and the other for impartation, as here. Impartation is based on identification; without identification, there is no basis for imparting something. Through identification, signified by the laying on of the hands of the elders and the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 1:6), the gift of grace was imparted to Timothy. ",
  "6758":"Meaning not merely the elders but the body of elders, the elderhood, implying that they were in one accord, all acting as one. The elders, who are the overseers (3:2), represent a local church, which is the expression of the Body of Christ. The laying on of the hands of the presbytery signifies that the Body of Christ participated with God in imparting the gift of grace to Timothy. This was not a personal matter but a Body matter. ",
  "6759":"I.e., be immersed in. ",
  "6760":"Or, advancement. ",
  "6761":"Or, pay close attention to. ",
  "6762":"Rebuke sharply. ",
  "6763":"The stress is on the supplying of material things. ",
  "6764":"The verb form of the Greek word for godliness. See note 16 in ch. 3. ",
  "6765":"Requital, recompense, offered to show gratitude to one's parents. ",
  "6766":"I.e., his relatives. All the instructions in this chapter are very human, normal, and ordinary; nothing is special, miraculous, or supernatural, including even the matter of healing. The whole book is written in the same principle. This is necessary for the church life. ",
  "6767":"See notes 19 in ch. 1 and 9 in ch. 3. ",
  "6768":"See note 7 in ch. 3. ",
  "6769":"Lit., faith; denoting a pledge, a promise. This indicates that some promised, pledged, to devote themselves in their widowhood to some service of the church. ",
  "6770":"The word in 1 Cor. 7:8 was the apostle's wish in his earlier ministry. In this verse is the apostle's advice in his later ministry, given according to his experiences concerning young widows. ",
  "6771":"Childbearing and housekeeping are a rescue and safeguard to the idle busybodies (v. 13). This is God's ordination in order to restrict and protect fallen women (Gen. 3:16). ",
  "6772":"The noun form of honor in v. 3. According to v. 18, the emphasis here is on material supply. ",
  "6773":"All elders should be able to take the lead in a local church, but some, not all, have a special capacity for teaching. ",
  "6774":"Word here denotes the general speaking of doctrines; teaching denotes special instruction concerning particular things. ",
  "6775":"Timothy was charged by the apostle Paul to receive an accusation against an elder. This indicates that after they have appointed men as elders, the apostles still have the authority to deal with the elders. ",
  "6776":"This too indicates the apostles' authority over the elders. ",
  "6777":"Referring to the whole church. A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position. ",
  "6778":"The elders in a local church are God's deputy authority. Dealing with the elders is a solemn thing before God. Hence, the apostle solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the angels to carry out such a dealing, that the chosen angels, the good angels with God's authority, might see that His authority was established and was being maintained among His redeemed people on earth. ",
  "6779":"Prejudgment, condemnation, formed or applied before hearing the case. ",
  "6780":"Inclination, favor, bias. Without prejudice implies that no prejudgment should be made to the credit of the accuser; nothing by way of partiality implies that no perverted favor should be shown to the accused (elder). ",
  "6781":"See note 14 in ch. 4. According to the context of the previous verses, the laying on of hands here refers primarily to the laying of hands on the elders. ",
  "6782":"Or, hastily. ",
  "6783":"According to the context, this verse implies that the state of one's physical health may affect his dealing with others spiritually. ",
  "6784":"Or, weaknesses. ",
  "6785":"This word indicates that v. 24 is a continuation of v. 22. It explains that the sins of some people are openly manifest earlier, and the sins of others, later. Hence, one should not lay hands on people in haste. ",
  "6786":"What is mentioned here concerning the judging of sins is a principle that is applicable to both man's judgment and God's. ",
  "6787":"Referring to sins. ",
  "6788":"The sins of others also will be manifest, going to judgment later. ",
  "6789":"The implication of the apostle's charge to Timothy in these two verses is that one should not approve a person hastily because his sins are not openly manifest, nor condemn a person in haste because his good works are not manifest. ",
  "6790":"Lit., the teaching; referring to the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). ",
  "6791":"Ill spoken of, reproached. ",
  "6792":"Lit., serve as slaves. ",
  "6793":"See note 3 in ch. 1. ",
  "6794":"See note 10 in ch. 1. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, they are healthy words. ",
  "6795":"See notes 2 in ch. 2, 16 and 16 in ch. 3, and 7 in ch. 4. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching that is according to godliness. When the Lord's words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching that is according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness &#151; a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ. ",
  "6796":"See note 6 in ch. 3. Teachings that differ from the healthy words of the Lord always issue from people's pride and self-conceit, which blind them. ",
  "6797":"To question and contend about words is a disease. Diseased here is in contrast to healthy in v. 3. ",
  "6798":"Lit., blasphemies; referring here, as in Col. 3:8, to slanders and railings toward man, not blasphemies toward God. ",
  "6799":"Or, incessant quarrels. ",
  "6800":"Or, bereft, destitute. The Greek here implies that they had once possessed the truth, but that now it was put away from them. Hence, they were destitute of the truth. ",
  "6801":"See note 15 in ch. 3. ",
  "6802":"Making godliness a way to gain (material profit), a gain-making trade. ",
  "6803":"\"An inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favorite Stoic word\" (Vincent). ",
  "6804":"I.e., the best way to gain. The word gain here refers mainly to the blessings in this age &#151; godliness plus self-sufficiency and the ability to dispense with greediness and the cares of this age. ",
  "6805":"This is wisely ordained by God that we may trust in Him for our needs and live by Him in order to express Him, without preoccupation or distraction. ",
  "6806":"Although this refers to clothing, it may include a dwelling. ",
  "6807":"Sufficiently provided for. ",
  "6808":"With a strong desire to be rich. This is the love, not the possession, of riches, which leads the avaricious into temptation. Some are actually rich; some desire to be rich. This evil desire ruins and destroys them. ",
  "6809":"Lustful desires, lusts. ",
  "6810":"Or, drown, sink. ",
  "6811":"Destruction implies ruin, and ruin implies temporal and eternal perdition. ",
  "6812":"Not the only root. ",
  "6813":"Craving for, longing for. ",
  "6814":"Or, wandered. ",
  "6815":"See note 9 in ch. 3. So also in vv. 12, 21. ",
  "6816":"One who partakes of God's life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Pet. 1:4), thus being one with God in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expressing Him. This corresponds with the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh (3:16). ",
  "6817":"To be right with people before God according to His righteous and strict requirements. ",
  "6818":"To live a daily life that manifests God. See note 16 in ch. 3. ",
  "6819":"To believe in God and His word and to trust in Him and His word. ",
  "6820":"To love others by the love of God (1 John 4:7-8, 19-21). ",
  "6821":"To endure sufferings and persecutions. ",
  "6822":"A proper attitude in facing opposition. See note 5 in Matt. 5. ",
  "6823":"Lit., Struggle the good struggle of the faith. ",
  "6824":"I.e., the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is eternal. Eternal denotes the nature more than the time element of the divine life. To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, and especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life, not trusting in our human life. Hence, in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, eternal life is stressed again and again (1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7). To carry out God's economy concerning the church, as seen in 1 Timothy, to confront the downward trend of the church's decline, as seen in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church, as seen in Titus, this life is a prerequisite. ",
  "6825":"Lit., into; i.e., to participate in, to enjoy. We have been called into the eternal life of God. We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ. ",
  "6826":"The good confession refers to the good faith, the full gospel that Christians believe. Probably at his baptism, Timothy confessed the good confession, confessing to the eternal life before many witnesses, believing and being assured that he had received the life of God. We all should confess such a good confession. ",
  "6827":"This commandment should refer to the charge in vv. 11-12. ",
  "6828":"I.e., the Lord's second coming. ",
  "6829":"Referring to appearing in v. 14. ",
  "6830":"Referring to God the Father, according to Acts 1:7. ",
  "6831":"Referring to the distributing of material things readily to the needy, and to the sharing of riches willingly with them. ",
  "6832":"Not merely rich in material things but rich in good works according to God's pleasure (Eph. 2:10). ",
  "6833":"The future here refers to the next age (as compared with the present age in v. 17), the kingdom age, when the overcoming saints will enjoy the Lord's reward. For this we all need to lay a good foundation in the present age as a treasure for us to enjoy in the future. ",
  "6834":"I.e., the eternal life referred to in v. 12. Material riches are for the human natural life in this age, a life that is temporal and, hence, not real. If we do good with material things, we will accomplish something for the real life, laying away a treasure for our enjoyment in the eternal life in the next age. This requires that we lay hold on God's eternal life, which is the real life. Otherwise, we will lay hold on our human natural life in laying away a treasure of material riches in this age for a life that is not real. We should care for the eternal life rather than the natural life. Both v. 12 and this verse stress the eternal life of God. This indicates that the divine life is a factor that is crucial and vital to our Christian life. ",
  "6835":"That which was committed and entrusted to Timothy, the healthy words that he received from Paul, not only for himself but also for others. See note 14 in 2 Tim. 1. ",
  "6836":"The teaching of the false teachers, which they called knowledge (probably related to Gnostic knowledge). Such teaching replaced the genuine knowledge of the healthy word of God that was entrusted to Timothy. ",
  "6837":"Missed the mark, as in shooting. ",
  "6838":"This book was written at a time when the churches established through the apostle's ministry in the Gentile world were in a trend of degradation and the apostle himself was confined in a remote prison. Many had turned away from him and forsaken him (v. 15; 4:16), including even some of his co-workers (4:10). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow worker and spiritual child, Timothy. Because of this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ not only through the will of God but also according to the promise of life, which is in Christ. This implies that though the churches may become degraded and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same. With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God was laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation (2:19). By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the test of the church's decline. This life, which the apostle in 1 Timothy charged Timothy and others to lay hold on (1 Tim. 6:12, 19), must have been an encouragement and strengthening to the apostle in perilous times. ",
  "6839":"Only in 1 and 2 Timothy, among all his Epistles, did the apostle include God's mercy in the opening greeting. God's mercy reaches farther than His grace. In the degraded situation of the churches, God's mercy is needed. This mercy brings in God's rich grace, which is sufficient to deal with any degradation. ",
  "6840":"To serve God in worship to Him (Acts 24:14; Phil. 3:3). ",
  "6841":"Following in the footsteps of his forefathers to serve God in a pure conscience. ",
  "6842":"See note 9 in 1 Tim. 3. In a time of degradation a pure conscience is needed for one to serve God. ",
  "6843":"Lit., indwelt. ",
  "6844":"This was written to encourage and strengthen Timothy in his ministry for the Lord, which might have been enfeebled by Paul's imprisonment and the degraded situation of the churches. ",
  "6845":"See note 14 in 1 Tim. 4. ",
  "6846":"The spirit here denotes our human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). To fan into flame the gift of God (v. 6) is related to our regenerated spirit. ",
  "6847":"Of power refers to our will, of love to our emotion, and of sobermindedness to our mind. This indicates that having a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind has very much to do with having a strong spirit for the exercise of the gift of God that is in us. ",
  "6848":"This was the reason Paul charged Timothy in vv. 6-7 to fan into flame by a strong spirit the gift of God that was in him. ",
  "6849":"Not to be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord is to stand against the downward current in the declining churches. ",
  "6850":"Since the gospel, personified here (cf. note 2 in Rev. 6), was suffering persecution, Timothy needed to suffer evil along with the gospel. ",
  "6851":"Our suffering of persecution along with the gospel must be to the extent that the power of God, not our natural strength, can endure. ",
  "6852":"God not only saved us to enjoy His blessing but also called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular goal, in order to fulfill His purpose. ",
  "6853":"God's purpose is His plan according to His will to put us into Christ and make us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony. Grace is God's provision in life given to us that we may live out His purpose. ",
  "6854":"I.e., before the world began. The grace given to us in Christ was bestowed on us before the world began. This is a sure and unshakable foundation that stands firm against the downward current and exposes the utter powerlessness of the enemy's efforts to counter the eternal purpose of God. In order to strengthen Timothy, the apostle identified their ministry with this. ",
  "6855":"God's grace was given to us in eternity, but it was manifested and applied to us through our Lord's first coming, in which He nullified death and brought life to us. ",
  "6856":"Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54). ",
  "6857":"The eternal life of God, which is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4). It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle (v. 1). This life and the incorruption that is its consequence have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel. ",
  "6858":"Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life's saturating of our body (Rom. 8:11). This life and incorruption are able to counter the death and corruption brought in by the decline among the churches. ",
  "6859":"Referring to the gospel of divine grace and eternal life, corresponding with the gospel in grace and life presented by the apostle John (John 1:4, 16-17). For such a gospel Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher. ",
  "6860":"A herald announces and proclaims the gospel, an apostle sets up and establishes the churches for God's administration, and a teacher gives instructions to the churches with all the saints. See note 7 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "6861":"The apostle suffered for a cause, a cause on the highest plane &#151; the proclaiming of the glad tidings of the gospel of grace and life to establish the churches, and the directing of the saints. Such a cause must have been an encouragement and strengthening to Timothy as he faced the deterioration of the declining churches. ",
  "6862":"So Timothy should not have been ashamed either (v. 8). ",
  "6863":"The apostle believed not a thing or a matter but a living person, Christ, the Son of the living God, who is the embodiment of divine grace and eternal life. The eternal life in Him is powerful; it is more than able to sustain to the end the one who suffers for His sake, and to preserve him for the inheritance of the coming glory. The grace in Him was more than sufficient to provide His sent one with all he needed for finishing the course of his ministry unto a reward in glory (4:7-8). Hence, He was able to guard that which the apostle had committed unto Him for the day of His return. Such an assurance must also have been an encouragement and strengthening to the enfeebled and sorrowful Timothy. ",
  "6864":"Or, that which I have committed unto Him. The apostle committed his entire being with his glorious future unto the One who was able, through His life and grace, to guard his deposit for the day of His second appearing. ",
  "6865":"The day of Christ's second appearing. ",
  "6866":"Or, example. The word in v. 12 is a pattern, an example, of healthy words. ",
  "6867":"See note 3 in 1 Tim. 6. ",
  "6868":"See note 14 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "6869":"This is the deposit the Lord entrusted to us, in contrast to the deposit we entrusted to Him, mentioned in v. 12. According to v. 13, the deposit here must refer to the deposit of healthy words, including the riches of life in His word, which the Lord has stored in us. See note 20 in 1 Tim. 6. ",
  "6870":"Lit., is indwelling. The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:16). Hence, for us to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit. ",
  "6871":"I.e., the province of Asia. The phrase all who are in Asia points to the general situation among the believers in Asia and does not include every particular believer; for Onesiphorus is mentioned as one from Asia who often refreshed Paul and sought him out (vv. 16-18). ",
  "6872":"This indicates that the believers in Asia who had formerly received the apostle's ministry now forsook him. In spite of such desertion, the apostle grew stronger in the grace that was in Christ, who is the same and will never change. Not being discouraged, he exhorted his son in faith to persevere steadily in the ministry in the midst of the failure and ruin of the churches. ",
  "6873":"These two must be the ones who took the lead to desert the apostle because of his imprisonment (cf. v. 8). ",
  "6874":"He was an overcomer who surmounted the general trend and stood against the downward current to refresh the Lord's ambassador in spirit, soul, and body, not being ashamed of the apostle's imprisonment on behalf of the Lord's commission. ",
  "6875":"The day of the Lord's victorious appearing to reward His overcomers (4:8; Rev. 22:12). ",
  "6876":"The apostle himself had experienced the empowering of grace in life (1:9-12). Now he exhorted Timothy to be empowered in the same grace. ",
  "6877":"See note 9 in ch. 1. ",
  "6878":"I.e., the healthy words (1:13). ",
  "6879":"The healthy words, after being committed to faithful men, become the good deposit in them (1:14). This word indicates that if someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord's healthy words, he should train the faithful ones that they too may have a good deposit from the Lord and be competent to teach others. ",
  "6880":"Trustworthy. ",
  "6881":"The apostle considered their ministry a warfare for Christ, just as the priestly service was considered a military service, a warfare, in Num. 4:23, 30, 35 (lit.). ",
  "6882":"To fight a good fight (4:7) for the Lord's interests on this earth, we must clear away all earthly entanglements. ",
  "6883":"The Greek word (bios) denotes the physical life in this age. ",
  "6884":"Here Timothy is likened to an athlete contending in the games. ",
  "6885":"See note 25 in 1 Cor. 9. ",
  "6886":"Here the apostle likened Timothy to a farmer. A soldier must win the victory, an athlete must receive the crown, and a farmer must partake of the fruits, the food. ",
  "6887":"Indicating Christ's victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power. ",
  "6888":"Indicating Christ's dignified human nature, which was exalted and glorified along with His divine nature. ",
  "6889":"The apostle's gospel is the glad tidings of the living person, Christ, who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, who was incarnated to be the Son of Man and resurrected to be the Son of God, as related in the parallel portion, Rom. 1:1-4. ",
  "6890":"In spite of all the opposition by human efforts that were instigated by the enemy, Satan, the bonds of the apostle caused the word of God to be released, to be preached by men freely and to become more prevailing. ",
  "6891":"The believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4) and selected from among mankind for salvation. The apostle endured all sufferings for the sake of us, the chosen ones, that we too may obtain salvation, as he did. ",
  "6892":"It is not salvation and eternal glory but salvation with eternal glory. Eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God's salvation (Rom. 8:21); God's salvation leads us into His glory (Heb. 2:10). This encourages us to endure sufferings for the gospel (Rom. 8:17). ",
  "6893":"The portion from here to the end of v. 13 might have been a hymn. This passage corresponds with Rom. 6:8 and 8:17. ",
  "6894":"In Christ's crucifixion, as symbolized by baptism (Rom. 6:3-8). ",
  "6895":"In Christ's resurrection (Rom. 6:5, 8; John 14:19). ",
  "6896":"In this age. ",
  "6897":"In the coming age. ",
  "6898":"Not acknowledge us (Matt. 10:33; Luke 12:9). ",
  "6899":"Faithful to His own word. ",
  "6900":"If we become faithless toward Him, though He remains faithful, He cannot accept us as faithful by making Himself unfaithful, i.e., by denying Himself (His nature and His being). ",
  "6901":"Or, overthrowing. Lit., catastrophe. ",
  "6902":"As in carpentry. It means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. ",
  "6903":"See notes 4 in 1 Tim. 2 and 15 in 1 Tim. 3. Contentions of words (v. 14), profane, vain babblings (v. 16), the word that eats away like gangrene (v. 17), and foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind (v. 23) are often used by the devil (v. 26) in the downward current among the churches to beget contentions (v. 23), to ruin the hearers (v. 14), to promote ungodliness (v. 16), and to overthrow people's faith (v. 18). Hence, there is the need of the word of the truth, rightly unfolded, to enlighten the darkened people, inoculate against the poison, swallow up the death, and bring the distracted back to the proper track. ",
  "6904":"See note 7 in 1 Tim. 4. ",
  "6905":"Contrary to godliness. See note 2 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "6906":"Or, feed, eat. Lit., have pasture; cf. John 10:9. The word for pasture in Greek is the medical term for the consuming progress of a mortifying disease (Alford). Hence, here the Greek phrase is rendered spread. ",
  "6907":"An eating sore, a cancer. ",
  "6908":"See note 15 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "6909":"I.e., missed the mark, swerved, deviated. ",
  "6910":"I.e., that there will be no resurrection. This is a serious heresy that denies the divine power in life (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Rev. 20:4, 6). ",
  "6911":"This is the subjective faith, i.e., the act of believing; it is very much related to the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 10:9). ",
  "6912":"Verses 14-18 give instruction concerning how to deal with heresies, on the negative side, and handle the truth, on the positive side. According to the context of vv. 15, 18, and 25, the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church (1 Cor. 3:11) but to the church as the foundation of the truth. This corresponds with the base of the truth, which holds the truth (1 Tim. 3:15), especially the truth of the resurrection of Christ (Acts 4:33). <br><br>   The church is built with the divine life in Christ, a life that is indestructible, unconquerable (Heb. 7:16; Acts 2:24), and able to withstand deathly decline originating from any source. Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God that stands forever against any heresy. ",
  "6913":"The seal has two sides. On the Lord's side it is: \"The Lord knows those who are His.\" This is based on the Lord's divine life, which He has given to all His believers and which has brought them into an organic union with Him, making them one with Him and causing them to become His. On our side it is: \"Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.\" This is the issue of the divine life &#151; it enables us to depart from unrighteousness and keeps us blameless in His holy name. The church as the firm foundation in the divine life bears such a two-sided seal, testifying that the Lord's divine life has made us His and has kept us from things that are contrary to His righteous way. <br><br>   Verse 19 indicates definitely that the ones exposed in vv. 16-18 are not the Lord's. Their evildoings are a strong proof of this. ",
  "6914":"In contrast to the definition in v. 19 concerning genuine believers. ",
  "6915":"The house of God defined in 1 Tim. 3:15-16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth; whereas the great house here refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally large tree in Matt. 13:31-32 (see note 32 in Matt. 13). In this great house there are not only precious vessels but also base ones. ",
  "6916":"Honorable vessels are constituted of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the sure foundation that holds the truth. ",
  "6917":"Dishonorable vessels are constituted of the fallen human nature (wood and earth). Hymenaeus, Philetus, and other false believers belong to this category. ",
  "6918":"This is to depart from unrighteousness (v. 19), as an outward evidence of the inward divine nature. ",
  "6919":"Referring to vessels unto dishonor, including those mentioned in vv. 16-18. ",
  "6920":"Unto honor is a matter of nature, sanctified a matter of position, useful a matter of practice, and prepared a matter of training. ",
  "6921":"Timothy had to be wary not only of outward corruption among the churches but also of inward lusts within himself. He had to avoid the outward corruption and flee the inward lusts. ",
  "6922":"Righteousness is toward oneself, faith is toward God, and love is toward others; peace is the issue of these three virtues. ",
  "6923":"This is to name the name of the Lord (v. 19) in our prayer and praise to Him. The Lord's seekers must be His callers. ",
  "6924":"See note 5 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "6925":"Or, stupid. ",
  "6926":"Uneducated, undisciplined, unlearned, i.e., not subject to God but following one's own mind and will (Darby). ",
  "6927":"This indicates that with the opposers of the truth it is the heart and conscience that are in question. The truth is the revelation of the living God and His economy, His heart's desire. To receive the divine revelation, the heart and conscience need to be rightly exercised toward God. The heart should be turned to Him, directed solely to Him, and the conscience must be pure and void of offense before Him. Otherwise, one may be carried away as a captive by the devil and thus fall into his snare (v. 26). ",
  "6928":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 2. This word proves that the opposers lack adequate knowledge of the divine revelation. ",
  "6929":"Become sober again, awake out of a drunken stupor (Vincent). ",
  "6930":"This indicates that the opposers of the truth have been captured and kept in a snare by the devil. The enemy of God occupies their reprobate mind with error and shuts God out, just as he did with the Pharisees (John 8:42-45). Such opposers need to turn to God in their heart and have a thorough dealing in their conscience. ",
  "6931":"See note 10 in Rev. 2. ",
  "6932":"I.e., for God's will, to do God's will. ",
  "6933":"In contrast to the hope expressed at the end of the preceding chapter. ",
  "6934":"Denoting the present age (2 Pet. 3:3; Jude 18), which began with Christ's first coming (1 Pet. 1:20) and will last until His second appearing. That this period was to be lengthy was not revealed to the apostles (Matt. 24:36); they expected the Lord to return in their generation. ",
  "6935":"Or, hard times, grievous times, perilous times. ",
  "6936":"The prophetic picture presented in vv. 2-5 portrays not the evil condition of the non-Christian society but the corrupted situation of the great house mentioned in 2:20, which is Christianity in decline. This is proved by the phrase having an outward form of godliness in v. 5. Non-Christians do not have even the outward form of godliness. ",
  "6937":"In 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus seven kinds of lovers are mentioned: (1) lovers of self, (2) lovers of money (v. 2; 1 Tim. 6:10), (3) lovers of pleasure, (4) lovers of God (v. 4), (5) lovers of good (Titus 1:8), (6) lovers of husbands, and (7) lovers of children (Titus 2:4). Also, two kinds of nonlovers are mentioned: (1) nonlovers of good, and (2) nonlovers of God (vv. 3-4). Whatever one loves, his whole heart, even his entire being, is set on and occupied and possessed by. This is crucial! Whether there would be a day of glory in the church's victory or grievous days of the church's decline depends altogether on what kind of lovers we are. History tells us that the root of the church's decline was the loss of her first love toward the Lord (Rev. 2:4). To maintain the victorious standard of the church, we must be lovers of God and lovers of the good that pertains to God's economy. ",
  "6938":"Or, haughty. ",
  "6939":"Lit., blasphemers; as in 1 Tim. 1:13. Here, however, it does not refer to blasphemers of God but to revilers or railers, those who speak evilly and injuriously against men. ",
  "6940":"Or, ungrateful. ",
  "6941":"Or, irreconcilable. ",
  "6942":"Or, betrayers. ",
  "6943":"Or, headstrong. ",
  "6944":"See note 6 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "6945":"In this picture there are three kinds of lovers &#151; lovers of self, lovers of money, and lovers of pleasure &#151; and two kinds of nonlovers &#151; nonlovers of good and nonlovers of God. ",
  "6946":"Merely an outward semblance without the essential reality. ",
  "6947":"The real and practical virtue with a living influence to express God. ",
  "6948":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "6949":"According to Jewish tradition, these two were the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses in Exo. 7:11, 22. ",
  "6950":"See note 15 in 1 Tim. 3. In the decline among the churches, truth is the target of the enemy's attack. Hence, truth is also the remedy for and the rescue from the diseased and ruined situation. ",
  "6951":"Or, reprobate. ",
  "6952":"See note 1 in 1 Tim. 4. ",
  "6953":"The lack of intelligence and the senselessness in their doings. ",
  "6954":"Jannes and Jambres, who were defeated and brought to nothing (Exo. 8:18; 9:11). ",
  "6955":"I.e., manner of life. ",
  "6956":"This Greek word is used in Paul's Epistles in relation to the purpose of God (Rom. 9:11). ",
  "6957":"The city where Timothy lived (Acts 16:1-2), near Iconium and Pisidian Antioch. ",
  "6958":"Or, determine. ",
  "6959":"I.e., live a life of godliness. See notes 2 in 1 Tim. 2, and 16 16 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "6960":"Juggling impostors. This verse indicates that the decline of the church will become worse. ",
  "6961":"Or, abide. ",
  "6962":"The things that Timothy learned from the apostle and was assured of constituted the vital portion of the content of the New Testament, a portion that completed the divine revelation (Col. 1:25). Hence, he had practical apprehension of a great part of the New Testament. ",
  "6963":"In addition to his knowledge of the New Testament, Timothy had, from his childhood, a good foundation in the knowledge of the Old Testament. He was one who was fully perfected and equipped to minister the word of God, not only in caring for a local church but also in confronting the worsening decline of the church. ",
  "6964":"Cf. note 22 in Rom. 3. ",
  "6965":"Or, Every Scripture God-breathed is also profitable. To confront the death, corruption, and confusion in the church's decline, the eternal life, on which ch. 1 is based (1:1, 10), the divine truth, emphasized in ch. 2 (2:15, 18, 25), and the holy Scripture, highly regarded in ch. 3 (3:14-17), are all needed. The eternal life not only swallows up death but also renders the life supply; the divine truth replaces the vanity of corruption with the reality of all the divine riches; and the holy Scripture not only dispels the confusion but also furnishes divine light and revelation. Hence, in this book the apostle stressed these three things. ",
  "6966":"This indicates that the Scripture, the word of God, is the breathing out of God. God's speaking is God's breathing out. Hence, His word is spirit (John 6:63), or breath. Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire. <br><br>   As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture (God's word) is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God's living Word (Rev. 19:13), and the Scripture is God's written word (Matt. 4:4). ",
  "6967":"Reproof, confutation. ",
  "6968":"Setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, restoring to an upright state. ",
  "6969":"Discipline or chastisement according to righteousness; to discipline or chastise by the element and condition of righteousness. ",
  "6970":"See note 11 in 1 Tim. 6. ",
  "6971":"Complete and perfect in qualifications. ",
  "6972":"Or, fitted out, furnished, made ready. ",
  "6973":"God has given all judgment to Christ because He is a man (John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; 17:31; Rom. 2:16). As the righteous Judge (v. 8), Christ will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46), and He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). ",
  "6974":"This word proves that, in his life and work, Paul took the Lord's appearing and His kingdom as the incentive and goal. The Lord's appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12), and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). The apostle not only took these two matters as the incentive and goal for himself but also by these two matters charged Timothy, who was under his leading, to faithfully fulfill his ministry of the word. ",
  "6975":"Composed of what Timothy learned of both Paul and the Old Testament (3:14-15). This proves that vv. 1-2 are a continuation of 3:14-17. In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church's decline, the proclaiming of the word is vital. ",
  "6976":"Be urgent, stand by. ",
  "6977":"Opportunely or inopportunely, whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether you are welcome or unwelcome. ",
  "6978":"Implying to condemn severely. ",
  "6979":"All also modifies teaching &#151; teaching in many aspects and directions. The carrying out of such teaching requires long-suffering. ",

  "6985":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "6986":"Fill up the full measure of your ministry. ",
  "6987":"The ministry of the word, which is to minister Christ in all His riches (Eph. 3:8) to both sinners and believers for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). Such a ministry is desperately needed to counter the trend of decline, as prophesied in vv. 3-4. ",
  "6988":"As a drink offering (see note 17 in Phil. 2). To be poured out is to shed one's blood. Already being poured out indicates that the process had begun. ",
  "6989":"From the world to be with the Lord (Phil. 1:23), through martyrdom. Paul was imprisoned in Rome twice. The first imprisonment was from about A.D. 62-64 and was due to the Jews' accusation (Acts 28:17-20). During that time Paul wrote the Epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, and Philippians, and the Epistle to Philemon. After his release from the first imprisonment (a release that he expected in Phil. 1:25; 2:24; and Philem. 22), he must have visited Ephesus and Macedonia (1 Tim. 1:3), where he probably wrote the first Epistle to Timothy. Then he visited Crete (Titus 1:5); Nicopolis (Titus 3:12), where he wrote the Epistle to Titus; Troas; and Miletus (vv. 13, 20), where he probably wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. During his second imprisonment, which occurred in about A.D. 67 and was due to Caesar Nero's sudden persecution, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy while expecting his imminent martyrdom for his Master. ",
  "6990":"Lit., struggled the good struggle. A proper Christian life has three aspects: fighting the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness for the interests of God's kingdom (1 Tim. 6:12); running the course for the carrying out of God's economy according to His eternal purpose (Heb. 12:1); and keeping the faith for participation in the divine riches in God's economy (1 Tim. 3:9). In this Paul set up an adequate pattern for us. ",
  "6991":"Paul began to run the heavenly race after the Lord took possession of him, and he continually ran (1 Cor. 9:24-26; Phil. 3:12-14) that he might finish it (Acts 20:24). Now at the end he triumphantly proclaimed, \"I have finished the course.\" For this he will receive from the Lord a reward &#151; the crown of righteousness. ",
  "6992":"Reserved. ",
  "6993":"The crown, a symbol of glory, is given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). In contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), this prize is not of grace nor by faith, but is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). The believers will be recompensed with such a reward, not according to the Lord's grace but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is the crown of righteousness. The Recompenser is the Lord as the righteous Judge. Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and that he would be recompensed with it at the day of the Lord's second appearing. ",
  "6994":"Not the merciful God or the gracious Redeemer. ",
  "6995":"See note 12 in ch. 1. ",
  "6996":"The Lord's appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to us. We should love it and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy. By that appearing the apostle charged Timothy to fulfill his ministry (vv. 1-2, 5). ",
  "6997":"In contrast to loved His appearing in v. 8. ",
  "6998":"A region in southeast Europe adjacent to Macedonia. ",
  "6999":"Probably a cloak or case for traveling. ",
  "7000":"A seaport in northwest Asia Minor, where Paul received the Macedonian call (Acts 16:8-11). ",
  "7001":"Rolls made of papyrus. ",
  "7002":"A figure of speech for any evil matter (v. 18) or evil person (1 Cor. 15:32 and note 2). ",
  "7003":"This is \"the kingdom of their Father\" (Matt. 13:43), \"the kingdom of My Father\" (Matt. 26:29), \"the kingdom of Christ and of God\" (Eph. 5:5), and \"the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\" (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in v. 8 and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly race. (See notes 3 in Matt. 5 and 28 in Heb. 12.) The apostle Paul's word here and in v. 8 proves that this reward was an incentive to him. ",
  "7004":"A city in Asia Minor near Ephesus (Acts 20:15, 17). ",
  "7005":"Why did the apostle leave in sickness one who was so intimate to him, without exercising healing prayer for him? Why did he not exercise his healing gift (Acts 19:11-12) to cure Timothy of his stomach sickness rather than instruct him to take the natural way for healing (1 Tim. 5:23)? The answer to both questions is that he and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in that time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is a matter of grace in life; the latter is a matter of gift in power &#151; miraculous power. In the decline of the church and in one's suffering for the church, the gift of power is not needed as much as the grace in life. ",
  "7006":"This book, which gives instructions on how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit. In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit was given to us, a spirit by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord's life-imparting grace (1:6-10). In the conclusion it blesses us by emphasizing the Lord's being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace in order to stand against the downward current of the church's decline and carry out God's economy through His indwelling Spirit (1:14) and equipping word (3:16-17). ",
  "7007":"In the grievous days of the worsening of the church's degradation, what is needed is the eternal grace of God, which was given to us in eternity (1:9) and is to be appropriated by us in this age. This grace, which is in the indestructible life, is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, who is the very embodiment of the divine life, dwelling and living in our spirit. We need to exercise our spirit to enjoy the riches of this Christ (Eph. 3:8) as the sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9). Thus we may live Him as our godliness (1 Tim. 4:7-8) for the building up of the church as His testimony, bearing all the divine realities (truths) according to God's economy. ",
  "7008":"Paul was an apostle according to four things: (1) the command of God (1 Tim. 1:1), (2) the promise of life (2 Tim. 1:1), (3) the faith of God's chosen ones, and (4) the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness. The command, on God's side, speaks for Him and requires something of us for Him. Faith, on our side, responds to God's requirements and receives His life. Faith is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God's requirements but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done. The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand. It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God's New Testament economy. ",
  "7009":"See note 10 in 2 Tim. 2. ",
  "7010":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 2. Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith but also according to the full knowledge of the truth. Faith is to receive all God has planned for us, all God has done for us, and all God has given to us. The full knowledge of the truth is a thorough apprehension of the truth, a full acknowledgment and appreciation of the reality of all the spiritual and divine things that we have received through faith. Apostleship is according to such an apprehension and appreciation of the reality of God's eternal economy. ",
  "7011":"The truth, the reality, of God's eternal economy is according to godliness, which is God manifested in man (see notes 16 and 16 in 1 Tim. 3). Apostleship is the dispensing of this reality to God's believing elect and the carrying out of such a godliness among them through preaching, teaching, and administrating in the Word and in the Spirit (1 Tim. 6:3). ",
  "7012":"Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith and the knowledge of the truth but also in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised in eternity. This corresponds with according to the promise of life in 2 Tim. 1:1. In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying on the hope of, eternal life. Eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today but also for us to inherit (Matt. 19:29) in its full extent for eternity. Today's experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future. The enjoyment of eternal life today is a foretaste; the inheritance of eternal life in the coming age and in eternity will be the full taste. This inheritance is the hope of eternal life (see note 7 in ch. 3). This is the blessed hope revealed in 2:13, composed of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:21-25), the salvation to be revealed at the last time (1 Pet. 1:5), and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance kept in the heavens for us (1 Pet. 1:3-4). This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 1:11; 3:13; Rev. 21:6-7), referred to in 1 Tim. 4:8. Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry not based on any benefit in the present life, nor taking the privilege of the law as a condition, but based on this hope as a condition, indicating that for his apostleship he relied on and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel (2 Tim. 1:10). <br><br>   This Epistle concerns the maintaining of order in the churches. For this, the faith of God's chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable. Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth. ",
  "7013":"The divine life, the uncreated life of God, which not only lasts forever timewise but also is eternal and divine in its nature. See note 10 in 2 Tim. 1. ",
  "7014":"This must be the promise of the Father to the Son in eternity. The Father chose us in the Son and predestinated us unto sonship through Him (Eph. 1:5) before the foundation of the world. It must have been in eternity that the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers. By this life the believers, who were given to the Son in eternity (John 17:2), would become His brothers (Heb. 2:11). ",
  "7015":"Before the world began.",
  "7016":"The proper time for the eternal life to be manifested. ",
  "7017":"Equal to eternal life in v. 2. This corresponds with 1 John 1:1-2. ",
  "7018":"See note 1 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "7019":"The faith that is common to all believers (cf. 2 Pet. 1:1). ",
  "7020":"These words, compared with every church in Acts 14:23, indicate not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is the city in which it is located but also that in one city there should be only one church. The eldership of a local church should cover the entire city in which that church is located. Such a unique presbytery in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage. One city should have only one church with one presbytery. This practice is illustrated, beyond any question or doubt, by the clear pattern in the New Testament (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11) and is an absolute prerequisite for the maintaining of proper order in a local church. Because of this, the first thing the apostle charged Titus to do in setting things in order was to appoint elders in every city. ",
  "7021":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7022":"Referring to the elders in v. 5. See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7023":"Not easily provoked. ",
  "7024":"See note 3 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7025":"See note 3 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7026":"See note 8 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7027":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7028":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7029":"See note 75 in Luke 1. ",
  "7030":"The elders are appointed to administrate God's government in a local church that good order may be maintained in the church. To accomplish this, the elders need to hold to the faithful word, which is according to the apostles' teaching, that they may be able to stop troublesome talkers and calm a tumultuous situation (vv. 9-14). ",
  "7031":"The trustworthy, reliable, and true word that was taught in the churches according to the apostles' teaching. The elders in a local church should hold to this kind of healthy word that they may fulfill their duty in teaching (1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17). ",
  "7032":"The teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42) eventually became the New Testament. This indicates that (1) the churches were established according to the apostles' teaching and followed their teaching, and (2) the order of the churches was maintained by the faithful word, which was given according to the apostles' teaching. The disorder in the church was due mainly to deviation from the apostles' teaching. To counter this, we must hold to the faithful word taught in the churches according to the apostles' teaching. In a darkened and confused situation, we must cleave to the enlightening and ordering word in the New Testament &#151; the apostles' teaching. To maintain order in the church, the apostles' word according to God's revelation is needed in addition to the eldership. ",
  "7033":"See note 10 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "7034":"To disclose the true character of anything so as to convict and, hence, reprove someone by exposing his fault. It is translated reprove in Eph. 5:11, 13. ",
  "7035":"Or, the gainsayers. ",
  "7036":"The Jewish believers who were seducers within the church. ",
  "7037":"Stopped by severe reproof (v. 13) with the faithful word, which is according to the apostles' teaching (v. 9). ",
  "7038":"Similar to what the reprobate prophet Balaam did (2 Pet. 2:15-16; Jude 11). ",
  "7039":"The Cretans. All those mentioned in vv. 9b-10 were such. ",
  "7040":"A heathen prophet, probably referring to Epimenides, a native of Crete who lived about 600 B.C., according to a legend.",
  "7041":"Lit., bellies. ",
  "7042":"The same word is translated convict in v. 9. See note 5 there. ",
  "7043":"Or, sharply. ",
  "7044":"The gainsayers (v. 9) and vain talkers (v. 10) were infected with doctrinal diseases and became unhealthy in the faith. They needed the inoculation of the healthy teaching and the healthy word (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3, and notes), which the elders should provide (v. 9) for their healing. ",
  "7045":"Objective faith. See notes 19 in 1 Tim. 1 and 9 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7046":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 1. The Jewish myths might have been the seed of the Gnostic mythologies. ",
  "7047":"According to the next verse, these commandments of the heretics must have been precepts concerning abstinence from meats and other things ordained by God for man's use (cf. 1 Tim. 4:3; Col. 2:20-22). These were the commandments not of the ascetics but of the early Gnostics. What the Gnostics adopted was theosophy, which concerned God and the universe and was based on mystical concepts. It was a theory on understanding the things of God and spirits; that is, it was a philosophy or a form of mysticism that employed physical means to communicate with God and spirits. It came from Jewish sources, and some of it was probably derived from the Mosaic law. ",
  "7048":"Probably referring to those of the circumcision (v. 10). ",
  "7049":"See notes 4 in 1 Tim. 2 and 15 in 1 Tim. 3. The truth here and the faith in the preceding verse prove that those who were dealt with here were not unbelievers. They were those in the church who had turned away from the truth concerning God's economy. It is possible that most of them were Jewish Christians who still held to their Jewish myths and traditions and thereby became a great disturbance to the church. They had to be stopped by the word of the truth according to the faith, that the order in the church might be maintained under the established eldership. ",
  "7050":"This must have been a Christian maxim. The apostle quoted it to refute the commandments of men (v. 14), i.e., the precepts of abstinence, which forbade certain actions and the eating of certain foods (1 Tim. 4:3-5; Rom. 14:20). ",
  "7051":"Or, polluted. ",
  "7052":"The mind is the leading part of our soul, and the conscience is the main part of our spirit. If our mind is polluted, our soul is spontaneously polluted; and if our conscience is defiled, our spirit is unavoidably defiled. This is all due to unbelief. Our faith purifies us (Acts 15:9). ",
  "7053":"Or, confess. ",
  "7054":"Or, reprobate, worthless, disqualified. The Greek word means unable to stand the test. ",
  "7055":"See note 10 in 1 Tim. 1. The healthy teaching is always according to the truth (1:14) of the faith (1:13). It is the content of the apostles' teaching, the content of God's New Testament economy. It not only ministers the life supply to the believers and heals the spiritual diseases, but in so doing it also brings the church into a sound condition with a good order. Hence, it is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church. ",
  "7056":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7057":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "7058":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7059":"See note 13 in ch. 1. ",
  "7060":"Or, deportment, including gesture and habit. ",
  "7061":"The same in Greek as sacred things in 1 Cor. 9:13. See note 1 there. ",
  "7062":"See note 11 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7063":"Compare with addicted in 1 Tim. 3:8. To be enslaved may be worse than to be addicted. ",
  "7064":"Giving good instruction. ",
  "7065":"The Greek word means to cause to be of sober mind, of sound mind; to restore one to one's senses. Hence, it is to train, to develop sound judgment and prudence. ",
  "7066":"Lit., to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children. ",
  "7067":"I.e., kind. ",
  "7068":"The word of God properly and adequately taught in a local church should be testified to by the sisters' submission to their own husbands; otherwise, it may be ill spoken of. ",
  "7069":"Ill spoken of, reproached. ",
  "7070":"The apostle charged Titus to speak things fitting to the healthy teaching (v. 1). Now he charged him further to present himself as a pattern of good works. In his teaching, which had to be healthy, he needed to show three things: (1) incorruption, with nothing corrupted or corrupting but with everything pure, genuine, and sincere in content, presentation, and motive; (2) gravity, dignity worthy of reverence; and (3) healthy speech, discourse given with healthy words (1 Tim. 6:3) to minister healthy things, speech that is not censurable, not reprehensible (v. 8). ",
  "7071":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "7072":"Censured, reprehended. ",
  "7073":"Lit., the one of the opposite, contrary, side; i.e., the heathen or Jewish opposer. ",
  "7074":"The healthy teaching with the healthy speech composed of healthy words is the most effective antidote to the opposer's slanderous speaking. Such light-shedding and life-imparting teaching of the word of the truth always stops the mouth of doctrinal opinion instigated by the old serpent. ",
  "7075":"Not servants but bondslaves bought in the market like oxen and horses. Certainly Paul did not agree with the system of slavery. However, as a teacher appointed by God and as one with spiritual sight, he did not touch the existing social system. To have done so would have given his readers the impression that he was a social reformer, not a teacher of God's economy, and would have obscured his teaching concerning the living out of Christ's divine life in our human living in the midst of any kind of social system. ",
  "7076":"Fidelity, trustworthiness. ",
  "7077":"Or, ornament. The same word is used in 1 Tim. 2:9. The faithfulness of a bondslave can be the ornament that adorns the teachings of God our Savior. The teachings of God could be adorned even through the conduct of bondslaves! ",
  "7078":"Our Savior is not only Christ but the Triune God embodied in Christ, as indicated in v. 13. Our Savior God desires not only to save us but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4). Hence, it mentions here the teachings of our Savior God, which can be beautified, adorned, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace. ",
  "7079":"Verses 11-14 give us a remarkable summary of the economy of God's salvation. The apostle used this as a reason for his exhortations in vv. 1-10. ",
  "7080":"The grace of God is actually God Himself in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment. See note 17 in John 1. This grace plays the most important role in the economy of God's salvation. ",
  "7081":"The eternal grace of God, the saving grace, was destined in Christ to bring to us God's salvation, the complete salvation that comprises forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, and conformation; to redeem us back to God; to impart God's life to us; and to bring us into an organic union with God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. ",
  "7082":"Grace came through Christ (John 1:17). It was given to us in eternity (2 Tim. 1:9), but in the Old Testament it was hidden. In the New Testament it appeared through the first appearing of Christ (2 Tim. 1:10), bringing salvation to all men, both Jews and Gentiles. ",
  "7083":"See note 16 in 2 Tim. 2. ",
  "7084":"Lusts that find their gratification in this world. Ungodliness is the absence of the expression of God; worldly lusts are the expressions of our flesh. Both ungodliness and worldly lusts should be denied that we may live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life. ",
  "7085":"Discreetly, self-restrictingly. Soberly is toward ourselves; righteously, toward others; and godly, toward God. ",
  "7086":"I.e., justly. ",
  "7087":"Awaiting expectantly what is accepted by faith. ",
  "7088":"The blessed hope is the appearing of Christ in His glory. The appearing of Christ will bring us into full sonship, i.e., the redemption of our body, that we may enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God, for which we were saved (Rom. 8:21-25). This is the hope of eternal life (1:2), a hope of eternal blessing, a blessed hope in the eternal life of the Triune God, based on which Paul became an apostle. ",
  "7089":"The glory of the Father (Matt. 16:27), which has been given to the Son (John 17:24) and into which we, as the many sons of God, will be brought (Heb. 2:10). By His wisdom God ordained us before the ages unto this glory (1 Cor. 2:7), and the God of all grace called us and saved us into this eternal glory (1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10). The weight of this glory is exceedingly surpassing and eternal (2 Cor. 4:17), and with this glory we will be glorified (Rom. 8:17, 30). The appearing of this glory of Christ, our great God and Savior, is the blessed hope that we are awaiting. ",
  "7090":"Through the centuries there have been two schools of interpretation regarding this remarkable, marvelous, and excellent sacred and divine title: (1) that two persons are indicated, God and Christ; (2) that there is but one person, Jesus Christ being our great God and Savior, the deity of Christ thus being asserted. We prefer the second interpretation, with a comma after Savior. This corresponds with the two sacred titles revealed at the birth of Christ: Jesus &#151; Jehovah the Savior &#151; and Emmanuel &#151; God with us (Matt. 1:21-23). Our Lord not only is our Savior but also is God, and not merely God but the great God, the God who is great in nature, in glory, in authority, in power, in deed, in love, in grace, and in every divine attribute. In 1 Tim. 2:5 our Lord is revealed as a man; here, as the great God. He is both man and God. His appearing in His divine glory will be not only for saving His people into His eternal kingdom, but also for bringing them into God's eternal glory (Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10). Hence, His appearing in His glory is our blessed hope. ",
  "7091":"On our behalf, not instead of us. ",
  "7092":"Buy with a price (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6). ",
  "7093":"An expression borrowed from the Old Testament (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18), denoting a people possessed by God as His unique, peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9). ",
  "7094":"All the things in vv. 1-14. ",
  "7095":"See notes 13 and 9 in ch. 1. ",
  "7096":"Lit., command. With all authority modifies both exhort and convict. To exhort and convict with all authority is to advise and convict imperatively in every way with words of authority, as if one were giving commands. ",
  "7097":"This exhortation, connected with the matter of authority in the preceding sentence, is the conclusion of all the charges given to Titus in this chapter. It concerns mainly his teaching (vv. 1, 7-8, 15). The healthy teaching with the healthy words according to godliness kept him in gravity, which invites respect and reverence. ",
  "7098":"This is to recognize God's authority and respect His government over men (Rom. 13:1-2). ",
  "7099":"Not quarrelsome; peaceable. ",
  "7100":"See note 3 in 1 Tim. 3. ",
  "7101":"We should remember that in nature we were the same as others, living in the fallen condition; therefore, we should sympathize with their pitiful life and pray for their salvation (1 Tim. 2:1, 4). ",
  "7102":"Or, desires and gratifications. ",
  "7103":"It is the kindness and the love of our Savior God that saved us and made us different from others. ",
  "7104":"I.e., works of righteousness done in the element and sphere of righteousness, denoting genuine works of righteousness. Even such genuine works of righteousness are not sufficient to be the basis and condition of our salvation. Only the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, brought to us by God's mercy, are sufficient to cause us to be saved. ",
  "7105":"Verse 11 of ch. 2 says that the grace of God brings salvation to man, and v. 7 of this chapter says that we are justified by the grace of the Lord. But this verse says that according to His mercy God saved us. God's mercy reaches farther than His grace. Our pitiful condition created a wide gap between us and God's grace. It was God's mercy that bridged this gap and brought us to His salvation of grace. See notes 16 in Heb. 4 and 13 in Matt. 9. ",
  "7106":"Lit., laver; for the washing away of uncleanness. ",
  "7107":"The Greek word for regeneration is different from that for regenerated in 1 Pet. 1:23. The only other place the word is used is Matt. 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium (see note 1 there). Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God's new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new &#151; the divine essence of the new man &#151; into our being. In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation. ",
  "7108":"In 1 Timothy the church is stressed (1 Tim. 3:15-16), in 2 Timothy the Scripture (2 Tim. 3:15-16), and in Titus the Holy Spirit. The church is the house of the living God, expressing God in the flesh, and is the pillar and base of the truth, the divine reality of the great mystery &#151; God manifested in the flesh. The Scripture is the breath of God, containing and conveying His divine essence for our nourishing and equipping to make us perfect and complete for His use. The Holy Spirit is the divine person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature, that we might be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God. ",
  "7109":"The Holy Spirit, who is the Triune God reaching man, has been not only given to us but poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to impart to us all the divine riches in Christ, including God's eternal life and His divine nature, as an eternal portion for us to enjoy. ",
  "7110":"This verse speaks forth the issue and goal of God's salvation (v. 5) and justification (v. 7), which include the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (vv. 5-6). This issue and goal are to make us heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life. ",
  "7111":"The grace of the Savior God, who is mentioned in v. 4 (cf. Rom. 3:24; 5:2, 15). ",
  "7112":"Not merely sons but heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father's estate (Rom. 4:14; 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:7). Such heirs are born (John 1:12-13) of God's eternal life (John 3:16). This eternal life enables them not only to live and enjoy God in this age but also to inherit in the coming age and in eternity all the riches of what God is to them. Hence, there is the hope of eternal life. God's eternal life is our enjoyment today and our hope for tomorrow (see note 2 in ch. 1). According to this hope we become heirs of God to inherit all His riches for eternity. This is the climax, the eternal goal, of His eternal salvation with His eternal life, which has been given to us by grace in Christ. ",
  "7113":"The word in vv. 3-7. ",
  "7114":"The things mentioned in vv. 1-7. ",
  "7115":"Or, consistently, steadfastly, positively affirm (with persistence and thoroughness). The same Greek word is used in 1 Tim. 1:7. See note 2 there. ",
  "7116":"The positive things stressed in vv. 4-8 should be affirmed strongly and consistently, such as our Savior God, Jesus Christ our Savior, the Holy Spirit, God's kindness, love, mercy, grace, and eternal life, with His acts of justifying, saving, washing, regenerating, and renewing. These are the Triune God with His attributes and virtues, plus His divine actions in His eternal salvation; they are things of life, which belong to the tree of life (Gen. 2:9) and produce heirs who will inherit all that God is to them. The negative things dealt with in vv. 9-11 should be avoided, such as foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, contentions about the law, and factious, opinionated men. These are matters of (deadening) knowledge, which belong to the tree of knowledge and kill their victims. The things of life, which belong to the tree of life, should be stressed, whereas the matters of knowledge, which belong to the tree of knowledge, should be avoided. ",
  "7117":"Questions stirred up by genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4). ",
  "7118":"See note 4 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "7119":"Issuing out of the questionings and genealogies. ",
  "7120":"Or, fightings. These are due to different opinions that issue from the deviant and mythological studies of the law. ",

  "7122":"Aimless, without result. ",
  "7123":"A heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions (see note 1 in 2 Pet. 2). The Gnostic Judaism referred to in the preceding verse must be related to this. ",
  "7124":"In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person should be refused, rejected, after a first and second admonition. This is done to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church's profit. ",
  "7125":"Lit., turned out of the way. It is more extreme than being turned away from the right path (1:14). ",
  "7126":"A city in the southwestern corner of Macedonia, where this Epistle was written. See note 6 in 2 Tim. 4. ",
  "7127":"Artemas and Tychicus were intimate fellow workers of Paul; Zenas and Apollos worked independently of him. Yet Paul still charged Titus to care for the latter two, showing that there was no jealousy between the two groups of co-workers. ",
  "7128":"See note 35 in Matt. 22. ",
  "7129":"Referring to subjective faith, the act of our believing, which brings us into an organic union with the Lord (John 3:15; Gal. 3:26) and operates through love (Gal. 5:6). It is in the element and operation of this faith that the saints who were one with the Lord in His concern loved the suffering and faithful apostle. <br><br>   Faith and love are two inseparable, excellent virtues of the believers in Christ. Faith is given to us by God (note 1 in 2 Pet. 1) that by it we may receive Christ (John 1:12), the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), and thereby enter into the Triune God and be joined to Him as one, having Him as our life, life supply, and everything. Love issues out of such a wonderful faith and enables us to live out all the riches of the Triune God in Christ with those who have believed into Christ with us, that the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; may have a glorious expression. Faith is for appreciating, substantiating, and receiving the unlimited riches of the Triune God; love is for experiencing, enjoying, and living out the immeasurably rich Triune God. Faith is for the believers to be joined to the Triune God, who is everything to them; love is for the believers to minister and transmit the Triune God to their fellow believers so that, in such a wonderful and powerful faith, all the believers may love one another with divine, transcendent love and live a corporate life in Christ. In this way the Body of Christ is realized and the processed Triune God is expressed today on the earth in the all-inclusive Christ through the immeasurable life-giving Spirit. <br><br>   The Epistle to Titus is the conclusion of the three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, and it concludes with the wonderful faith and the super-excellent love. This implies that, in the current of the church's degradation, in order to be able to effectively stand firm and overcome the downward trend and factor in the church, this wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are indispensable. We should not walk by sight or care for the outward situation. Rather, in this wonderful faith we should enjoy its source, which is the Triune God, to whom we have been joined through this faith, and by this super-excellent love of the Triune God we should love Him and all those who belong to Him. Only in this way can we become, in the current of the church's degradation, the overcomers whom the Lord is calling and is desiring to obtain in Revelation 2 and 3. <br><br>   This wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are out of the Triune God, who earnestly desires to be joined to us to be our everything. This Triune God passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens on high and was ultimately consummated as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), who includes divinity, humanity, and Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and is the reality of the all-inclusive Christ (John 14:16-20), dwells in our regenerated spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). When we contact this Triune God through prayer and by looking to Him, by means of our spirit, which was once dead and was made alive, He infuses Himself into us in many ways to become the faith within us toward Him and the love outside of us toward those who belong to Him. Such faith and such love are the reality and expression (1 John 4:8, 16) of the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; in whom we believe and whom we worship and receive. Also, they are the rich grace given to us in Christ by the Triune God (1 Tim. 1:14), not only to be the motivating power and expression of our spiritual life but also to become our breastplate (1 Thes. 5:8), which covers and protects the vital parts of our being. It is by such faith that we receive and enjoy the divine life that is revealed and ministered to us in the entire Gospel of John (John 3:16, 36), and it is by such love that we love the Lord and those who belong to Him (John 21:15-17; 13:34-35). Such faith and love are connected and go together: love comes from faith, and faith operates and works through love (Gal. 5:6). Love with faith enables us to love our Lord in incorruptibility so that we may have an overcoming church life (Eph. 6:23-24) for the fulfillment of God's New Testament economy in Christ for the church. Therefore, it is in this faith that we are well pleasing to God (Heb. 11:6) and in this love that we are blessed of the Lord (1 Cor. 16:22). May this love with this faith be to the brothers from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (Eph. 6:23). ",
  "7130":"According to the familial nature of this Epistle, Apphia must have been Philemon's wife, and Archippus, his son. ",
  "7131":"Philemon lived in Colossae (v. 2 cf. Col. 4:17; v. 10 cf. Col. 1:2; 4:9) and according to history was an elder of the church there. It must have been that the church in Colossae met in his house. Hence, it was the church in his house. ",
  "7132":"In the initial stage of the life of a believer, faith comes first, and then, out of faith, love is produced (Gal. 5:6; Eph. 1:15; Col. 1:4; see notes 14 in 1 Tim. 1 and 23 in Eph. 6). But here love is mentioned first and then faith, because the matter of the equal status of the believers, dealt with in this Epistle, is a matter of love, which comes out of faith. In the new man the members love one another in faith (Titus 3:15). Their relationship is of love through faith. The apostle appreciated the fellowship of Philemon's faith (v. 6) and was encouraged by his love (v. 7); thus, he entreated Philemon to receive Onesimus because of this love (v. 9). These two virtues are referred to in combination here; Philemon had both of them, not only toward the Lord but also to all the saints. ",
  "7133":"I.e., full acknowledgment, full appreciation, and full recognition through experience. ",
  "7134":"Not natural things (cf. Rom. 7:18) but spiritual and divinely good things, such as the love and the faith that Philemon had toward the Lord Jesus. These good things are in us, the regenerated believers, but are not in natural men. ",
  "7135":"Some ancient MSS read, us.",
  "7136":"Lit., unto, toward. All the spiritual and divinely good things in us are unto Christ, toward Christ, for Christ. The apostle prayed that the fellowship, the communication, the sharing of Philemon's faith toward all the saints might become effective in them in the element and sphere of the full knowledge, the full realization, of all the good things in us for Christ, causing them to acknowledge, appreciate, and recognize all the spiritual and divinely good things that are in the believers for Christ. ",
  "7137":"For introduces the reason that the apostle prayed for Philemon's faith to become effective in the saints (v. 6), the reason being that Philemon's love had refreshed the inward parts of the saints and, hence, had rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement. ",
  "7138":"Lit., bowels. ",
  "7139":"Soothed, cheered. ",
  "7140":"Or, an ambassador (Eph. 6:20). ",
  "7141":"Prisoner here, fellow prisoner in v. 23, and bonds in v. 13 indicate that this Epistle was written during the apostle's first imprisonment in Rome. See note 6 in 2 Tim. 4. ",
  "7142":"Through the Spirit with the eternal life of God (John 3:3; 1:13). ",
  "7143":"The name in Greek means profitable, useful, helpful; it was a common name for slaves. He was Philemon's purchased bondslave, who, according to Roman law, had no human rights. He ran away from his master, thus committing a crime punishable by death. While he was in prison at Rome with the apostle, he was saved through him. Now the apostle sent him back with this Epistle to his master. ",
  "7144":"Or, unserviceable. Referring to Onesimus's running away from Philemon. ",
  "7145":"Or, serviceable. Because Onesimus had been converted and was willing to return to Philemon. ",
  "7146":"Lit., bowels; as in vv. 7, 20 (inward parts), Phil. 1:8 (inward parts), Phil. 2:1 (tenderheartedness), and Col. 3:12 (inward parts), signifying inward affection, tenderheartedness, compassions. Paul's inward affection and compassions went with Onesimus to Philemon. ",
  "7147":"Just as the Lord would not do anything without our consent. ",
  "7148":"For introduces the reason for the sending in v. 12. ",
  "7149":"Perhaps is not only an expression of humility but also an expression that shows no prejudice. ",
  "7150":"Possess him entirely. ",
  "7151":"This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality, in God's eternal life and divine love, of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul, the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and because they were living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ and in which there was no discrimination between free and bond (Col. 3:10-11). This was based on three facts: (1) Christ's death on the cross abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life, for the creating of the one new man (Eph. 2:15); (2) we all were baptized into Christ and were made one in Him without any differences (Gal. 3:27-28); and (3) in the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God's economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church's decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord's sovereignty that in the arrangement of the New Testament this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books. ",
  "7152":"Or, more than a slave. Onesimus was even more than a free man &#151; he was a beloved brother. ",
  "7153":"A beloved brother here, the sister (v. 2), our beloved and fellow worker (v. 1), our fellow soldier (v. 2), my fellow workers (v. 24), my fellow prisoner (v. 23), and a partner (v. 17) are all intimate terms, indicating the apostle's intimate sentiment concerning his relationship with the members in the new man. ",
  "7154":"I.e., in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother. In the flesh Onesimus was a brother as a slave, and in the Lord he was a slave as a brother. ",
  "7155":"Just as a local church with its elders is in partnership with the Lord, and the Lord entrusts to them the newly saved ones, as the good Samaritan did with the healed one (Luke 10:33-35). ",
  "7156":"This indicates the deep relationship of fellowship in the Lord. ",
  "7157":"This indicates that Onesimus had defrauded his master. ",
  "7158":"In caring for Onesimus, Paul did exactly what the Lord does for us. ",
  "7159":"Just as the Lord pays everything for His redeemed. ",
  "7160":"This indicates that Philemon had been saved through Paul himself. ",
  "7161":"Gk. onaimen, similar in sound to Onesimus (both words meaning profitable). Here, this word is an allusion to the name Onesimus. This is a play on words, implying that since \"you owe me even your own self, you are an Onesimus to me &#151; hence, you should be profitable to me, i.e., should let me have profit from you in the Lord.\" ",
  "7162":"Soothe, cheer. ",
  "7163":"Lit., bowels, as in v. 7. Since Philemon had refreshed the inward parts of the saints, his partner now asked him to do the same for him in the Lord. ",
  "7164":"This expectation, that he would be liberated from his imprisonment and visit the churches again, is expressed also in Phil. 1:25 and 2:24. ",
  "7165":"Paul considered that his visit would be a gracious gift to the church. ",
  "7166":"A contraction of Epaphroditus (Phil. 2:25; 4:18).",
  "7167":"The apostle always greeted the recipients of his Epistles, in both the opening and the conclusion, with the grace of the Lord. This shows that he trusted in the Lord's grace, being confident that this grace would enable them, as well as himself (1 Cor. 15:10), to accomplish what he wrote to them. No human effort avails for the accomplishing of a revelation as high as the completing revelation of the apostle Paul &#151; for this the Lord's grace is needed. ",
  "7168":"See note 18 in Gal. 6. ",
  "7169":"Some ancient MSS add, Amen. ",
  "7170":"God has spoken! Praise Him! Without His speaking, God is mysterious. But He has revealed Himself in His speaking. He is no longer mysterious. Now He is the revealed God. <br><br>   The emphasis of this book is that God, not man, has spoken. Therefore, it does not identify its writer, nor in any of its quotations from the Old Testament does it mention the speaker's name. According to the concept of this book, the entire Scripture is the speaking of God. Hence, in referring to the Old Testament, this book always says that it is the Holy Spirit's speaking (3:7; 9:8; 10:15-17). ",
  "7171":"In the Old Testament, God spoke to the people not once for all and in only one way but in many portions and in many ways: in one portion to the Patriarchs in one way, in another portion through Moses in another way; in one portion through David in one way, in other portions through a number of prophets in several different ways. <br><br>   It is most fitting and meaningful that this book, a book of God's speaking, is entitled The Epistle to the Hebrews. The first Hebrew was Abraham (Gen. 14:13), the father of all those who contact God by faith (Rom. 4:11-12). Therefore, God is called \"the God of the Hebrews\" (Exo. 9:1, 13, ASV). The root of the word Hebrew means to pass over. It can mean specifically to pass over a river, that is, to pass over from this side of the river to the other side, to pass over from one side to another. Therefore, a Hebrew is a river crosser. Abraham was such a one. From Chaldea, the land of idolatry, which was on the other side of the great river Euphrates, he crossed over to Canaan, the land of the worship of God, which was on this side of the Euphrates (Josh. 24:2-3). The intention of God's speaking in this book was that the Jews who believed in the Lord but still lingered in Judaism would leave the law and cross over to grace (4:16; 7:18-19; 12:28; 13:9), that they would leave the old covenant and cross over to the new covenant (8:6-7, 13), and that they would leave the ritualistic service of the Old Testament and cross over to the spiritual reality of the New Testament (8:5; 9:9-14); that is, that they would leave Judaism and cross over to the church (13:13; 10:25), that they would leave the earthly things and cross over to the heavenly things (12:18-24), that they would leave the outer court, where the altar is, and cross over to the Holiest of all, where God is (13:9-10; 10:19-20), that they would leave the soul and cross over to the spirit (4:12), and that they would leave the beginning of truth and life and cross over to the maturity of life in the truth (5:11--6:1). Not only the Jews who believed in the Lord but all who contact God by faith should be such river crossers. This is the purpose of God's speaking in this book. ",
  "7172":"A Hebrew expression indicating the end of the dispensation of the law, when Messiah was to be introduced. See Isa. 2:2; Micah 4:1. ",
  "7173":"In the Old Testament, God spoke in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). In the New Testament, He speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son. The Son is God Himself (v. 8), God expressed. God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed. No one has ever seen God; the Son, as the Word of God (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13) and the speaking of God, has declared Him with a full expression, explanation, and definition of Him (John 1:18). <br><br>   The Son is the center, the focus, of this book. In the Godhead He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance. In creation He is (1) the means through which the universe was made (v. 2); (2) the power that upholds and bears all things (v. 3); and (3) the Heir appointed to inherit all things. In redemption He accomplished the purification of man's sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens (v. 3). <br><br>   This book reveals to us the contrast between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms, of man, earthly, temporary, and by sight and issued in a religion called Judaism. The New Testament is of life, spiritual, heavenly, permanent, and by faith and is focused in a person who is the Son of God. ",
  "7174":"This short recommendation of the Son in vv. 2-3 unfolds to us both the person and work of the Son. In His person He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance. In His work He created the universe and upholds and bears all things, and made purification of our sins. ",
  "7175":"I.e., the legal Heir, inheriting all things in God's economy. Since He is not only the Son of God but also the Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is His possession (John 16:15). In the past the Son was the Creator (vv. 2, 10; John 1:3; Col. 1:16; 1 Cor. 8:6); in the present He is the Upholder of all things and the One who bears all things (v. 3); in the future He will be the Heir, inheriting all things (cf. Rom. 11:36). ",
  "7176":"Lit., ages. The ages is a Jewish expression that means the universe. Ages here does not refer to the matter of time but to creation (the universe) unfolded in time through successive ages. ",
  "7177":"The effulgence of God's glory is like the shining or the brightness of the light of the sun. The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father's glory. This refers to God's glory. The impress of God's substance is like the impress of a seal. The Son is the expression of what God the Father is. This refers to God's substance. ",
  "7178":"The Greek word denotes the instant word. The Son upholds and bears all things not by His work but by His instant word, the word of His power. In creation all things came into being through Him as the Word (John 1:1-3). The universe has been framed by the word of God (11:3): \"He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast\" (Psa. 33:9). In salvation we are saved through His word (John 5:24; Rom. 10:8, 17). It is through His word that His authority with power is exercised (Matt. 8:8-9). It is by His word that His healing power is realized (John 4:50-51). Here, this book says that God speaks in the Son and the Son upholds and bears all things by His word. It is altogether a matter of speaking. When the Lord speaks, everything is in order. ",
  "7179":"In the Old Testament type the propitiation was able only to cover sins (Psa. 32:1); it was unable to take away sins. So the propitiating priests stood daily, offering the same sacrifices (10:11), and could never sit down. But the Son took away sin (John 1:29) and accomplished the purification of sins once for all. So He sat down forever (10:10, 12). ",
  "7180":"This book, having the concept that all positive things are heavenly, points us to the very Christ who is in the heavens. In the Gospels is the Christ who lived on the earth and died on the cross for the accomplishing of redemption. In the Acts is the resurrected and ascended Christ propagated and ministered to men. In Romans is the Christ who is our righteousness for justification and our life for sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and building up. In Galatians is the Christ who enables us to live a life that is versus the law, religion, tradition, and forms. In Philippians is the Christ who is lived out of His members. In Ephesians and Colossians is the Christ who is the life, the content, and the Head of the Body, the church. In 1 and 2 Corinthians is the Christ who is everything in the practical church life. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians is the Christ who is our holiness for His coming back. In 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus is the Christ who is God's economy, enabling us to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. In the Epistles of Peter is the Christ who enables us to take God's governmental dealings administered through sufferings. In the Epistles of John is the Christ who is the life and fellowship of the children of God in God's family. In Revelation is the Christ who is walking among the churches in this age, ruling over the world in the kingdom in the coming age, and expressing God in full glory in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. In this book is the present Christ, who is now in the heavens as our Minister (8:2) and our High Priest (4:14-15; 7:26), ministering to us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and moment-by-moment supply. ",

  "7183":"This more distinguished name is \"the Son,\" a name that is fully defined in the succeeding verses. ",
  "7184":"This day refers to the day of resurrection (Acts 13:33). This chapter gives us an account of Christ from eternity past to eternity future. He was the very God in eternity past (v. 8); He was the Creator of the earth and the heavens (vv. 10, 2); He is the Upholder of all things and the One who bears all things (v. 3); He is the Heir of all things (v. 2); He was incarnated to accomplish redemption by being crucified (v. 3); He was begotten as the Son of God in resurrection for the imparting of life to the many sons of God (v. 5); He is the firstborn Son of God who will come again (v. 6); He will be the King on the throne with the scepter in the kingdom (vv. 8-9); and He will remain forever and ever in eternity future (vv. 11-12). ",
  "7185":"This verse refers to the Son's second coming. In His first coming He was God's only begotten Son (John 1:14). Through the process of resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). Thus, in His second coming He will be the Firstborn. ",
  "7186":"In Greek, the same word as for spirits. Here it denotes winds, to match flame of fire. The angels are like winds and a flame of fire. They are simply creatures, while the Son is the Creator. As creatures, the angels are much inferior to the Son, and as the Creator, the Son is much superior to the angels. ",
  "7187":"O God here and Your God in v. 9 refer to the Son. Since the Son is God Himself, He is God; therefore, here it says, \"O God.\" Since the Son is also man, God is His God; therefore, in v. 9 it says, \"Your God.\" <br><br>   The intention of this book is to show the Hebrew believers that God's salvation is superior to Judaism. In Judaism the boast was in God, angels, Moses, Aaron the high priest, and the Old Testament with its services. Initially, the writer points out that in God's salvation the first superior thing is not only God but God expressed, i.e., God the Son (vv. 2-3, 5, 8-12). Then he goes on to unfold that Christ is superior to angels (1:4--2:18), to Moses (3:1-6), and to Aaron (4:14--7:28) and that the new covenant of life made by Him is superior to the old covenant of letters (8:1--10:18). ",
  "7188":"See note 8. ",
  "7189":"In God's economy Christ is the One appointed by God to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him this anointing for the fulfillment of God's purpose. See note 14 in ch. 3. ",
  "7190":"Since the Son is God (v. 8), He is the eternal Lord, who remains perpetually (v. 11). ",
  "7191":"This book stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do. His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing &#151; for God to set His enemies as a footstool for His feet. He is sitting there in the heavens waiting for a footstool that He may have complete rest. ",
  "7192":"The Son is the appointed Heir of all things (v. 2). We, His believers, are His partners (v. 9). Thus, we are His joint heirs (Rom. 8:17), not only inheriting salvation but also inheriting all things with Him (1 Cor. 3:21-22). Hence, we with Him are joint owners of the universe, while the angels are merely our servants, inferior not only to Him but also to us. <br><br>   The Son was appointed to be the Heir. We are saved to be His joint heirs, sharing in His inheritance. The \"so great a salvation\" mentioned in 2:3 is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into partnership with Him in His appointment. Thus we share in whatever He inherits. <br><br>   As the partners of the Son, we are the house of God, the real Bethel, the gate of heaven, where the Son is the heavenly ladder, joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven to earth. On this ladder the angels of God are ascending and descending (Gen. 28:12, 16-19; John 1:51) as the ministering spirits to serve us, those who inherit so great a salvation. What is spoken of in this book is like the gate of heaven. Here we enjoy Christ as the heavenly One who joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us that we may be a heavenly people, living a heavenly life on earth and inheriting all the heavenly things. How could the Hebrew believers withdraw from this and return to their old religion and boast in the angels? The angels are simply our ministering servants. ",
  "7193":"Along with every major point in this book there is a warning. There are five such warnings in the book. Along with the first major point, that Christ is superior to angels, unfolded in 1:4--2:18, there is the first warning in vv. 1-4. ",
  "7194":"Or, drift by them, drift past them. ",
  "7195":"In principle, to escape here is to escape some recompense, as mentioned in v. 2. If we neglect so great a salvation, it is right and just that we receive a certain recompense. ",
  "7196":"Salvation here refers back to what is mentioned in 1:14. It is God's full salvation, from the forgiveness of sins to the sharing of the coming kingdom with glory. It refers not only to what Christ has done and will do for us but also to Himself, the One who is able to save us to the uttermost (7:25). As the Son of God &#151; as God &#151; and as the Son of Man &#151; as man &#151; He is our salvation. His wonderful person plus His splendid work constitute so great a salvation, a salvation that none of us should neglect. Our negligence will cause us to miss this great salvation's (1) most precious part &#151; the enjoying of Christ as our saving life and rest in this age; and (2) most glorious part &#151; the inheriting of Christ's kingdom with glory in the coming age. These two points are fully developed and dealt with in the succeeding chapters of this book. ",
  "7197":"Distributions of the Holy Spirit, which include the Holy Spirit Himself, are the things that the Holy Spirit distributes to those who receive salvation by believing. ",
  "7198":"I.e., the earth that will become the Lord's kingdom in the next age (Psa. 2:8; Dan. 2:35; Rev. 11:15). ",
  "7199":"The first man, Adam, created by God in Gen. 1, failed to accomplish God's purpose for man. Psalm 8 then alludes, through prophecy, to another man, a man who would replace the first man and would fulfill God's purpose. This chapter tells us that this other man, the second man, who is Jesus, has come and has accomplished so much for the fulfilling of God's desire in man as revealed in Gen. 1:26, 28 and alluded to in Psa. 8:4-8. Hence, in whatever the first man, Adam, failed, the second man, Christ, succeeded, by replacing the first man. <br><br>   This chapter is the fulfillment of the prophecies in Psa. 8 and 22 concerning the major steps taken by Christ, as a man, to fulfill God's purpose. In incarnation He partook of human nature (v. 14). In crucifixion He suffered death for everything (v. 9) and destroyed the devil (v. 14). In resurrection He brought forth many sons of God, His brothers, to form the church (vv. 10-12). In exaltation He was crowned with glory and honor. All these steps are the qualifications that qualify Him to be our High Priest (v. 17). ",
  "7200":"Or, for a little while inferior. So also in v. 9. ",
  "7201":"In eternity Christ was the Creator, unlimited and omnipresent, but when He became a man in time, He was limited so that one day He could go to the cross to deal with the universal problem &#151; death. In order to suffer death and thus destroy and nullify death, Christ had to become a man and lose His freedom temporarily, for thirty-three and a half years. In that sense, He was inferior to the angels during that period. However, three days after His death He resurrected out of that inferiority and is now much superior to all the angels. ",
  "7202":"Glory is the splendor related to Jesus' person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus' worth, value, and dignity, which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7). In 1 Pet. 2:7 the Greek word for preciousness is the same as that for honor here.",
  "7203":"Or, everyone. The Lord Jesus' redemption was accomplished not only for people but for everything created by God. Thus, God can reconcile all things to Himself through Christ (Col. 1:20). This is clearly typified by the redemption accomplished through Noah's ark, in which not only eight persons but all living things created by God were saved (Gen. 7:13-23). ",
  "7204":"Referring to God, who created all things. ",
  "7205":"The many sons here are the many brothers in Rom. 8:29 and the many grains in John 12:24. ",
  "7206":"The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. Romans 8 tells us that God's work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, passed through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification (Rom. 8:29-30). Also, Rom. 8 tells us that the whole creation eagerly awaits the revelation (glorification) of the sons of God, in hope that the creation itself will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:19-21). This will be accomplished by the Lord's coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we will be manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4); this is our hope (Col. 1:27). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God's salvation, will last through the millennial kingdom and will be manifested in full in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23). ",
  "7207":"Or, Captain, Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer. The salvation mentioned in this verse and referred to in v. 3 and 1:14 saves us from our fallen state into glory. Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner (6:20), took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12). He cut the way, and we are now taking the way. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen state but also the Author who, as the Pioneer, entered into glory that we may be brought into the same estate. ",
  "7208":"To make Jesus perfect was to make Him perfect in terms of qualification. It does not imply that there was any imperfection of virtue or attribute in Jesus, but only that the completing of His experience of human sufferings was needed to make Him fit to become the Author, the Leader, of His followers' salvation. <br><br>   As the self-existing and ever-existing God, the Lord Jesus is complete from eternity to eternity. But He needed to be perfected through the processes of incarnation, the partaking of human nature, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, that He might be qualified to be God's Christ and our Savior. ",
  "7209":"He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3) and have the same divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers. ",
  "7210":"Lit., out of. The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all out of one source, one Father. ",
  "7211":"The firstborn Son declared the Father's name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead, when He met with the Father's many sons (John 20:17, 19-23). ",
  "7212":"The church is mentioned only twice in this book, here and in 12:23. Here it is referred to as a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God. ",
  "7213":"This is the firstborn Son's praising of the Father within the Father's many sons in the church meetings. When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising. It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising. In our singing He sings hymns of praise to the Father. If then we do not sing, how can He sing? The more we sing to the Father, the more we enjoy His presence, His moving, His anointing, and His life-imparting within us. Thus we will grow in Him and be brought into His glorification above all. ",
  "7214":"Or, bring to nought, make of none effect, do away with, abolish, annul, discard. After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). In the fullness of the time the Son of God came to become flesh (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3) by being born of a virgin (Gal. 4:4), that He might destroy the devil in man's flesh through His death in the flesh on the cross. (See notes 14 in John 3, 31 in John 12, and 3 in Rom. 8.) This was to abolish Satan, to bring him to nought. Hallelujah, Satan has been abolished and done away with! ",
  "7215":"Since the Lord destroyed the devil, who has the might of death, we who were held in slavery through the fear of death have been released by Him. Death reigned over us (Rom. 5:14), and we were under its slavery, continually fearing death. Since the Lord destroyed the devil and nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10), we now have no more fear of death and are released from its slavery. ",
  "7216":"Jesus has rendered us &#151; human beings, not the angels &#151; help to succor us, to release us from the slavery of death under the devil's might, which is in our nature. He did this by partaking of our nature, in which the devil dwells, and then annulling it on the cross through His all-inclusive death. ",
  "7217":"The Son of God was made like us, His brothers, in that He partook of blood and flesh (v. 14). This was done for two purposes, one negative and the other positive. The negative purpose was to destroy for us the devil, who is in the flesh. The positive purpose is to be our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us in all things. ",
  "7218":"As the High Priest, Christ ministers God Himself and the riches of the divine life to us. As the God-man, He is more than fully qualified to be our High Priest. Here, merciful corresponds with His being a man; faithful corresponds with His being God. ",
  "7219":"Lit., things toward God. ",
  "7220":"Jesus made propitiation for our sins, thereby satisfying the demand of God's righteousness and appeasing the relationship between God and us, that God may be peacefully gracious to us. See note 25 in Rom. 3. Cf. Luke 18:13 and note 1. ",
  "7221":"To be holy is to be separated to God for a definite purpose. (See note 2 in Rom. 1.) Here, by calling the receivers of the book \"holy brothers,\" the writer intended to remind them that they should not remain common in Judaism but should be separated to God for His purpose. ",
  "7222":"See note 14. ",
  "7223":"The concept of this book is focused on the heavenly nature of the positive things. First, it points out to us that Christ today is sitting in the heavens (1:3). He entered into the heavens (9:24). He passed through the heavens (4:14) and became higher than the heavens (7:26). Then this book unfolds to us the heavenly calling (v. 1), the heavenly gift (6:4), the heavenly things (8:5), the heavenly country (11:16), and the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). Also, it tells us that we are enrolled in the heavens (12:23) and that God warns us today from the heavens (12:25). All the things in the Old Testament that were held by Judaism were of an earthly nature. In this book the writer's intention was to show the Hebrew Christians the contrast between the heavenly nature of the New Testament and the earthly nature of the Old Testament that they might forsake the earthly things and attach themselves to the heavenly. ",
  "7224":"The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). The High Priest is the One who went back to God from us and with us (Eph. 2:6). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case may be fully cared for by Him. As the Apostle, He is typified by Moses, who came from God to serve the house of God (vv. 2-6), and as the High Priest, He is typified by Aaron, who went to God with the house of Israel and their cases (4:14--7:28). ",
  "7225":"See note 9 in ch. 2. ",
  "7226":"Moses had the human nature, which is fit for God's building, but he did not have the divine nature, which is suitable for being the builder. In contrast, Christ in His humanity is the good material for God's building (the foundation stone &#151; Isa. 28:16; the cornerstone &#151; Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11; the topstone &#151; Zech. 4:7 (ASV); and the living stone that produces us as living stones &#151; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). Moreover, in His divinity He is the Builder. ",

Today, the house of God is actually the church (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 4:17). The children of Israel, as people of God, are a type of us, the New Testament believers (1 Cor. 9:24--10:11). Their entire history is a prefigure of the church. ",
  "7231":"This word connects the house of God in v. 6 with the Sabbath rest in 4:9, indicating that these two are the same. The house of God is our church life today, our Sabbath rest. ",
  "7232":"Or, err, are deceived. ",

In those three places the meaning is that we share in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the discipline; thus, the word is rendered partakers. Here and in 1:9 the meaning is that we share with Christ; hence, the word is rendered partners. We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline. We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing (1:9), as the members share the Spirit with the Head, and sharing with Him the heavenly rest, as Caleb shared with Joshua the rest of the good land (Num. 14:30).

  "7244":"Joshua, which means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah (Num. 13:16), is a Hebrew name, of which the equivalent in Greek is Jesus. Hence, Joshua was a type of the Lord Jesus, who brought the people of God into rest. ",
  "7245":"This \"another day\" is \"today\" (3:7, 13, 15; 4:7). This is the promised Sabbath rest that remains for us (v. 9). ",
  "7246":"This Sabbath rest is Christ as our rest, typified by the good land of Canaan (Deut. 12:9; Heb. 4:8). Christ is rest to the saints in three stages: (1) in the church age, as the heavenly Christ, the One who rests from His work and sits on the right hand of God in the heavens, He is the rest to us in our spirit (Matt. 11:28-29); (2) in the millennial kingdom, after Satan is removed from this earth (Rev. 20:1-3), Christ with the kingdom will be the rest in a fuller way to the overcoming saints, who will be His co-kings (Rev. 20:4, 6), sharing and enjoying His rest; (3) in the new heaven and new earth, after all the enemies, including death, the last enemy, have been made subject to Him (1 Cor. 15:24-27), Christ, as the all-conquering One, will be the rest in the fullest way to all God's redeemed for eternity. But the Sabbath rest mentioned here and typified by the rest of the good land of Canaan covers only the first two stages of Christ's being our rest; it does not include the third stage. The rest in the first two stages is a prize to His diligent seekers, who not only are redeemed but also have enjoyed Him in a full way, thus becoming the overcomers; whereas the rest in the third stage is not a prize but the full portion allotted to all the redeemed ones. Therefore, in the first two stages, and especially in the second, Christ as our rest is the Sabbath rest mentioned here, the rest that remains for us to seek after and enter into diligently. It is in the second stage of His being our rest that Christ will take possession of the whole earth as His inheritance (Psa. 2:8; Heb. 2:5-6), making it His kingdom for a thousand years (Rev. 11:15). All His overcoming followers who seek and enjoy Him as their rest in the first stage will participate in His reign in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2 Tim. 2:12). Moreover, they will inherit the earth (Matt. 5:5; Psa. 37:11), some having authority over ten cities, some over five (Luke 19:17, 19), and will partake of the joy of their Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23). That will be the kingdom rest, which is typified by the rest of entering into the good land of Canaan. The rest of the good land was the goal of all the children of Israel, who had been redeemed and delivered from Egypt; likewise, the rest of the coming kingdom is the goal of the New Testament believers, who have been redeemed and saved from the world. We are now all on the way toward this goal. <br><br>   God's full salvation, which He intended for the children of Israel, included redemption through the Passover lamb, the exodus from Egypt, feeding on the heavenly manna, having their thirst quenched by the living water from the cleft rock, and partaking of the good land of Canaan. All the children of Israel shared in the Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, and the living water, but only Joshua and Caleb, out of those who shared the exodus from Egypt, entered into the good land and partook of it; all the rest fell in the wilderness (Num. 14:30; 1 Cor. 10:1-11). Though all were redeemed, only the two overcomers, Joshua and Caleb, received the prize of the good land. <br><br>   The Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the good land of Canaan are all types of different aspects of Christ. According to what is depicted by the experiences of the children of Israel, not all believers who have been redeemed through Christ will partake of Christ as a prize, as their rest, their satisfaction, in both the church age and the coming kingdom; only those who, after being redeemed, seek Christ diligently will partake of Him in such a way. This is why the apostle Paul, though fully redeemed, was still pursuing toward the goal that he might gain Christ as the prize (Phil. 3:10-14). In Phil. 3 Paul told us that he had been in Judaism but that for Christ's sake he had given it up (Phil. 3:4-9). Here, in this book, the writer held the same concept, encouraging the Hebrew believers to forsake Judaism and press toward Christ so that they would not miss the prize. ",
  "7247":"Since the rest that is covered in this portion of the word is the all-inclusive Christ, to fall from it is to fall from Christ, to be brought to nought from Christ (Gal. 5:4). In Galatians the danger was that the Galatian believers would drift into the bondage of law from the freedom of grace (Gal. 5:1-4). Paul advised them to stand fast in the freedom of grace, that is, not to be brought to nought from Christ. Here, in this book, the danger was that the Hebrew believers would not forsake their old religion, which was according to the law, and press on into the enjoyment of Christ as their rest. If they continued to stagger in their old religion, i.e., in Judaism, they would come short of Christ, who was their rest. The writer of this book earnestly encouraged them, as Christ's partners, to press on with Christ and enter into the rest, that they, as His partakers, might enjoy Christ as their rest. ",
  "7248":"Lit., in. ",
  "7249":"See note 6. ",
  "7250":"The Greek word denotes the constant word of God. Here it refers to the word in 3:7--4:11 that is quoted from the Old Testament (as indicated by the word for at the beginning of this verse). That word is living, operative, and sharper than a two-edged sword. ",
  "7251":"According to the Bible, man is a tripartite being &#151; spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). Here, in this verse, are the joints and marrow &#151; which are parts of the body &#151; and the soul and spirit. <br><br>   The foregoing verses describe the children of Israel as falling away from entering into the rest of the good land. With them there were three places: (1) Egypt, from which they were delivered; (2) the wilderness, in which they wandered; and (3) Canaan, into which they entered. Their history in these three places signifies the three stages of their participation in God's full salvation. This is a type of us, the New Testament believers, in our participation in the full salvation of God. In the first stage we receive Christ and are redeemed and delivered from the world. In the second stage we become wanderers in following the Lord; our wandering always takes place in our soul. In the third stage we partake of and enjoy Christ in a full way; this is experienced in our spirit. When we pursue the pleasures of material and sinful things, we are in the world, typified by Egypt. When we wander in our soul, we are in the wilderness. When we enjoy Christ in our spirit, we are in Canaan. When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they were always murmuring, reasoning, and chiding. This surely took place in their soul, not in their spirit. But Caleb and Joshua believed in the word of God, obeyed the Lord, and pressed toward the goal. This surely took place not in their soul but in their spirit. At that time the receivers of this book, the Hebrew believers, were wondering what they should do with their old Hebrew religion. This wondering in their mind was a wandering in their soul, not an experience of Christ in their spirit. So the writer of this book said that the word of God, i.e., what was quoted from the Old Testament, could pierce into their wondering like a sharp two-edged sword and divide their soul from their spirit. As the marrow is concealed deep in the joints, so the spirit is deep in the soul. The dividing of the marrow from the joints requires mainly the breaking of the joints. In the same principle, the dividing of the spirit from the soul requires the breaking of the soul. The Hebrew believers' soul, with its wondering mind, its doubting concerning God's way of salvation, and its considering of its own interests, had to be broken by the living, operative, and piercing word of God that their spirit might be divided from their soul. <br><br>   Our soul is our very self (Matt. 16:25; cf. Luke 9:25). In following the Lord we must deny our soul, our very self (Matt. 16:24; Luke 9:23). Our spirit is the deepest part of our being, a spiritual organ with which we contact God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9). It is in our spirit that we are regenerated (John 3:6). It is in our spirit that the Holy Spirit dwells and works (Rom. 8:16). It is in our spirit that we enjoy Christ and His grace (2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 6:18). Hence, the writer of this book advised the Hebrew believers not to stagger in the wandering of their soul, which soul they had to deny, but to press on into their spirit to partake of and enjoy the heavenly Christ that they might participate in the kingdom rest of His reign in the millennium. If they staggered in the wandering of their soul, they would miss God's goal and suffer the loss of the full enjoyment of Christ and the kingdom rest. ",
  "7252":"Our spirit is the organ with which we contact God (John 4:24), while our heart is the organ with which we love God (Mark 12:30). Our spirit contacts, receives, contains, and experiences God. However, this requires that our heart love God first. Our soul is of three parts &#151; mind, will, and emotion; and our spirit too is of three parts &#151; conscience, fellowship, and intuition. Our heart is not separate from our soul and spirit but is a composition of all the parts of our soul, plus the conscience, a part of our spirit. Hence, in our heart is the mind, with the thoughts, and the will, with the intentions. The thoughts affect the intentions, and the intentions carry out the thoughts. The living word of God is able to discern the thoughts in our mind and the intentions in our will. What was quoted from the word of God by the writer in the foregoing verses was able to expose what and where the thoughts and intentions of the Hebrew believers were while they were staggering in the process of their salvation. ",
  "7253":"I.e., excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable. Christ is great in His person (1:5, 8; 2:6), work (1:3; 2:17, 9, 14-15, 10; 3:5-6; 4:8-9; Acts 2:24, 27), and attainment (6:20; 9:24; 2:9). ",
  "7254":"The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation (2:14) to be our Apostle (3:1), our Author, our Leader (2:10), the One superior to Moses (3:3), and our real Joshua (4:8) to bring us, His partners (1:9; 3:14), into glory and rest (2:10; 4:11). He then went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension (5:5-6) to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (2:17-18; 4:15). ",
  "7255":"Having had the principalities and powers stripped off (Col. 2:15), having risen from Hades (Acts 2:24, 27), and having passed through the heavens, our High Priest is now sitting on the throne at the right hand of God. ",
  "7256":"Referring to the faith. ",
  "7257":"Undoubtedly, the throne mentioned here is the throne of God, which is in heaven (Rev. 4:2). The throne of God is the throne of authority toward all the universe (Dan. 7:9; Rev. 5:1). But toward us, the believers, it becomes the throne of grace, signified by the propitiation place (the mercy seat) within the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17, 21). This throne is the throne of both God and the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). How can we come to the throne of God and the Lamb, Christ, in heaven while we still live on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in v. 12. The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (Rom. 8:34) is also now in us (Rom. 8:10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), where the habitation of God is (Eph. 2:22). At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth (Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51). Since today our spirit is the place of God's habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder. ",
  "7258":"Both God's mercy and God's grace are the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, first God's mercy reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace. Luke 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him. That was mercy, which expressed the father's love. Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fattened calf. That was grace, which again manifested the father's love. God's mercy reaches farther and bridges the gap between us and God's grace. <br><br>   God's mercy and grace are always available to us. However, we need to receive and find them by exercising our spirit to come to the throne of grace and contact our High Priest, who is touched with the feeling of all our weaknesses. By this word the writer of this book encouraged the wearied Hebrew believers to receive mercy and find grace for timely help, that they might be set upright (12:12). ",
  "7259":"Gifts are for God's pleasure; sacrifices are for our sins. ",
  "7260":"The Greek here implies a feeling toward the ignorant and erring that is neither too severe nor too tolerant. To exercise compassion is to be moderate or tender in judging their situation. The thought in this verse is a continuation of the thought in 4:15. Though not encompassed with weakness like the high priest taken from among men, Christ as our High Priest was tempted in all respects like us. Hence, being touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, He is able to exercise compassion toward us, the ignorant and erring ones. ",
  "7261":"In this verse the word glorify replaces honor used in the foregoing verse. With the high priest taken from among men, there is only honor, a matter of position. With Christ as the High Priest, there is not only honor but also glory, not only the preciousness of His position but also the splendor of His person. See note 9 in ch. 2. ",
  "7262":"This refers to Christ's resurrection (Acts 13:33), which qualifies Him to be our High Priest. For Christ to be our High Priest, He had to partake of our humanity, as mentioned in 2:14-18, and enter with this humanity into resurrection. In His humanity He can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and be merciful to us (4:15; 2:17). In resurrection, in His divinity He can do everything for us and be faithful to us (7:24-25; 2:17). ",
  "7263":"This refers to the ascension and enthronement of Christ (Psa. 110:1-4), which are in addition to His resurrection and further qualify Him to be our High Priest (7:26). ",
  "7264":"The order of Melchisedec is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood that was only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity. This is fully delineated in ch. 7. ",
  "7265":"Out of death here does not mean that Christ did not enter into death and suffer death. It means that He resurrected out of death. Before He died, Christ prayed for this, and God answered by raising Him from the dead. ",
  "7266":"God ordained that Christ should die, and Christ obeyed (Phil. 2:8). He learned this obedience through the suffering of death. ",
  "7267":"See note 10 in ch. 2. ",
  "7268":"The Greek word implies the thought of author and cause. ",
  "7269":"Not everlasting salvation but eternal salvation, of which all the effects, benefits, and issues are of an eternal nature, transcending the conditions and limitations of time. ",
  "7270":"This word also conveys the sense of designated, hailed. ",
  "7271":"Or, primary elements. ",
  "7272":"I.e., divine utterances. ",
  "7273":"Though this verse mentions teachers and teach, it likens the word of God to milk and solid food, which are for nourishment. This corresponds with the Lord's word in Matt. 4:4 and the prophet's word in Jer. 15:16. Paul and Peter held this same concept concerning the divine word (1 Cor. 3:2; 1 Pet. 2:2). ",
  "7274":"Milk here refers to the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God mentioned in v. 12, whereas the word of righteousness refers to solid food. The good word mentioned in 6:5 is the word of the beginning of Christ (6:1). But the word of righteousness is deeper than the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God's justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. This word is more difficult to discriminate than the word of grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32) and the word of life (Phil. 2:16). ",
  "7275":"Or, senses; implying powers of perception that depend not only on our mental capability but also on our spiritual apprehension. ",
  "7276":"Good and evil here refers to what is superior in contrast to what is inferior, e.g., the superiority of Christ in contrast to the inferiority of the angels, Moses, and Aaron, or the superiority of the new covenant in contrast to the inferiority of the old covenant. According to the context of this verse, the discriminating mentioned here is similar to discriminating between different foods and has nothing to do with the moral nature of things. ",
  "7277":"Or, primary word. The word of the beginning of Christ refers to the six items mentioned in this verse and the next verse, items that constitute the foundation of the Christian life: (1) repentance from dead works, (2) faith in God, (3) the teaching of baptisms, (4) the laying on of hands, (5) the resurrection of the dead, and (6) eternal judgment. These six items form three pairs. The first item of each pair refers to our emergence from a negative situation, and the second speaks of our entering into the positive things. Repentance is a turning away from dead works; faith is the entry into God. Baptisms are separations from and terminations of the negative things; the laying on of hands is the identification and fellowship with the divine things. The resurrection of the dead is the emergence from death; eternal judgment is the entry into eternity and the eternal destiny. ",
  "7278":"The beginning of Christ includes not only the beginning of the believers' experience of Christ, e.g., the six items enumerated in the latter half of this verse and the next verse, but also the early ministry of Christ, i.e., all His work on earth, recorded in the four Gospels. All saved believers have already experienced, as had the Hebrew believers, the beginning of Christ; henceforth they must pursue unto perfection, unto maturity. The Lord intends to complete this perfecting in His later heavenly ministry, as revealed in this book. ",
  "7279":"In the experience of our spiritual life, there is always the Lord's doing, on the one side, and our pursuing in cooperation with Him, on the other side. The Lord wants to bring us on to maturity, but we still need to cooperate with Him by being brought on to perfection, to maturity. <br><br>   The Lord wants to bring us on, but we must let Him do it. This is our willing cooperation with His gracious work. In order to be brought on to perfection, to maturity, we need to share with Christ in His attainments (1:9; 3:14), to be diligent to enter into the remaining Sabbath rest (4:9, 11), to come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace (4:16), and to feed on the solid food to enjoy Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec (5:9-10, 14). ",
  "7280":"Or, perfection. ",
  "7281":"Baptisms, the same word in Greek as for washings in 9:10 and dipping in Mark 7:4, refers to the washing of the utensils and vessels used for God's service in the tabernacle or temple (Lev. 6:28) and also, probably, to the washing of the priests (Exo. 30:18-21; Lev. 16:4). This matter is, of course, related to the background of the Hebrew believers. However, it is the same in principle as the New Testament baptism &#151; both are the washing away and terminating of the negative things. ",
  "7282":"I.e., we will do what is mentioned in v. 1: be brought on to perfection, to maturity, not laying again the foundation. ",
  "7283":"Those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come have already laid the foundation, at the time they believed. If they fall away and turn back, there is no need for them to lay the foundation again (v. 1); there is only the need to go on, to be brought on to perfection, to maturity. There is no need for them to repeat repentance, for it is impossible for them to renew themselves unto repentance. Verse 1 indicates that it is not needed; v. 4 says that it is not possible; and vv. 7-8 show that it is not right. ",
  "7284":"The heavenly gift here refers to God's giving of the heavenly things, such as His forgiveness, righteousness, divine life, peace, and joy, at the time we repented and believed in the Lord. ",
  "7285":"The Holy Spirit is what God in His gospel promised to give man (Gal. 3:14). God called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we might become partakers of His Holy Spirit and share in His Holy Spirit. It is by God's Holy Spirit that we can live a heavenly life on earth and partake of the divine holiness. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we partake of God as our enjoyment. See note 14 in ch. 3. ",
  "7286":"The Greek word denotes the instant word of God. The good word of God here refers to the word of the beginning of Christ, which was mentioned in v. 1 and which was the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord. Now they had to go on to the deeper word, the word of righteousness (5:13), which is concerned not mainly with God's redemption but with the way of His economy, and which was the solid food by which they could reach perfection, maturity (v. 1). ",
  "7287":"Powers here refers to the divine power, and the age to come refers to the age of the coming kingdom. The divine power of the coming kingdom restores, renews, and revives the things that have become old (Matt. 19:28). At the time of their regeneration (Titus 3:5) the believers all tasted this divine power and were restored, renewed, and revived. ",
  "7288":"Fallen away refers to the fact that the Hebrew Christians deviated from the pure Christian faith by returning to their old, traditional, Judaic religion. In principle, this could be applied to any Christians who fall away from the right track of God's way. ",
  "7289":"Crucifying and putting modify the predicate renew. To renew unto repentance means to repeat the repentance that has been made already; this is not needed. To do this is to crucify again the Son of God and put Him to open shame. ",
  "7290":"The rain here refers back to the five categories of good things mentioned in vv. 4-5. ",
  "7291":"Produces vegetation is an illustration of being brought on to perfection, to maturity (v. 1). The believers, as the earth, are tilled for God's sake that they may bring forth Christ, as the vegetation, to perfection, to maturity. By bringing forth Christ they partake of blessing from God. ",
  "7292":"Strictly, the thorns and thistles here refer to the traditional things of the Hebrew believers' old religion. ",
  "7293":"Or, rejected, disqualified, counted worthless. The same word is used in 1 Cor. 9:27. If a believer would not be brought on to perfection, to maturity, but rather falls back to the old things, he will be disapproved, be counted worthless, by God. ",
  "7294":"Once saved, the believers can never be a real curse. However, if they do not go on to grow Christ but rather hold on to things that displease God, they are near the curse of suffering the punishment of God's governmental dealing. (This should be considered with the discipline or chastisement in 12:7-8.) Being near a curse is absolutely different from the suffering of eternal perdition, which is the real curse. ",
  "7295":"The earth could never be burned, but what it brings forth could be burned. The believers could never be burned, but all they bring forth that is not according to God's economy will be burned. The believers are God's cultivated land. Whatever they grow as wood, grass, and stubble will be burned (1 Cor. 3:9, 12). ",
  "7296":"To bring forth thorns and thistles (v. 8) is not a thing that belongs to salvation. To give heed to the things that we have heard (2:1), to be diligent to enter into the promised rest (4:11), to come forward to the throne of grace (4:16), and to be brought on to perfection, to maturity (v. 1) are things that belong to salvation. ",
  "7297":"Salvation here refers to God's full salvation, the \"so great a salvation\" mentioned in 2:3, including the saving mentioned in 7:25, the salvation mentioned in Phil. 1:19 and 2:12, and the salvation of the soul mentioned in 1 Pet. 1:9. To be so saved is to be saved from being near the curse of suffering the punishment of God's governmental dealing, mentioned in v. 8. ",
  "7298":"Referring to the ministering of material things to the needy saints. ",
  "7299":"Or, dull; as in 5:11. ",
  "7300":"These two things are God's promise and oath (v. 17). ",
  "7301":"Lit., fled intensively; implying to flee to a safeguard. Cf. Acts 14:6. ",
  "7302":"The Lord Jesus entered the heavens, the Holy of Holies within the veil, as mentioned in v. 20, and with Him is the heavenly haven for our refuge, which we can now enter in our spirit (10:19). ",
  "7303":"Anchor signifies that we are on a stormy sea and that without the anchor of hope we may shipwreck (1 Tim. 1:19). ",
  "7304":"The heavens, into which the Lord Jesus entered, are today the Holy of Holies within the veil. Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered there, and we may now enter there in our spirit (10:19-20). ",
  "7305":"As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchisedec. As such a Forerunner, He is the Author of our salvation (2:10). As the Forerunner, He cut the way to glory, and as the Author, He entered into glory. ",
  "7306":"According to the work and ministry of Christ, this book has a turn at this verse, a turn from earth to heaven. To the end of ch. 6, what is revealed is mainly Christ's work on earth, typified by the priesthood of Aaron. That section is the word of foundation. From this verse, Christ's ministry in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec is unveiled. This section is the word of perfection, which shows us how the heavenly Christ ministers in the heavenly tabernacle. His purifying of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, while His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (1:3) is according to the order of Melchisedec (Psa. 110:1, 4). His work on the cross on earth, typified by the work of Aaron, affords us forgiveness of sins. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin. His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan. The Hebrew believers participated in His work on the cross. Now they had to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne. ",
  "7307":"Melchisedec means king of righteousness, and king of Salem means king of peace (v. 2). As the King of righteousness (Isa. 32:1), Christ made all things right with God and made all things right with one another. Righteousness issues in peace (Isa. 32:17). As the King of peace (Isa. 9:6), Christ, through righteousness, brings in peace between God and us, and in such a peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood. He is the King who becomes the Priest; thus, His priesthood is kingly, royal (1 Pet. 2:9). ",
  "7308":"At the beginning of this chapter we have the King, and at the end we have the Son of God (v. 28), indicating that Christ as our High Priest is both kingly and divine. His kingship maintains a condition that is full of righteousness and peace that He may minister the processed Triune God to us for our enjoyment; His divinity as the Son of God constitutes Him a High Priest who is living and full of life that He may be able to continue His priesthood perpetually. ",
  "7309":"For all the important persons in Genesis, except Melchisedec, there is a genealogy. In the divine writing, the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of Melchisedec's days or of the end of his life, that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One, as our perpetual High Priest. This corresponds with the presentation of the Son of God in the Gospel of John. Being eternal, the Son of God has no genealogy (John 1:1). But as the Son of Man, Christ does have a genealogy (Matt. 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38). ",
  "7310":"The fact that Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils testifies to the greatness of Melchisedec, who is a type of Christ. Christ, as a Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, is greater than the priests of the tribe of Levi, who offered tithes to Melchisedec through their father Abraham (v. 9), since they were in Abraham's loins when he met Melchisedec (v. 10). ",
  "7311":"The fact that Melchisedec blessed Abraham testifies again that he is greater than Abraham (v. 7). ",
  "7312":"Or, inferior. ",
  "7313":"Or, superior, better. ",
  "7314":"This corresponds with the fact that all the human race sinned in Adam, since all the human race was in the loins of Adam when he sinned (Rom. 5:12). ",
  "7315":"This book is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point concerning this Christ is that He is a Priest not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec. All the other aspects of Christ in the foregoing chapters, such as His being the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Author of salvation, the Apostle, and the real Joshua, are the necessary qualifications for Him to be such a Priest, a Priest who can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost. ",
  "7316":"I.e., transferred from the order of Aaron to the order of Melchisedec (v. 11), from the priestly tribe of Levi to the kingly tribe of Judah (v. 14), and from men to the Son of God (v. 28), who is both the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son. ",
  "7317":"This was a transfer from the law of letters to the law of life, according to which Christ has been appointed a living and perpetual High Priest (v. 16). ",
  "7318":"Lit., has partaken of. ",
  "7319":"The Greek word carries the sense of sprung up, sprouted. ",
  "7320":"In the Old Testament, Levi was the tribe of the priests, and Judah was the tribe of the kings. The Lord descended from the tribe of Judah, causing a transfer in the priesthood and combining in one tribe the priesthood and the kingship (Zech. 6:13), as manifested in Melchisedec, who was both high priest and king (v. 1). ",
  "7321":"Or, indissoluble. Christ was appointed the High Priest not according to the powerless letters of law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life, which nothing can dissolve. This life is endless, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life, and the resurrection life, which passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest. Hence, He is able to save us to the uttermost (v. 25). ",
  "7322":"The commandment, or the regulations, of the law concerning the Levitical priesthood was set aside because it was merely in letters and thus was weak. It was not a matter of life but was a dead commandment in letters; thus, it was unprofitable. ",
  "7323":"Because of the weakness of man, the law perfected nothing (Rom. 8:3). ",
  "7324":"Upon the position occupied by the commandment. ",
  "7325":"This better hope is the priesthood in an indestructible life (v. 16). ",
  "7326":"The Greek word means a guarantee, bondsman, sponsor, and is from the root word meaning a hand into which something is placed as a pledge, implying that the guarantee, the surety, cannot be unbound. Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in that covenant will be fulfilled. That Christ has become the surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest. ",
  "7327":"Or, completely, entirely, perfectly, to the end, and for eternity. ",
  "7328":"Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose. ",
  "7329":"In His ascension Christ passed through the heavens (4:14), so that now He not only is in heaven (9:24) but also is higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens (Eph. 4:10). ",
  "7330":"Perfected means brought to an end by being completed, implying to be made qualified. The Son of God here must be not just the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son, who has been perfected forever through His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Now He is completely perfected, equipped, and qualified to be our divine High Priest. ",
  "7331":"Christ, as the High Priest in the heavens, brings us into heaven, from the earthly outer court into the heavenly Holy of Holies, which is joined to our spirit by Him as the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51). ",
  "7332":"One who ministers as a priest. As a minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, Christ ministers heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here. ",
  "7333":"The Greek word for holy places, used as a noun, is plural here. It refers to all the holy places in the tabernacle; strictly, it refers to the Holy of Holies, the holiest of all the holy places (9:8, 12, 25; 10:19; 13:11). ",
  "7334":"See note 1 in ch. 5. ",
  "7335":"Or, copy, representation. ",
  "7336":"Referring to the ministry of a priest; derived from the same Greek word as minister in v. 2. ",
  "7337":"In His heavenly ministry Christ, as the Mediator, is the Executor of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death. ",
  "7338":"This better covenant not only was enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life (vv. 10-12), but also was consummated with Christ's better sacrifices (9:23), which accomplished for us an eternal redemption (9:12), and the better blood of Christ, which purifies our conscience (9:14). Even more, the High Priest of this better covenant, the eternal Son of the living God, ministers with a more excellent ministry (v. 6) and in the greater and more perfect tabernacle (9:11). ",
  "7339":"Just as the old covenant was the old law enacted by God, so the new covenant is the new law enacted by God, as mentioned in vv. 10-12. ",
  "7340":"The better promises are given in Jer. 31:31-34 and are quoted in vv. 8-12 of this chapter and vv. 16-17 of ch. 10. ",
  "7341":"The first covenant is the old covenant, and the second is the new covenant. ",
  "7342":"Or, space; metaphorically, occasion, condition. ",
  "7343":"In Jer. 31:33, the source of this quotation, the word used is law (singular), whereas in this verse it is laws (plural). This proves that it is one law that spreads to become a number of laws. This one law is the law of life (see the law of the Spirit of life &#151; Rom. 8:2). Every life has a law. The higher the life, the higher is its law. The divine life that we receive of God is the highest life; therefore, it has the highest law, the law referred to here. By imparting His divine life into us, God puts this highest law into our spirit, whence it spreads into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will, and becomes several laws. <br><br>   The law of life differs from the law of letters. The law of life regulates us from within by and according to its life element, whereas the law of letters regulates us from without by and according to its dead letters. The law of dead letters depends on outward teachings, but the law of life depends on the inward consciousness. Since we all, great or small, have the law of life, we do not need outward teachings that are according to the law of letters (v. 11). ",
  "7344":"Here, mind corresponds with inward parts in Jer. 31:33. This proves that the mind is one of the inward parts and that it is the interpretation of the term inward parts. The inward parts consist of not only the mind but also the emotion and the will. These three are components of the heart, mentioned in the succeeding clause. ",
  "7345":"First, God imparts His laws into us; then He inscribes them on us. He does the inscribing while we are experiencing the law of life. ",
  "7346":"Lit., I will be to them for God. ",
  "7347":"Lit., they will be to me for a people. It is according to the law of life that we are a people to God and that He is God to us. God's relationship with us today is based fully on the law of life, so that today we do not need to walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but should walk according to the consciousness of the law of life. ",
  "7348":"In this verse two Greek words are used for know: the first is ginosko, which signifies the outward, objective knowledge; the second is oida, which refers to the inward, subjective consciousness. In John 8:55 the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees that they did not know ( ginosko) God the Father (even in the outward, objective knowledge), and that He did know (oida) the Father (in the inward, subjective consciousness). Both words are used in 1 John 2:29. ",
  "7349":"The word is the root of the Greek word for make propitiation in 2:17. To be propitious is to make propitiation for our sins (see note 17 in ch. 2). In the new covenant four blessings are promised: (1) propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting (forgiveness) of our sins (v. 12); (2) the imparting of the law of life by the imparting of the divine life into us (v. 10a); (3) the privilege of having God as our God and of being His people &#151; the divine life's enabling us to participate in the enjoyment of God in fellowship with Him (v. 10b); and (4) the function of life that enables us to know Him in the inward way of life (v. 11). According to the covenant that God consummated, these four blessings are His promise. But according to the testament that the Lord bequeathed to us, they are His bequests. See note 16 in ch. 9. ",
  "7350":"I.e., the old covenant. So also in 9:1. ",
  "7351":"The same Greek word as for holy places in 8:2. Here, however, it is singular and, hence, is rendered sanctuary. The sanctuary is the entire tabernacle (Exo. 25:8-9), including the first tabernacle, which is called the Holy Place (v. 2), and the second tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies (v. 3). See note 2 in ch. 8. ",
  "7352":"Regarding the place where the incense altar stood, there is apparently a discrepancy between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Exodus 30:6 says that the incense altar was put before the veil, i.e., outside the veil. This indicates clearly that the incense altar was put in the Holy Place, which is outside the veil, not in the Holy of Holies, which is within the veil. But here it says that the Holy of Holies has the incense altar. Therefore, most Christian teachers and Bible readers have thought that some error or misconstruction must somehow have occurred. But this is not so! The apparent discrepancy has great spiritual significance, as shown by the following points: <br><br>   (1) The Old Testament record of the incense altar's location implies the closest relationship between the incense altar and the ark of the testimony, over which was the propitiatory cover, where God met with His people (Exo. 30:6). The record even says that the incense altar was set before the ark of the testimony, with no mention being made of the separating veil that stood between them (Exo. 40:5). <br><br>   (2) First Kings 6:22 (ASV) says that the incense \"altar ... belonged to the oracle.\" The Hebrew word for oracle includes the meaning the speaking place of God. The oracle denotes the Holy of Holies, in which was the ark of the testimony with the propitiatory cover, where God spoke to His people. Thus, the Old Testament indicated beforehand that the incense altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. (Though the incense altar was in the Holy Place, its function was for the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies. On the Day of Propitiation, both the incense altar and the propitiatory cover of the ark of the testimony were sprinkled with the same blood for propitiation &#151; Exo. 30:10; Lev. 16:15-16.) Hence, in Exo. 26:35 only the showbread table and the lampstand are mentioned as being in the Holy Place; the incense altar is not mentioned. <br><br>   (3) The incense altar is related to prayer (Luke 1:10-11), and in this book we are shown that to pray is to enter the Holy of Holies (10:19) and to come to the throne of grace, which is signified by the propitiatory cover over the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies. Our prayer often begins with our mind, which is a part of our soul, signified by the Holy Place. But our prayer always ushers us into our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies. <br><br>   (4) On account of all the above points, the writer of this book had to consider the incense altar as belonging to the Holy of Holies. Verse 4 does not say that a golden altar was in the Holy of Holies, as the lampstand and the table were in the Holy Place (v. 2). It says that the Holy of Holies had a golden altar, because the altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. This concept fits the entire emphasis of the book of Hebrews, i.e., that we should press on from the soul (signified by the Holy Place) to the spirit (signified by the Holy of Holies). <br><br>   The incense altar belongs to the oracle &#151; the speaking place of God, i.e., the Holy of Holies. The incense altar typifies Christ in His resurrection as the sweet and fragrant incense, in which God extends to us His well-pleased acceptance. We pray with such a Christ in order to contact God that God may be pleased to speak to us. We speak to God in our prayer with Christ as the sweet incense, and God speaks to us in the sweet savor of this incense. This is the dialogue in the sweet fellowship between us and God through Christ as the sweet incense. ",
  "7353":"The Greek word here for altar can be translated censer. But here it refers to the incense altar, not the censer; according to the record of the Old Testament, there was no incense censer in the Holy Place or in the Holy of Holies. ",
  "7354":"The arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle portrays our experience of Christ. In the outer court were the bronze altar and the bronze laver (Exo. 40:29-32). This signifies that our experience of Christ begins, in an outward sense, with His redemption, which was accomplished on the cross, and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit, which is based on Christ's redemption. In the Holy Place were the showbread table and the lampstand, with the incense altar located close to the Holy of Holies, in front of the ark of the testimony. The showbread table signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply, and the lampstand, our experience of Christ as the shining light. These experiences are rather inward, in the intellect and consciousness of our being. The incense altar signifies our experience of Christ as the sweet incense ascending to God. This experience is deeper and more inward, leading to the deepest and most inward experiences, in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies was the ark of the testimony, in which were the golden pot containing the hidden manna; Aaron's budding rod; and the tablets of the covenant. The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way, an experience much deeper than that signified by the showbread table in the Holy Place. The budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the incense for our acceptance by God. The tablets of the covenant, which are the tablets of the ten commandments, signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law, which regulates us according to God's divine nature. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the shining lampstand in the Holy Place. All these deepest experiences of Christ take place in our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies. ",

  "7357":"The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant. The veil that closed off the Holy of Holies was rent (Matt. 27:51) by the death of Christ, which crucified the flesh (10:20; Gal. 5:24), and now the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested. Hence, we do not need to remain in the Holy Place, i.e., the old covenant, the soul; we must enter into the Holy of Holies, i.e., the new covenant, the spirit. That is the goal of this book. ",

The time of setting things right occurred at Christ's first coming, when He fulfilled all the shadows of the Old Testament that a new covenant might replace the old. This is a right arrangement, a right ordering. Hence, it is a reformation. This is different from the restoration in Acts 3:21, which will occur at Christ's second coming. ",

  "7363":"Christ accomplished redemption on the cross (Col. 1:20), but it was not until He entered into the heavenly Holy of Holies through the redeeming blood, i.e., when He brought His redeeming blood to offer it before God, that He obtained the redemption that has an eternal effect. ",
  "7364":"In the old covenant the blood of goats and calves only made propitiation for people's sins (Lev. 16:15-18); it never accomplished redemption for their sins, because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins (10:4). In Hebrew the root of the word for propitiation means to cover. Thus, to make propitiation means to cover sins; it does not mean to take away sins. Since Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world (John 1:29) by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins (v. 14; 10:12), His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle (12:24), has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even the redemption of the transgressions under the first (old) covenant (v. 15), transgressions that were only covered by animal blood. Thus, we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19). ",
  "7365":"Lit., made common. ",
  "7366":"The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28), and the new covenant was consummated with it (10:29; Luke 22:20). It accomplished an eternal redemption for us (v. 12; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19) and purchased the church for God (Acts 20:28). It washes us from our sins (1 John 1:7), purifies our conscience (v. 14), sanctifies us (13:12), and speaks something better for us (12:24). By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies (10:19) and overcome Satan the accuser (Rev. 12:10-11). Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls (vv. 12-13). We must value it highly and should not regard it a common thing, like animal blood. If we do, we will suffer God's punishment (10:29-31). ",
  "7367":"On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in the human body (10:5, 10), which was under the limitation of time. But He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity and is not under the limitation of time. Hence, in the eyes of God, Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). His offering of Himself was once for all (7:27), and the redemption consummated through His death is eternal (v. 12), having an eternal effect. The span of His redemption fully covers the span of sin. See note 26 par. 2. ",
  "7368":"The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God. To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience. To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing, anything that is outside God, does not require our conscience to be purified. The conscience is the leading part of our spirit. The living God whom we desire to serve always comes to our spirit (John 4:24) by touching our conscience. He is righteous, holy, and living. Our defiled conscience needs to be purified that we may serve Him in a living way. To worship God in our mind in a religious way does not require this. ",
  "7369":"Since we were dead (Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13), whatever we did, whether bad or good, was dead works before the living God. ",
  "7370":"This book does not teach religion; rather, it reveals the living God (3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22). To touch this living God we need to exercise our spirit (4:12) and have a blood-purified conscience in our spirit. ",
  "7371":"I.e., transgressions reckoned as sins according to the standard of the provisions of the first covenant. ",
  "7372":"The promise of the eternal inheritance is based on Christ's eternal redemption, not on our work, and is different from the promise in 10:36, which is conditioned on our endurance and our doing the will of God. (See note 36 in ch. 10.) The eternal inheritance in the promise here is through the eternal redemption of Christ, whereas the great reward (10:35) in the promise in 10:36 is given by virtue of our endurance and our doing the will of God. ",
  "7373":"See note 34 in ch. 10. ",
  "7374":"In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things that are bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament in which all the things that were accomplished by the death of Christ have been bequeathed to us. First, God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34). Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant (Luke 22:20). Since accomplished facts are promised in this covenant, it is also a testament. This testament, this will, was confirmed and validated by Christ's death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection. The promise of God's covenant is insured by God's faithfulness; God's covenant is guaranteed by God's righteousness; and the testament is enforced by Christ's resurrection power. ",

  "7376":"Lit., over the dead. ",

  "7378":"Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Without forgiveness of sins there is no way for the requirement of God's righteousness to be fulfilled that the covenant may be enacted. But Christ's blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins, and the covenant was enacted with His blood (Matt. 26:28). ",
  "7379":"The tabernacle and all things pertaining to it were sprinkled with and purified by the blood of goats and bulls (vv. 21-23). That was a figure showing that the heavenly things needed to be purified by the blood of better sacrifices, which are the sacrifices of Christ (7:27; 9:14, 28; 10:10, 12, 14). Heaven and all things in heaven were defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fallen angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. So all the heavenly things needed to be purified. Christ accomplished this purification with His own blood when He entered into heaven itself (v. 24). ",
  "7380":"Christ offered Himself as the one sacrifice (v. 14; 10:12). This one sacrifice, viewed from its various aspects, can be considered many sacrifices. As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, and as He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices, which are Himself, are better than the animal sacrifices. Those were shadows that could never remove sins (10:11), but His sacrifices are real and have put away sin once for all (v. 26). Thus He obtained an eternal redemption for us (v. 12). ",

Actually, His being slain occurred once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God, in His first manifestation, for the putting away of sin. See note 14. ",

  "7386":"Since in His first appearing Christ put away sin (v. 26; 1 John 3:5), His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing to do with sin. ",
  "7387":"Salvation here means the redemption of our body and deliverance from the vanity and slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:18-23; Phil. 3:20-21). This is to be glorified (Rom. 8:17, 30). ",
  "7388":"The Old Testament gives us a full record of Christ, either by plain words or by types (Luke 24:27, 44, 46; John 5:39, 46). ",
  "7389":"The will of God here was to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old covenant, that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, might be established. So in vv. 9-10. ",
  "7390":"The first here refers to the sacrifices of the first covenant, the old covenant; the second refers to the sacrifice of the second covenant, the new covenant, which sacrifice is Christ. Christ came into the world that He might, according to the will of God, put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and establish Himself as the sacrifice of the new covenant. ",
  "7391":"The main thought in vv. 1-18 is that Christ has removed sins, accomplishing what all the Levitical sacrifices were unable to do. Having put away sin once for all, Christ has now imparted Himself into us as the divine life so that through the working of this divine life we may become the corporate reproduction of Himself. ",
  "7392":"The priests in the old covenant stood daily and offered the same sacrifices again and again, because what they offered could never remove sins. But Christ put away sin (9:26) by offering Himself to God as the one sacrifice for sins, whereupon He sat down forever on the right hand of God (v. 12). His sitting in heaven is a sign and proof that the removing of sins has been accomplished. His sitting there is forever. Hence, He no longer needs to do anything for sin. He did it once for all. His sitting down forever after having offered one sacrifice for sins is in contrast to the priests' standing daily to offer often the same sacrifices. ",

The secret is our spirit, referred to in 4:12. The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace. See note 16 in ch. 4. ",
  "7397":"Lit., recently opened. ",
  "7398":"This is the second veil (Heb. 9:3) within the tabernacle, which veil typifies the flesh of Christ. When Christ's flesh was crucified, this veil was rent (Matt. 27:51), thus opening the way for us, those who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 3:22-24), to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment. This implies that because our old man was crucified with Christ, we have an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply. ",
  "7399":"Come forward (to the Holy of Holies) is in contrast to shrink back (to Judaism) in vv. 38-39. ",
  "7400":"Both the bodies and the pure water here are figurative, like the spot, the wrinkle, and the water in Eph. 5:26-27. The body refers to our visible outward being, just as the heart refers to our invisible inward being. The pure water refers to the Lord's living word that cleanses our outward conduct and walk (cf. John 15:3). ",
  "7401":"For the Hebrew believers, at their time and in their situation, to abandon their own assembling together would have been to abandon the new covenant way of contacting God, to abandon the church and return to their old religion &#151; Judaism. This would have broken God's administration of grace, thus constituting a serious sin before God (v. 26). ",
  "7402":"Our assembling together as Christians. In those days the Hebrews who believed in the Lord had come out of Judaism and had formerly gone to the gatherings in Judaism. When they believed in Christ and became Christians, they attended Christian gatherings; this equaled their being separated from Judaism. Therefore, if any of them had gone back to the gatherings in Judaism, that would have been equivalent to their being separated from the proper Christian assemblings, which are according to God's New Testament economy. Hence, Paul exhorted them not to abandon their own assembling together as Christians. ",
  "7403":"To sin willfully here means to abandon one's own assembling together with the church. The Hebrew believers had been instructed to abandon Judaism and remain under the new covenant. If they had still returned to Judaism, they would have abandoned their own assembling with the church. This would have constituted a willful sin in the eyes of God, in that it would have been committed after they had received the knowledge of the truth, after they had come to know that God had abandoned Judaism, which was formed according to the old covenant, and had initiated the new and living way of contacting God according to the new covenant. ",
  "7404":"Truth here refers to the things disclosed in the foregoing chapters and verses; those things afforded the Hebrew believers the full knowledge that God had annulled the old covenant and had established the new. ",
  "7405":"If the Hebrew believers had abandoned the church and returned to Judaism, there would have remained no sacrifice for sins in the economy of God, for all the sacrifices of the old covenant had been altogether replaced by the one sacrifice of Christ. Since Christ offered Himself once for all as the sacrifice for our sins (7:27; 10:10, 12), the sacrifice for sins ceased (v. 2). It was taken away by Christ (v. 9), who offered Himself to God as the real sacrifice for our sins. ",
  "7406":"This is different from suffering the second death, which is to perish in the lake of fire for eternity (Rev. 20:6, 14; 21:8). Although believers cannot be lost, they may suffer some dispensational punishment for their failures. This punishment will be worse than that received by those who broke the law of letters. ",
  "7407":"In the new covenant the Son of God replaces all the sacrifices of the old covenant. If the Hebrew believers had returned to Judaism to offer any of the old sacrifices, they would have been, in effect, trampling underfoot the Son of God. ",
  "7408":"If the Hebrew believers had returned to Judaism to offer the old sacrifices and thus rely on the blood of slain animals, they would have been, in effect, considering the precious blood of Christ a common thing. This would have been to seriously disregard the unique redemptive work of Christ. ",
  "7409":"Under the new covenant, through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Hebrew believers became partakers of the Holy Spirit (6:4), the Spirit of grace. If they had returned to Judaism, the Spirit of grace, who dwelled in them and worked in them, would have been insulted by their willful sin. ",
  "7410":"The Greek word conveys no thought of vindictiveness; rather, it implies a full meting out of justice to all parties. ",
  "7411":"A show exposed to the public, a gazingstock. The same thing happened to the apostles (1 Cor. 4:9). ",
  "7412":"This better and abiding possession is the eternal inheritance (9:15) and the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance that is kept in the heavens (1 Pet. 1:4). Under the old covenant the Jewish people inherited earthly things as their possession; but under the new covenant the believers inherit the heavenly riches as their possession. This better and abiding possession was a great incentive to the Hebrew believers to suffer the loss of earthly things. ",
  "7413":"The reward is something in addition to eternal salvation. Eternal salvation is obtained through faith, having nothing to do with our works (Eph. 2:8-9), whereas the reward is given for the work that we do after we are saved (1 Cor. 3:8, 14). We may not receive a reward but may suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work that the Lord approves (1 Cor. 3:15). The reward will be given to us at the Lord's coming back, according to our works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 4:5). What we receive will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and will be enjoyed in the coming kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23). The apostle Paul strived to gain the reward (1 Cor. 9:24-27; Phil. 3:13-14; 2 Tim. 4:7-8). Even Moses looked away to the reward (11:26; see note 3 there). Here the Hebrew believers were charged not to miss the reward &#151; the coming Sabbath rest (4:9), the enjoyment of Christ and the reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom. ",
  "7414":"The will of God here for the Hebrew believers was that they take the new covenant way (vv. 19-23) and remain with the church (v. 25), not shrinking back to Judaism (vv. 38-39) but suffering persecution from Judaism (vv. 32-34). For this they would receive the promise of a great reward (v. 35) at the Lord's coming back (v. 37). ",
  "7415":"The promise here is the promise of the Sabbath rest mentioned in 4:9, a rest in which we will reign with Christ in the coming kingdom. That will be the great reward mentioned in v. 35, which is the gaining of the soul mentioned in v. 39. This promise is conditioned on our endurance and our doing the will of God. It differs from the promise in 9:15. See note 2 there. ",
  "7416":"After this verse and the next, ch. 11 gives a full definition of faith. ",
  "7417":"For the Hebrew believers to shrink back to Judaism was for them to shrink back to ruin, which is not eternal perdition but punishment meted out by the living God (vv. 29-31). See next note. ",
  "7418":"The ruin here is the punishment mentioned in vv. 27-31, which will come upon those who forsake the new covenant and return to Judaism, thus trampling underfoot the Son of God, regarding Christ's precious blood a common thing, like animal blood, and insulting the Spirit of grace. ",
  "7419":"Or, saving, preserving, possessing. Our being is of three parts &#151; spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23), and our soul is different from our spirit. At the time that we believed in the Lord Jesus and were saved, our spirit was regenerated with the Spirit of God (John 3:6). But we must wait until the Lord Jesus comes back for our body to be redeemed, saved, and transfigured (Rom. 8:23-25; Phil. 3:21). Concerning the saving, or gaining, of our soul, it depends on how we deal with our soul in following the Lord after we are saved and regenerated. If we lose our soul now for the Lord's sake, we will save it (Matt. 16:25; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25; 1 Pet. 1:9), and it will be saved, or gained, at the Lord's coming back (v. 37). This gaining of the soul will be the reward (v. 35) of the kingdom to the overcoming followers of the Lord (Matt. 16:22-28). ",
  "7420":"After presenting in the first ten chapters a thorough comparison of Judaism and God's economy, this book charges the Hebrew believers, who were in danger of shrinking back, to live, to walk, to go on, by faith (10:38-39), that is, not by appearance (2 Cor. 5:7). Then, in ch. 11 it goes on to define faith according to the history of faith. Both the eternal inheritance (9:15) and the great reward (10:35) promised by God are things hoped for and things not seen. Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for. Hence, it is the assurance, the confidence, the confirmation, the reality, the essence, the supporting ground, of things hoped for, the foundation that supports the things hoped for. Faith is also the conviction of things not seen. It convinces us of what we do not see. Hence, it is the evidence, the proof, of things not seen. ",
  "7421":"The same Greek word is used for substance in 1:3, assurance in 3:14, and confidence (in which one knows that he has a sure foundation) in 2 Cor. 11:17. Moreover, it can be translated confirmation, reality, essence (which denotes the real nature of things, as opposed to the appearance), foundation, or supporting ground. The word means, primarily, substance, but here it denotes the substantiating of the substance (of the things hoped for); hence, it is translated substantiation. The word substantiate is substance in verb form; to substantiate is to give substance to the reality of the substance not seen. This is the action of faith. Therefore, it says here that faith is the substantiation of things hoped for. ",
  "7422":"The unbelievers, being without Christ, have no hope (Eph. 2:12; 1 Thes. 4:13). But we, the believers in Christ, are a people of hope. The calling that we receive from God brings us hope (Eph. 1:18; 4:4). We have been regenerated unto a living hope (1 Pet. 1:3). Our Christ, who is in us, is the hope of glory (Col. 1:27; 1 Tim. 1:1), which will issue in the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body in glory (Rom. 8:23-25). This is the hope of salvation (1 Thes. 5:8), a blessed hope (Titus 2:13), a good hope (2 Thes. 2:16), the hope of eternal life (Titus 1:2; 3:7); it is also the hope of the glory of God (Rom. 5:2), the hope of the gospel (Col. 1:23), the hope laid up for us in the heavens (Col. 1:5). We should keep this hope always (1 John 3:3) and boast in it (Rom. 5:2). Our God is the God of hope (Rom. 15:13), and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we can have hope (Rom. 15:4) all the time in God (1 Pet. 1:21) and can rejoice in it (Rom. 12:12). This book charges us to hold fast the boast of hope firm to the end (3:6), to show diligence unto the full assurance of our hope until the end (6:11), and to lay hold of the hope set before us (6:18). It also tells us that the new covenant brings in a better hope, through which we draw near to God (7:19). Our life should be a life of hope, which accompanies and abides with faith (1 Pet. 1:21; 1 Cor. 13:13). We should follow Abraham, who beyond hope believed in hope (Rom. 4:18). ",
  "7423":"The conviction of truth. The Greek word can be translated evidence, or proof. ",
  "7424":"All things hoped for are things not seen (Rom. 8:24-25). As people of hope, we should aim our life not at the things that are seen but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are temporary, but the things that are not seen are eternal (2 Cor. 4:18). Hence, we walk by faith, not by appearance (2 Cor. 5:7). ",
  "7425":"From v. 3 this chapter presents to us a brief history of faith &#151; from God's creation, through all the generations of God's chosen people, to the New Testament believers (v. 40) &#151; to prove that faith is the unique pathway by which God's seekers receive His promise and take His way. ",

As the patriarchs waited for this city, so we also seek it (13:14). ",

He left Chaldea, the idolatrous land of curse, crossed the flood, the river Perath, or Euphrates (Josh. 24:2-3), and came to Canaan, the good land of blessing. Yet he did not settle there; rather, he sojourned in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile, an expatriate, longing after a better country, a heavenly one (v. 16), seeking a country of his own (v. 14). This might imply that he was ready to cross another river, from the earthly side to the heavenly side. Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps, living on the earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the God-built city that has the foundations (v. 10). The word in vv. 9-16 may imply that the writer of this book intended to impress on the memory of the believing Hebrews the fact that they, as the real Hebrews, should follow their forefathers, considering themselves strangers and sojourners on the earth and looking forward to the heavenly country, which is better than the earthly one. ",

  "7443":"Christ, as the Angel of the Lord, was always with the children of Israel in their afflictions (Exo. 3:2, 7-9; 14:19; Num. 20:16; Isa. 63:9). Furthermore, the Scripture identifies Him with them (Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15). Hence, the reproach falling on them was considered His reproach, and the reproaches of those who reproached God fell also on Him (Rom. 15:3). The New Testament believers, as His followers, bear His reproach (13:13) and are reproached for His name (1 Pet. 4:14). Moses, choosing to be ill treated with the people of God (v. 25), considered this kind of reproach, the reproach of the Christ of God, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt in Pharaoh's palace; for Moses looked away to the reward.

  "7444":"Because he was willing to suffer the reproach of the Christ, Moses will receive the reward of the kingdom. He was not allowed to enter into the rest of the good land because of his failure at Meribah (Num. 20:12-13; Deut. 4:21-22; 32:50-52), but he will be with Christ in the kingdom (Matt. 16:28--17:3). In referring to this, surely the writer intended to encourage his readers who were suffering persecution for Christ's sake to follow Moses by considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the things they had lost, and by looking away to the reward. See note 35 in ch. 10. ",
  "7445":"Or, was steadfast. ",
  "7446":"Nothing is mentioned here regarding the forty years during which the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, since they did nothing by faith there to please God, but rather provoked God by their unbelief during those years (3:16-18). Even their crossing of the Jordan River is not mentioned here, because that crossing was due to the delay caused by their unbelief. That crossing would not have been needed if they had not had the unbelief that disqualified them from entering the good land at Kadesh-barnea (Deut. 1:19-46) just a short time after they left Mount Sinai (Deut. 1:2). ",
  "7447":"Or, release. The Greek word means redemption (offered at a price). ",
  "7448":"The better resurrection is not only the first resurrection (Rev. 20:4-6), the resurrection of life (John 5:28-29), but also the out-resurrection (Phil. 3:11), the extra-resurrection, the resurrection in which the Lord's overcomers will receive the reward (v. 26) of the kingdom. This is what the apostle Paul sought after. ",
  "7449":"These faith-people are an extra-people, a people on the highest plane, of whom the corrupted world is not worthy. Only the holy city of God, New Jerusalem, is worthy to have them. ",
  "7450":"Or, foreseen. ",
  "7451":"The Greek word means superior, nobler, greater; hence, better. It is used thirteen times in this book: the better Christ (1:4), better things (6:9), a better hope (7:19), a better covenant (twice &#151; 7:22; 8:6), better promises (8:6), better sacrifices (9:23), a better possession (10:34), a better country (11:16), a better resurrection (11:35), something better (11:40), and better speaking (12:24). (The other instance is in 7:7, where it is translated greater.) All these better things are the fulfillment and reality of the things that the Old Testament saints had in types, figures, and shadows. What God provided at that time was a picture of the things concerning us, the things that were to come in the new covenant and that are the true and real things, better, stronger, more powerful, nobler, and greater than their types, figures, and shadows. The Old Testament saints, who had only the shadows, need us for their perfection that they may share with us in the real things of the new covenant. Why, then, should we leave the real things of the new covenant and turn to the shadows of the old covenant? ",
  "7452":"Both the participation in the kingdom for one thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6) and the sharing in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:2-3; 22:1-5) are corporate matters. The kingdom feast will be for the overcomers of both the Old and New Testaments (Matt. 8:11). The blessed New Jerusalem will be composed of both the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers (Rev. 21:12-14). Hence, apart from the New Testament believers, the Old Testament believers cannot obtain what God promised. To obtain and enjoy the good things of God's promise, they need the New Testament believers to perfect them. Now they are waiting for us to go on that they may be made perfect. ",
  "7453":"The cloud is for leading people to follow the Lord (Num. 9:15-22), and the Lord is in the cloud to be with the people (Exo. 13:21-22). ",
  "7454":"In Greek witnesses implies the sense of martyrs. ",
  "7455":"Or, weight, burden, impediment. The runners of the race strip off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, that nothing may impede them from winning the race. ",
  "7456":"Sin here refers mainly to the thing that entangles us and prevents us from running the race, just as the willful sin mentioned in 10:26 would have kept the Hebrew believers away from the new covenant way in God's economy. (See note 26 in ch. 10.) Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin would have frustrated the Hebrew believers and restrained them from running the heavenly race in the new covenant way of following Jesus, who was rejected by Judaism. ",
  "7457":"The Christian life is a race. All the saved Christians must run the race to win the prize (1 Cor. 9:24), not salvation in the common sense (Eph. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:15) but a reward in a special sense (10:35; 1 Cor. 3:14). The apostle Paul ran the race and won the prize (1 Cor. 9:26-27; Phil. 3:13-14; 2 Tim. 4:7-8). ",
  "7458":"The Greek word translated looking away unto denotes looking with undivided attention by turning away from every other object. The Hebrew believers had to look away from all the things in their environment, away from their old religion, Judaism, and its persecution, and away from all earthly things, that they might look unto Jesus, who is now seated on the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens. ",
  "7459":"The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth? ",
  "7460":"Or, Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer, Forerunner. The same Greek word as in 2:10. All the overcoming saints in the Old Testament are only witnesses of faith, whereas Jesus is the Author of faith. He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. In our natural man we have no believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith by which we are saved is the precious faith that we have received from the Lord (2 Pet. 1:1). When we look unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element. Then, spontaneously, a kind of believing arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. This faith is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us. Hence, He Himself is our faith. We live by Him as our faith; i.e., we live by His faith (Gal. 2:20), not by our own. <br><br>   As the Author and the source of faith, Jesus is also the Leader, the Pioneer, and the Forerunner of faith. He cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, took the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He can carry us in His footsteps through the pathway of faith. As we look to Him as the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and as the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne in heaven, He transfuses and even infuses us with the faith that He originated and perfected. ",
  "7461":"Or, Finisher, Completer. Jesus is also the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. He will finish what He originated. He will complete what He inaugurated. If we look to Him continually, He will finish and complete the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race. ",
  "7462":"From 1:3 this book points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. In all his other Epistles Paul presents to us mainly the Christ who dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:10; 2 Tim. 4:22) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to be our life and our everything. But in this book he points us particularly to the Christ who has sat down in heaven and who is of so many aspects, that He may care for us in every way. In Paul's other Epistles the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book the heavenly Christ is contrasted to the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ, we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ, we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him, who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. By His death and resurrection He accomplished everything that is needed by both God and man. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the person of the Son of God (1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), in the person of God (1:8) and man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the anointed One of God (1:9), the Author of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (2:11), the constant Succor (2:16), the instant Helper (4:16), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister of the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (8:6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (v. 2), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we look to Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will minister heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth. In this way He will carry us through all the lifelong pathway and lead and bring us into glory (2:10). ",
  "7463":"Lit., becoming loosened. ",
  "7464":"Sin here must refer to something evil in the sight of God that frustrates the believers and holds them back from the new covenant way, for it needs to be resisted, even unto blood. ",
  "7465":"Or, chastening. So in vv. 7, 8, and 11. ",
  "7466":"Or, chastens. So in vv. 7 and 10. ",
  "7467":"From the viewpoint of God, the persecution from Judaism that the Hebrew believers suffered was a discipline, a chastening. ",
  "7468":"Or, chasteners. ",
  "7469":"Father of spirits is contrasted with fathers of our flesh. In regeneration we are born of God (John 1:13) in our spirit (John 3:6). Hence, God is the Father of (our) spirits. ",
  "7470":"Holiness is God's nature. To partake of God's holiness is to partake of His holy nature. It was common, unholy, for the Hebrew believers to remain in Judaism. They needed to be sanctified unto God's new covenant so that they could partake of God's holy nature. For that purpose, persecution was aroused to discipline them that they might be sanctified from the common. ",
  "7471":"Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Isa. 32:17). Holiness is the inward nature, whereas righteousness is the outward behavior. God's discipline helps the believers not only to partake of His holiness but also to be right with both God and man, that in such a situation of righteousness they may enjoy peace as a sweet fruit, a peaceable fruit of righteousness. ",
  "7472":"Lit., set upright. ",
  "7473":"The Christian life is not a matter of theoretical doctrines for the mind to think about. It must consist of practical paths for our feet to walk on. All the sound, healthy doctrines in the Bible are paths that can be walked on. This is especially true with the book of Hebrews. First, this book ministers to us the highest and healthiest doctrines concerning Christ and His new covenant. Then, based on the proper doctrines that it shows us, it charges us to run the race and make straight paths for our feet. The first section of this book (1:1--10:18) deals with doctrines, and the second (10:19--13:25) deals with the race and the paths. ",
  "7474":"Or, dislocated, wrenched. An alternate meaning, turned aside, as in 1 Tim. 1:6; 5:15; and 2 Tim. 4:4, does not match the antithesis that follows, \"but rather may be healed,\" nor does it fit the context like the first meaning. The implication of the context is that the staggering Hebrew believers should abandon all appearance of the practices of Judaism (i.e., make straight paths) that they, the lame members (limbs) of the Body, might not fall into apostasy (i.e., not be put out of joint) but rather be brought fully into the new covenant way (i.e., be healed). ",
  "7475":"With God, holiness is His holy nature; with us, holiness is our sanctification, our being separated unto God. (See note 2 in Rom. 1.) The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must pay attention to the matter of sanctification before God. Our pursuing of peace with all men must be balanced by our sanctification before God, our being separated unto God, without which no one will see the Lord and have fellowship with Him. ",
  "7476":"The grace of God came to us through Christ (John 1:14, 17). Hence, it is also the grace of Christ (2 Cor. 13:14; 12:9). In our experience this grace is just Christ Himself (Gal. 6:18, cf. 2 Tim. 4:22). When we fall from grace we are brought to nought, separated from Christ (Gal. 5:4). Regarding this matter, Paul warned the churches of Galatia, which were in the same danger as the Hebrew believers, not to be separated from Christ by being turned aside to the law of the Jewish religion, lest they fall away from the grace of God, which is Christ Himself. We should not fall away from grace but should have grace (v. 28), be confirmed by grace (13:9), and stand in grace (Rom. 5:2). Both Galatians and Hebrews close with the blessing of grace (Gal. 6:18; Heb. 13:25). ",
  "7477":"According to the implication of the context, the root of bitterness must be a Judaizer who would have caused the Hebrew believers to be turned aside from the grace of God to the rituals of Judaism and thus to defile themselves in the sight of God, neglecting the holiness of God. ",
  "7478":"Esau's birthright as the firstborn son of Isaac was the double portion of land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Because of Esau's profaneness in giving up his birthright, the double portion of land was given to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1-2), the priesthood was passed to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10), and the kingship was assigned to Judah (Gen. 49:10; 1 Chron. 5:2). <br><br>   We Christians, born of God, are the firstfruits of His creatures (James 1:18) that He has reaped in His creation. In that sense we are the firstborn sons of God. Hence, the church, composed of us, is called the church of the firstborn (v. 23). As the firstborn sons of God, we have the birthright. This includes the inheritance of the earth (2:5-6), the priesthood (Rev. 20:6), and the kingship (Rev. 20:4), which will be the main blessings in the coming kingdom and which the profane, world-loving-and-seeking Christians will lose at the Lord's coming back. Eventually, this birthright will be a reward given to the overcoming Christians in the millennial kingdom. Any worldly enjoyment, even one meal, could cause us to forfeit this birthright of ours. After such a serious warning, if the Hebrew believers had still preferred to indulge in \"one meal\" of their old religion, they would have missed the full enjoyment of Christ and would have lost the kingdom rest with all its blessings. <br><br>   Esau was not the only one who lost his birthright (Gen. 25:29-34); Reuben was another who lost the blessing of the birthright (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1). Esau lost it because of his lust in eating. Reuben lost it because of the defilement of his lust. Both cases should be warnings to us. The word lest there be any fornicator in this verse might have been written with Reuben as the background. <br><br>   Actually, what we are privileged to enjoy in Christ is the foretaste of the blessings in the coming kingdom. The proper enjoyment of this foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the kingdom blessings. If we do not enjoy Christ today as our good land, as defined in note 9 of ch. 4, how can we enter into His rest in the kingdom and inherit the earth with Him? If we do not exercise our priesthood today to contact Him and prayerfully minister to Him, how can we fulfill our priestly duty in the kingdom? If we do not exercise our spirit with the God-given authority to rule our self, our flesh, our entire being, and the enemy with all his power of darkness today, how can we be Christ's co-kings and rule the nations with Him in His kingdom (Rev. 2:26-27)? Our enjoyment of Christ and the practice of the priesthood and kingship today are the preparation and qualification for our participating in Christ's kingdom tomorrow! ",
  "7479":"No place for repentance does not mean that Esau had no ground to repent; it means that he had no ground, no way, to reverse by repentance the result of what he had done. ",
  "7480":"The things mentioned in vv. 18-19 are earthly and physical, signifying the side of the law, where everyone, including Moses, was in fear and trembling (vv. 19-21). ",
  "7481":"The things mentioned in vv. 22-24 are heavenly and spiritual, in contrast to the earthly and physical things listed in vv. 18-19. These things signify the side of grace, where both the firstborn and the spirits of righteous men are saved by grace. The people under the old covenant came to the side of the law, whereas we Christians, who are under the new covenant, come to the side of grace. Hence, we are not under the law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). This portion of the word (vv. 18-24), like Gal. 4:21-31, shows us that we are not under the bondage of the law but under the freedom of grace to be the heirs of the inheritance. This is our birthright! We should not give this up by falling away from grace (v. 15), but should have grace (v. 28). The things on the side of grace are heavenly, but not all are in heaven yet. A great number of the firstborn of the church are still on earth, while the spirits of righteous men, who are the Old Testament saints, are in Paradise, where Abraham is (Luke 16:22-23, 25-26) and where the Lord Jesus and the saved robber went after they died on the cross (Luke 23:43). <br><br>   None of the six items listed on the side of the law is pleasant. First, there is a mountain set on fire. Who would approach such a place? Then there are the darkness, the gloom, and the stormy whirlwind. Last, there are the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the solemn, warning voice of words. All these present a fearsome sight. On the side of grace, however, everything is pleasant. The eight items here can be considered four pairs. The elevated Mount Zion and the beautiful heavenly Jerusalem are the first pair, denoting God's habitation and the center of His universal administration. What a lovely place! The celebrating, jubilant angels, so closely related to the heirs of salvation to whom they minister (1:14), and the blessed firstborn of the church form the second pair in the scene. What a joyful demonstration of an angelic gathering! They celebrate the participation by the human heirs of salvation, the church of the firstborn, in the blessings of the new covenant. God, the Judge of all, and the spirits of righteous men, the Old Testament saints (their bodies, not resurrected, were not worthy to be listed in this portion) are linked as the third pair, showing that God, being righteous, justifies the righteous saints of old because of their faith. The dear Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, which is a better covenant, and His precious sprinkled blood, which speaks something better, compose the last pair, indicating that a better covenant was enacted with Jesus' better blood, that Jesus died and bequeathed this new covenant as a new testament to His believers, and that He is now the Mediator, the Executor, of this new testament, bringing about the full realization of all the blessed facts contained within it. What a pleasant scene! What a contrast to the scene on the side of the law, where no God, no Savior, and even no angels are mentioned! It is no wonder that not one saved person is seen there. In the scene of grace there is the justifying God, the Savior, who is the Mediator of His new testament, with His speaking blood, the ministering angels with the assembly (the church) of the saved ones, and the spirits of the justified saints. On the side of the law the scene ends with the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the warning words. On the side of grace the scene ends with a sympathizing Mediator and a vindicating speaking. After seeing such a contrast, who would be so foolish as to leave the side of grace and turn to the side of the law? All eight items on the side of grace are not only heavenly and spiritual but also eternal. Hence, even when heaven is shaken (v. 26), these eight items that are eternal will still remain (v. 27). ",
  "7482":"See note 10 in ch. 11. ",
  "7483":"Or, festal gathering. The Greek word means universal gathering, whole or full assembly, and is used to denote a group of people gathered to celebrate a public festival, such as the Olympic games. The entire new covenant age is a festival, and the myriads of angels, who are the ministering spirits rendering service to the heirs of salvation (1:14) under the new covenant, are a universal gathering celebrating the marvelous festival of \"so great a salvation\" (2:3), the greatest and most exciting \"game\" in the universe! The Lord's word in Luke 15:7, 10, and 1 Pet. 1:12 may indicate this. ",
  "7484":"See note 16 par. 2. ",
  "7485":"Though the firstborn of the church are not yet in heaven, they are enrolled in the heavens. ",
  "7486":"The Greek word for new here means fresh, youthful, with respect to age, while the word for new in 8:8, 13, and 9:15 means new, fresh, with respect to quality. ",
  "7487":"In this book the blood of Christ is particularly prominent and crucial. It is the blood of the eternal covenant (13:20), with which the new and better covenant was enacted (10:29). Through this blood Christ entered once for all into the Holy of Holies and obtained an eternal redemption for us (9:12). By this blood Christ cleansed the heavens and all things in the heavens (9:22-24). This blood sanctifies us (13:12; 10:29), purifies our conscience to serve the living God (9:14), and speaks something better for us than the blood of Abel (v. 24). It is in this blood that we have boldness for entering the Holy of Holies (10:19). We should not regard this blood common, like animal blood; if we do, we will suffer God's punishment (10:29). ",
  "7488":"The blood of Christ not only redeems, sanctifies, and purifies; it also speaks. It is the speaking blood, speaking something better than the blood of Abel. Abel's blood speaks to God for accusation and vengeance (Gen. 4:10-15), whereas Christ's blood speaks to God for forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, and redemption. Moreover, this precious blood speaks to God on our behalf, saying that by the blood (as unveiled in this book) the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ who receive this covenant out of faith. ",
  "7489":"The gospel that the New Testament has preached to us is the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 3:1-2; 4:17, 23; 10:7; 24:14). We were regenerated into the kingdom (John 3:5) and were transferred into the kingdom (Col. 1:13). Now we are in the kingdom (Rev. 1:9), which today is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17). However, what we are in now and what is in the church today is the kingdom in its reality, whereas what will come with Christ's return in the future will be the kingdom in its manifestation. <br><br>   The kingdom in its reality, or the reality of the kingdom, is an exercise and a discipline to us (Matt. 5:3, 10, 20; 7:21) in the church today whereas the kingdom in its manifestation, or the manifestation of the kingdom, will be a reward and an enjoyment to us (Matt. 16:27; 25:21, 23) in the millennial kingdom in the coming age. If we take the Spirit's exercise and God's discipline in the reality of the kingdom today, we will receive the Lord's reward and enter into the enjoyment of the coming Sabbath rest (4:9) in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age; otherwise, we will miss the coming kingdom, we will not be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom at the Lord's coming back, we will have no right to enter into the glory of the kingdom to participate in Christ's reign in the millennial kingdom, and we will lose our birthright and therefore will be unable to inherit the earth in the coming age, to be the royal priests serving God and Christ in His manifested glory, and to be Christ's co-kings ruling all the nations with His divine authority (Rev. 20:4, 6). To miss the coming kingdom and to forfeit our birthright does not mean that we will perish. It means that we will lose the reward but not our salvation. (See note 35 in ch. 10.) We will suffer loss but still will be saved, yet so as through fire (1 Cor. 3:14-15). This is the basic concept on which all five warnings in this book are given and with which they are all pervaded. All the negative points of these warnings are related to the suffering of the loss of the reward in the coming kingdom, whereas all the positive points are related to the reward and enjoyment of the kingdom. All seven epistles in Rev. 2 and 3 conclude with this same concept &#151; the reward of the kingdom or the loss of it. Only in light of this concept can we rightly understand and properly apply the word in Matt. 5:20; 7:21-23; 16:24-27; 19:23-30; 24:46-51; 25:11-13, 21, 23, 26-30; Luke 12:42-48; 19:17, 19, 22-27; Rom. 14:10, 12; 1 Cor. 3:8, 13-15; 4:5; 9:24-27; 2 Cor. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:7-8; Heb. 2:3; 4:1, 9, 11; 6:4-8; 10:26-31, 35-39; 12:16-17, 28-29; and Rev. 2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-27; 3:4-5, 11-12, 20; 22:12. If we do not have this concept, the interpretation of these verses falls into either the extreme objectiveness of the Calvinist school or the extreme subjectiveness of the Arminian school. Neither of these schools recognizes the reward of the kingdom; even more, they do not see the suffering of the loss of the kingdom reward. Hence, both consider all the negative points in these verses as referring to perdition. The Calvinist school, believing in eternal salvation (i.e., that once a person is saved, he will never perish), regards all these negative points as applying to the perdition of false believers; while the Arminian school, believing that a saved person will perish if he falls, regards these points as applying to the perdition of believers who have fallen. But the complete revelation of the Bible shows that these negative points refer to the suffering of the loss of the kingdom reward. God's salvation is eternal; once we obtain it, we will never lose it (John 10:28-29). But we may suffer the loss of the kingdom reward, even though we still will be saved (1 Cor. 3:8, 14-15). The warnings in Hebrews do not refer to the loss of eternal salvation but to the loss of the kingdom reward. The Hebrew believers had received the kingdom, but they risked losing the reward in the manifestation of the kingdom if they shrank back from the grace of God, from God's new covenant way. This was the writer's main concern in warning the staggering Hebrew believers. ",
  "7490":"Or, take. To have grace, especially for the Hebrew believers, was to remain in the new covenant to enjoy Christ. ",
  "7491":"God is holy; holiness is His nature. Whatever does not correspond with His holy nature, He, as the consuming fire, will consume. If the Hebrew believers had turned aside to Judaism, which was common (unholy) in the sight of God, they would have become unholy, and the holy God as the consuming fire would consume them. God is not only righteous but also holy. To satisfy God's righteousness we need to be justified through the redemption of Christ. To meet the demands of His holiness we need to be sanctified, to be made holy by the heavenly, present, and living Christ. Romans stresses more the matter of justification (Rom. 3:24) for God's righteousness (Rom. 3:25-26), whereas Hebrews emphasizes more the matter of sanctification (2:11; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12) for God's holiness (v. 14). For their sanctification, it was necessary that the Hebrew believers separate themselves from the unholy Judaism unto the holy God, who has fully expressed Himself in the Son under the new covenant; otherwise, they would have defiled themselves with their old, profane religion and would be dealt with by the holy God as the consuming fire. That would be fearsome (10:31)! It is no wonder that Paul was very concerned about the fear of the Lord (2 Cor. 5:11). ",
  "7492":"As indicated by its content, this chapter was written with a view to a proper church life. Nearly everything mentioned here, such as brotherly love and hospitality, is for the church life, not only for the Christian life. ",
  "7493":"Or, remain. ",
  "7494":"This is to suffer with the suffering members of the Body of Christ, the church (1 Cor. 12:26). ",
  "7495":"In the church life, contact between brothers and sisters is unavoidable. Hence, to be protected from falling into defilement, we must hold marriage in honor and not behave loosely. This is a matter that seriously affects our birthright in God's economy. Reuben lost the birthright because of his defilement (Gen. 49:3-4; 1 Chron. 5:1), and Joseph received it because of his purity (1 Chron. 5:1; Gen. 39:7-12; see note 16 in ch. 12). God will judge fornicators and adulterers, and the church too must judge them (1 Cor. 5:1-2, 11-13). Nothing damages the saints and the church life as much as this defilement. ",
  "7496":"Or, in every way. ",
  "7497":"This book concerns God's holiness. The holy God will not tolerate any defilement among us. He will judge His people (10:30; 12:23). ",
  "7498":"Surely money lovers cannot enter into the reality of the church life. We should always be satisfied with what we have so that we cannot be distracted from the church life by mammon. Since we have the Lord as our Helper, we should be content and at peace that we may be kept fully in the enjoyment of the church life. ",
  "7499":"This is essential in the church life. The ministers of the word of God should have a manner of life that issues in an example of faith for the church members, the receivers of the word of God, to imitate. Then the church members not only will receive the word that the ministers minister but also will imitate the ministers' faith, which is expressed in their manner of life. <br><br>   Verse 7 is a continuation of vv. 5-6. Manner of life must refer to the living and behavior pursued by those ministers of the word of God, in which they had no love of money and were satisfied with what they had (v. 5a). Their faith must refer to the fact that they trusted in the Lord, their Helper, for their living (vv. 5b-6). The word that they ministered and the life that they lived must have been entirely Christ, and their faith must have been the faith in Christ, of which Christ is both the Author and the Perfecter (12:2). Such a manner of life and such a faith were surely worthy to be imitated by the believers, who received the word of God that the ministers ministered and who considered the issue of their manner of life. ",
  "7500":"Christ, who is the word that the ministers of the word of God in v. 7 preached and taught, who is the life that they lived, and who is the Author and Perfecter of their faith, is perpetual, unchangeable, and unchanging. He remains the same forever (1:11-12). There must not be another Jesus and another gospel preached in the church (2 Cor. 11:4; Gal. 1:8-9). For a true and steadfast church life, we must hold on to the Christ who is the same yesterday and today, and even forever, and must not be carried away by various strange teachings (v. 9). ",
  "7501":"Various strange teachings are always used by Satan to cause dissension and even division in the church. Because of this, the apostle charged people not to teach different things (1 Tim. 1:3). The various strange teachings must have been taught at that time by the Judaizers. The writer warned the Hebrew believers not to let the teachings of the Judaizers carry them away from the church life under the new covenant. ",
  "7502":"At that time, to be confirmed by grace was to remain in the new covenant to enjoy Christ as grace (Gal. 5:4) and not to be carried away back to Judaism to participate in the eating of food (sacrifices) in the Jews' religious ceremonies. ",
  "7503":"The food mentioned here, being in contrast to grace, is the food used in the ceremonial observances of the old covenant (9:10; Col. 2:16). The Judaizers attempted to use such food to carry away the Hebrew believers from the enjoyment of grace, which is the participation in Christ in the new covenant. ",
  "7504":"This altar must be the cross on which the Lord Jesus offered Himself as the sacrifice for our sins (10:12). According to the regulations concerning the offerings in the Old Testament, the sacrifice for sin, or the sin offering, the blood of which was brought into the Holy of Holies or the Holy Place for propitiation, afforded the offering priest or the offerer nothing to eat; the entire offering had to be burned up (Lev. 4:2-12; 16:27; 6:30). Hence, those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat from the altar of the sin offering (which in the New Testament fulfillment is the Lord's cross). Verse 10 is a strong argument against the Judaizers' using of food in their strange teachings to attempt to carry away the new covenant believers from the enjoyment of Christ. The Judaizers' emphasis was on the food that they enjoyed in their religious services. But the writer of this book argued that in the sin offering, the basic offering for yearly propitiation (Lev. 16), there was nothing for anyone to eat. With the sin offering, it is not a matter of eating it but a matter of receiving its efficacy. Now the real sin offering is Christ, who offered Himself to God for our sin and accomplished full redemption (better than propitiation &#151; see note 12 in ch. 9) for us that we may be brought into the enjoyment of God's grace in Him under the new covenant. What we need today is not to eat the food of the old covenant services but to receive the efficacy of Christ's offering and follow Him in the new covenant grace outside the camp, outside the Jewish religion. ",
  "7505":"The blood of the sin offering being brought into the Holy of Holies on the day of propitiation to make propitiation for the people and the bodies of the animals being burned up outside the camp (Lev. 16:14-16, 27) typify the blood of Christ, who is the real sin offering, being brought into the true Holy of Holies to accomplish redemption for us and the body of Christ being sacrificed for us outside the gate of the city of Jerusalem (v. 12). ",
  "7506":"This book unveils to us that God's heavenly calling is to make us a holy people (3:1), a people sanctified unto God. Christ is the Sanctifier (2:11). He suffered death on the cross, shedding His blood, and entered the Holy of Holies with His blood (9:12) that by the heavenly ministry (8:2, 6) of His heavenly priesthood (7:26) He might be able to do the sanctifying work, and that we might enter within the veil by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier. By participating in Him in this way, we are enabled to follow Him outside the camp by the sanctifying pathway of the cross. See notes 12 and 13. ",
  "7507":"The Lord's blood, through which He entered into the Holy of Holies (9:12), opened the new and living way, enabling us to enter within the veil to enjoy Him in the heavens as the glorified One (10:19-20); and His body, which was sacrificed for us on the cross, cut the narrow way of the cross, enabling us to go outside the camp to follow Him on earth as the suffering One (v. 13). ",
  "7508":"This is the gate of the city of Jerusalem. The city signifies the earthly realm, while the camp signifies human organization. Together, the two signify one thing, the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human. Judaism is both earthly and human. ",
  "7509":"Outside the camp and within the veil (6:19) are two very striking points in this book. To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp means to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast in rejection. This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where experientially the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today. The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will come outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus. Being in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus. The more we remain in our spirit to contact the heavenly Christ, who is in glory, the more we will go forth outside the camp of religion unto the lowly Jesus to suffer with Him. By contacting Christ in the heavens and enjoying His glorification, we are energized to take the narrow pathway of the cross on earth and bear the reproach of Jesus. First, this book gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and then it shows us how to walk on the earth in the pathway of the cross, i.e., how to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach. Even Moses, after the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf (Exo. 32), moved to a place outside the camp, where every one who sought the Lord went to meet with him; for both the Lord's presence and the Lord's speaking were there (Exo. 33:7-11). We must go outside the camp that we may enjoy the Lord's presence and hear His speaking. All these things are necessary for the practical and proper church life. <br><br>   The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross (signified by the going forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach), and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in this book. The Holy of Holies with its rich supply enables us to take the narrow, difficult pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation that we may obtain the reward of glory. ",
  "7510":"See note 12. ",
  "7511":"Or, permanent. ",
  "7512":"The writer of this book considered himself and his readers real river-crossing Hebrews, like the Patriarchs (11:9-10, 13-16). ",
  "7513":"Verse 15 is a continuation of vv. 8-14. Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God. First, in the church we should offer up through Him a sacrifice of praise to God continually. In the church He sings in us hymns of praise unto God the Father (2:12). In the church we too should praise God the Father through Him. Eventually, in the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit. He, as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit. This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Him. This is greatly needed in the church meetings. ",
  "7514":"Lit., fellowshipping. Doing good refers to giving, and fellowshipping refers to sharing, i.e., having fellowship in the needs of the saints. This kind of doing good and fellowshipping with others also are sacrifices that we should offer to God. These too are necessary for a proper church life. It is truly improper if in the church some needy saints are not well cared for and ministered to. This means that the fellowshipping with others is absent or inadequate. ",
  "7515":"This is vitally necessary in the church life. ",
  "7516":"Praying for the apostles is another aspect of the church life. ",
  "7517":"The sheep here are the flock, which is the church. This confirms the view that the things covered in this chapter, with the experience of the unchanging Christ as our sin offering, through whom we were redeemed, and as our great Shepherd, by whom we are now being fed, are all for the church life. ",
  "7518":"This book does not concern temporal things, such as the things of the old covenant, but eternal things, things that are beyond the limit of time and space, such as eternal salvation (5:9), eternal judgment (6:2), eternal redemption (9:12), the eternal Spirit (9:14), the eternal inheritance (9:15), and the eternal covenant (13:20). <br><br>   The new covenant is not only a better covenant (7:22; 8:6) but also an eternal covenant. It is eternally effective because of the eternal efficacy of Christ's blood, with which it was enacted (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20). ",
  "7519":"God is doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ that we may be able to do His will. God works in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure (Phil. 2:13). From beginning to end this book presents to us a heavenly Christ. Only here, with the word \"God ... doing in us ... through Jesus Christ,\" does this book imply the indwelling of Christ. It is through the indwelling Christ that God works in us so that we can do His will. ",
  "7520":"I.e., endure and receive. To bear with the word of the apostle also is needed in the church life (Acts 2:42). ",
  "7521":"The mentioning of Timothy in such an intimate way is a strong proof that this book was written by the apostle Paul. See 1 Tim. 1:2 and 2 Tim. 1:2. ",
  "7522":"The greetings in this verse are a form of fellowship in the church and among the churches. ",
  "7523":"To realize and participate in all the things unveiled in this book, we need grace. To have grace (12:28) we need to come forward to the throne of grace that we may find grace for timely help (4:16). It is when we touch the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies through the exercise of our spirit that we enjoy the Spirit of grace (10:29) and that our heart is confirmed by grace (v. 9). By such an enjoyment of grace we run the race set before us (12:1) that we may reach the goal of God's economy. ",
  "7524":"A flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 13:55) and of Jude (Jude 1). He was not one of the twelve apostles chosen by the Lord while He was on earth, but he became an apostle after the Lord's resurrection (Gal. 1:19), and he became the leading elder in the church at Jerusalem (Acts 12:17; 15:2, 13; 21:18). Reputed to be, with Peter and John, a pillar of the church, he was mentioned by Paul as the first among the three pillars (Gal. 2:9). ",
  "7525":"James ranked the Lord Jesus as equal with God. This was contrary to Judaism, which did not recognize the deity of the Lord (John 5:18). ",
  "7526":"The tribes of Israel. This indicates that this Epistle was written to the Jewish Christians, who had the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory (2:1) and were justified by faith (2:24), regenerated by the word of truth (v. 18), and indwelt by the Spirit of God (4:5), and who were members of the church (5:14), awaiting the Lord's coming back (5:7-8). However, for the writer to call these believers in Christ \"the twelve tribes,\" as God's chosen people were called in His Old Testament economy, might indicate that he lacked a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God's New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation. Perhaps he did not see that in the New Testament God had delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish people, who were then considered by God a perverse generation (Acts 2:40). In His New Testament economy, God does not consider the Jewish believers to be Jews set apart for Judaism but Christians set apart for the church. As members of the church of God, they should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as they are from the Gentiles (1 Cor. 10:32). Yet James, a pillar of the church, in his Epistle to the Christian brothers still called them \"the twelve tribes.\" (This might have been the reason that he addressed the word in 5:1-6 to the rich class in general among the Jews.) This was contrary to God's New Testament economy. See note 2 in ch. 2. ",
  "7527":"See note 1 in 1 Pet. 1. This dispersion must have included the scattering of the Jewish believers from Jerusalem caused by the persecution after Pentecost (Acts 8:1, 4). ",
  "7528":"See note 10 in 2 John. ",
  "7529":"See note 12. ",
  "7530":"The Christian faith, given by God in Christ (2 Pet. 1:1; James 2:1). ",
  "7531":"Although James might not have had a clear view concerning the distinction between grace and law, his Epistle is distinguished and remarkable in its presentation of Christian conduct, emphasizing practical Christian perfection that the believers might be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing. This may be considered the main subject of this Epistle. Such perfection in Christian behavior requires the trials of God's governmental dealing and the believers' endurance by the virtue of the divine birth through regeneration by the implanted word (vv. 18, 21). ",
  "7532":"It was by His wisdom that God, in Christ, made His eternal plan and carried it out (1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 3:9-11; Prov. 8:12, 22-31). And in His New Testament economy God made Christ first our wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). The wisdom of God is needed for practical Christian perfection. Hence, we need to ask God for it. <br><br>   In light of the content of this Epistle, it seems that James did not have a clear vision concerning God's New Testament economy. However, he did have the wisdom to portray matters that concern the practical Christian life. ",
  "7533":"James was reputed to be a man of prayer. Here he charged the recipients of his Epistle to pray for wisdom, implying that his wisdom was given to him by God through prayer. In his Epistle he stressed prayer (5:14-18). Prayer is a virtue of practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7534":"Or, with simplicity, generously, without reserve (Rom. 12:8; 2 Cor. 8:2). ",
  "7535":"A stingy man would not give; if he were to give, he would give with reproaches, with stinging words. God, who gives to all liberally, is not like such a man. ",
  "7536":"Or, wavering ... wavers. ",
  "7537":"God made man only one soul, with one mind and one will. When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself double-souled, like a boat with two rudders, uncertain in direction. Faith in prayer also is a virtue of practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7538":"Or, glory, rejoice. When a lowly brother boasts and rejoices in exaltation, spontaneously he is led to praise the Lord (5:13). He should not boast in the secular way, i.e., without praising the Lord. ",
  "7539":"Or, elevation, high estate. ",
  "7540":"It is easy for a lowly brother to boast, rejoice, and praise the Lord in his exaltation. It is not easy for a rich one to do so in his being brought low. Whether in exaltation or in being brought low, to rejoice and praise is a virtue of practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7541":"In v. 6 James used the surge of the sea to illustrate a doubting heart, and in v. 10 he used the flower of the land to portray the fading rich man. Here he used the sun in the heavens with its scorching heat to illustrate the factor that causes man's riches to fade under God's governmental dealing. In v. 17 he used even the turning of the planets to illustrate variableness, which is in contrast to the invariableness of God the Father. In dealing with the problem of our tongue in 3:3-12, he used twenty kinds of things for illustrations. Moreover, in 4:14 he used vapor to portray the brief appearing of our life, and in 5:7-8 he used the farmer's long-suffering to teach us how to await the Lord's coming. James was a wise and experienced man, having not only the experience of human life but also wisdom from the divine source through his seeking by prayer (v. 5; 3:13, 17). Yet it seems that his sympathy for and compromise with Judaism frustrated him from seeing a thorough vision of the wisdom concerning God's New Testament economy, a vision that Paul saw and unveiled in his Epistles. See notes 12 and 17 in ch. 3. ",
  "7542":"Or, hot wind. ",
  "7543":"What a sobering word to those who pursue riches! Yet it is a soothing word to the rich who are being brought low through the loss of their riches. ",
  "7544":"Verses 2-12 deal with trials (see note 13). Trials come from the believers' environment to prove their faith (vv. 2-3) through suffering (vv. 9-11). The believers should endure the trials with all joy (v. 2) because of their love for the Lord, that they may receive the blessing of the crown of life. ",
  "7545":"I.e., the approving of the believers' faith (v. 3). ",
  "7546":"The glory, the expression, of life. The believers endure trials by means of the divine life, and this will become their glory, their expression, the crown of life, as a reward to them at the Lord's appearing, for their enjoyment in the coming kingdom (2:5). ",
  "7547":"This indicates that the underlying thought in vv. 12-27 is the crucial need of the divine life. The begetting Father and His begetting us, His making us the firstfruits of His creatures (vv. 17-18, 27), the implanted word of life (v. 21), and the perfect law of life (v. 25) all confirm this. ",
  "7548":"To believe in the Lord is to receive the divine life for our salvation; to love the Lord is to grow in the divine life for our maturity that we may be qualified for a reward &#151; the crown of life &#151; and enjoy the glory of the divine life in the kingdom. ",
  "7549":"Or, tried, tested. The Greek word for trials and trial in vv. 2 and 12 is the noun form of the word for tempted here and in v. 14. The two words are very similar in form; both refer to being tried, tested, proved. To be tried, tested, proved, by outward suffering in the environment is a trial (v. 2). To be tried, tested, proved, by the inward enticing of lust is a temptation (v. 14). The trial is dealt with in vv. 2-12; the temptation is dealt with in vv. 13-21. As for the trial, we should endure it by loving the Lord that we may obtain the blessing &#151; the crown of life. As for the temptation, we should resist it by receiving the implanted word that we may obtain salvation &#151; the salvation of our souls (v. 21). ",
  "7550":"Lit., from. ",
  "7551":"The Greek word means both is untried and is untriable; hence, not temptable, not to be tempted, incapable of being tempted. ",
  "7552":"The devil, not God, is the tempter (Matt. 4:3; 1 Thes. 3:5). ",
  "7553":"The tempter, the devil, is the begetting father of sin (1 John 3:8, 10), having the might of death (Heb. 2:14) through sin (1 Cor. 15:56). He injected sin into Adam, and through sin death passed on to all men (Rom. 5:12). ",
  "7554":"Giving refers to the act of giving; gift refers to the thing given. ",
  "7555":"Lights here refers to the heavenly luminaries. The Father is the Creator, the source, of these shining bodies. With Him there is no shadow cast by turning (in contrast to the situation with the heavenly orbs, where the moon waxes and wanes by its revolving, and the sun can be eclipsed by the moon), for He is not variable, not changeable. As such, He is incapable of being tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone. ",
  "7556":"Or, variableness. ",
  "7557":"Sin, the source of darkness, brings forth death (v. 15). But the Father of lights brought us forth to be the firstfruits of His creatures, full of the vigorous life that matures first. This refers to the divine birth, our regeneration (John 3:5, 6), which is carried out according to God's eternal purpose. ",
  "7558":"The word of the divine reality, of what the Triune God is (John 1:14, 17). This word is the seed of life, by which we have been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). ",
  "7559":"Of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose by begetting us that we may become the firstfruits of His creatures. ",
  "7560":"God will renew His entire creation to have a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center (Rev. 21:1-2). He first regenerated us to be the firstfruits of His new creation by imparting His divine life into our being through the implanted word of life that we might live a life of perfection. This must be the seed of practical Christian perfection. This life will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the living center of God's eternal new universe. ",
  "7561":"Or, Know this. ",
  "7562":"Hearing tempts us to speak, and speaking is the fire that kindles wrath (cf. 3:6). If we bridle our speaking (cf. v. 26), we will quench our wrath. James's word here, given to strengthen his view of practical Christian perfection, has the tone of the Old Testament proverbs (Prov. 10:19; 14:17). ",
  "7563":"The righteousness of God does not need the help of man's wrath, which is of no use in the carrying out of God's righteousness. ",
  "7564":"This likens the word of God to a living plant that is planted into our being and grows in us to bring forth fruit for the salvation of our souls. We need to receive such a word in meekness, in all submission, without any resistance. ",
  "7565":"The salvation of our souls, according to the context of this chapter, implies the enduring of trials raised up by the environment (vv. 2-12) and the resisting of the temptation of lust (vv. 13-21). James's view concerning the salvation of our souls was somewhat negative and was not as positive as that of Paul, who said that our soul can be transformed by the renewing Spirit, even into the image of the Lord from glory to glory (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; 2 Cor. 3:18). See notes 5 in 1 Pet. 1 and 39 in Heb. 10. ",
  "7566":"The same word as in 1 Pet. 1:12. ",
  "7567":"The perfect law, the law of freedom (or liberty), is not the law of letters written on tablets of stone outside us but the law of life inscribed on our hearts (Heb. 8:10), the moral standard of which corresponds with that of the kingdom's constitution, decreed by the Lord on the mount (Matt. 5--7). Since the law of letters was not able to give man life (Gal. 3:21) but was able only to expose man's weakness and failure and keep him in slavery (Gal. 5:1 and note 4), it was a law of bondage. Since the perfect law of life is the function of the divine life, which was imparted into our being at regeneration and supplies us throughout our Christian life with the unsearchable riches of the divine life to free us from the law of sin and death and fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law of letters (Rom. 8:2, 4), it is the law of freedom. This law is the law of Christ (1 Cor. 9:21), even Christ Himself, who lives within us to regulate us by imparting the divine nature into our being, that we may live a life that expresses God's image. James might have considered this law the basic rule of the Christian life for practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7568":"In Greek, religious (adjective) and religion (noun) refer to ceremonial service and worship to God (implying the fear of God). The adjective is used only here. The noun is used in a positive sense here and in v. 27, in a negative sense in Col. 2:18 (for worship), and in a general sense in Acts 26:5. James's writing concerning God's New Testament economy is not as striking as Paul's, Peter's, and John's. Paul focuses on Christ living and being formed in us (Gal. 2:20; 4:19) and Christ being magnified in us and lived out of us (Phil. 1:20-21) that we as the church, His Body, may become His fullness, His expression (Eph. 1:22-23). Peter stresses the fact that God regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3), making us partakers of His divine nature, that we may live a life of godliness (2 Pet. 1:3-7) and be built up as a spiritual house to express His virtues (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). John emphasizes the eternal life, given to us for our fellowship with the Triune God (1 John 1:2-3), and the divine birth, which brings into us the divine life as the divine seed that we may live out a life that is like God (1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:17) and be the church, a lampstand, which bears the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:9, 11-12) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for God's expression unto eternity (Rev. 21:2-3, 10-11). Of the matters that are characteristic of the New Testament, James stresses only God's begetting of us (v. 18), the perfect law of freedom (v. 25), the indwelling Spirit (4:5), and a minor aspect of the church (5:14). He does not speak of Christ as our life or of the church as the expression of Christ, the two most outstanding and dispensational characteristics of the New Testament. This Epistle shows that James must have been very religious. It might have been because of this and his practical Christian perfection that he was reputed to be, along with Peter and John, a pillar, even the first, in the church at Jerusalem (Gal. 2:9). However, he was not strong in the revelation of God's New Testament economy in Christ but was still under the influence of the background of the old Judaic religion, the primary elements of which were to worship God by ceremonies and to live a life in the fear of God. This is proved by the words in Acts 21:20-24 and in 2:2-11 of this Epistle. Because his spiritual sight was covered by Judaism, he could not fully enter into the revelation of God's New Testament economy as Paul, Peter, and John were able to do. ",
  "7569":"Not to bridle the tongue is to speak quickly (cf. v. 19) and loosely without restriction. This always deceives the speaking one's own heart, deceiving his conscience &#151; the consciousness of his heart. ",
  "7570":"In this word of James's, given to strengthen his view of practical Christian perfection, an element of the Old Testament charges is implied (Deut. 14:29; 24:19-21, 12-13). ",
  "7571":"Not to be worldly, not to be stained by worldliness. This too is a part of James's God-fearing view of practical Christian perfection. To visit orphans and widows is to act according to God's loving heart, a characteristic of perfection on the positive side, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world is to be separated from the world according to God's holy nature, a characteristic of perfection on the negative side. ",
  "7572":"See note 4 in ch. 4. ",
  "7573":"Or, faith in our Lord. ... Cf. note 22 in Rom. 3. This indicates that this Epistle, and especially this chapter, was written to the New Testament believers in the Lord Jesus Christ of glory. ",
  "7574":"Most translators add, the Lord. ",
  "7575":"The Greek word is composed of together and to bring; hence, a collecting, gathering, congregating; and thence, the place of gathering. It was used in the New Testament to denote the congregation of the Jews (Acts 13:43; 9:2; Luke 12:11) and their congregating place (Luke 7:5), where they sought the knowledge of God by studying the Holy Scriptures (Luke 4:16-17; Acts 13:14-15). In Jerusalem there were numerous synagogues for different groups of Jews (Acts 6:9). James's use of this word here may indicate that the Jewish believers considered their assembly and assembling place as another of the synagogues among the Jews. If so, this bears, as does the whole Epistle, a Jewish character and may indicate that the Jewish Christians regarded themselves as still a part of the Jewish people, the chosen people of God according to the Old Testament, and that they lacked a clear vision concerning the distinction between God's chosen people of the Old Testament and the believers in Christ of the New Testament. See note 1 in ch. 1. ",
  "7576":"The distinctions that existed between the rich and the poor among the Christian brothers and that resulted in discrimination were a shame to the Lord and to the salvation of His divine life. ",
  "7577":"Or, in. ",
  "7578":"Or, to; i.e., in the world's esteem. ",
  "7579":"The kingdom of God here is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the overcoming believers in the coming age (Eph. 5:5; Gal. 5:21; 1 Cor. 6:10; Rev. 20:4, 6). The reality of this kingdom (see note 3 in Matt. 5) should be practiced not in the Jewish synagogue but in the Christian church, which is the Body of Christ (Rom. 14:17). ",
  "7580":"We believe in the Lord for our salvation (Acts 16:31); we love God (1 John 2:5, 15) for our overcoming, that we may receive the promised kingdom as a reward (see notes 28 in Heb. 12 and 35 in Heb. 10). ",
  "7581":"Or, tribunals. ",
  "7582":"Lit., good. This is the honorable name of Jesus Christ. ",
  "7583":"Lit., which is called upon you. See Acts 15:17 and note. ",
  "7584":"The royal law is the commandment, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" This is the king of all laws, and it covers and fulfills all laws (Gal. 5:14; Rom. 13:8-10). ",
  "7585":"Loving God (v. 5) and loving one's neighbor are the greatest requirements of the law. All the law hangs on these (Matt. 22:36-40). ",
  "7586":"Lit., work. ",
  "7587":"The word in vv. 8-11 indicates that the Jewish believers at James's time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law. This corresponds with the word in Acts 21:20 spoken to Paul by James and the elders in Jerusalem. James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers were still in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. They even advised Paul to practice such a semi-Judaic mixture (Acts 21:17-26). They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God's dispensational administration and would be a great damage to God's economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. Thus, this Epistle was written under the cloud of a semi-Judaic mixture, under a background that was obscured. Many who practice religion according to their natural concept neglect the background seen in this book. ",
  "7588":"So refers to what follows, not to what has gone before. ",
  "7589":"The law of freedom here and in 1:25 refers to the same law, the law of life. Verses 8-11 and 4:11 speak of keeping the law of letters. This verse speaks of the believers' being judged by the law of life. The believers should speak and do things according to the law of life, which transcends the law of letters. They should live according to the law of life. This kind of living surpasses the keeping of the law of letters. The unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15) by the law of letters, which is the law of Moses; the believers will be judged at Christ's judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10) by the law of life, the law of freedom, which is the law of Christ. ",
  "7590":"Or, boasts over, boasts against. ",
  "7591":"According to the context, this is to be saved from the judgment at Christ's judgment seat that is without mercy (v. 13). We must have works of mercy and love toward the believers. Only then can we be saved from the judgment that is without mercy. ",
  "7592":"The verb indicates that they have been in this condition for some time. ",
  "7593":"Lit., Go away. ",
  "7594":"It is shameful for the necessities of the poor saints to be neglected in the church life. However, James's word here, given to strengthen his view of practical Christian perfection, carries the flavor of the Old Testament concern for needy people (Deut. 15:7-8). ",
  "7595":"Faith is of life; it is living and operates through love (Gal. 5:6). Otherwise, it is a dead faith and is not genuine (vv. 20, 26). ",
  "7596":"Lit., according to. ",
  "7597":"Or, barren. Some MSS read, dead. ",
  "7598":"To be justified by faith is for the receiving of the divine life (Rom. 5:18); to be justified by works is through living the divine life. Since the living is the issue of life, to be justified by works is the issue of being justified by faith. Abraham's offering of Isaac and Rahab's receiving of the messengers and sending them out are works that issued from their living faith. A living tree surely brings forth fruit. Being justified by works is not inconsistent with being justified by faith. The latter is the cause, bringing forth the former; the former is the effect, the outcome and proof, of the latter. <br><br>   This chapter begins with the matter of having no respect of persons (vv. 1-13) and arrives at the practical care for the necessities of the poor saints, which is the justifying work of faith (vv. 14-26). These virtues, according to James's view, can be considered characteristics of practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7599":"Lit., thrust them out. ",
  "7600":"The spirit gives life to the body (Gen. 2:7); the works indicate and express the life that is in the faith. ",
  "7601":"Teachers tend to bring in different teachings, producing different opinions and causing trouble and division (cf. 2 Tim. 4:3; 1 Tim. 1:3-4, 7; Eph. 4:14). ",
  "7602":"Whatever we say will be judged, and we will be judged by our word (Matt. 12:36-37). ",
  "7603":"A wildfire with the power to spread. ",
  "7604":"An evil fire from Gehenna that contaminates us. Like the wildfire, the tongue spreads its destruction, and like the evil fire, it contaminates our whole body with evils from Gehenna. ",
  "7605":"The Greek word for course refers generally to anything round or circular that runs or rolls like a wheel. Used figuratively, it indicates a circuit of physical effects, a course, like an orbit around the sun. The word for life means origin, birth, generation. Hence, the phrase can be rendered the wheel of birth, referring figuratively to our human life, which is set in motion at its birth and runs on to its close. The tongue as an evil fire from Gehenna sets on fire our human life, which rolls like a wheel from our birth to our death, with the result that the course of our entire life is wholly under the tongue's evil contamination and corruption. ",
  "7606":"Signifying the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). See note 22 in Matt. 5. ",
  "7607":"The natures of beasts on the land, birds in the air, reptiles in the dust, and creatures in the water have been tamed by the nature of man, which is stronger than all the animal natures. However, even the stronger human nature is not able to tame the tongue. ",
  "7608":"As a restless evil, the tongue never ceases to do evil. It is full of deadly poison. Evil and death go together with the tongue, which spreads evil and death to contaminate and poison all human beings. It is the same even among Christians. ",
  "7609":"Referring to a hole, a cave. ",
  "7610":"In vv. 3-12, in dealing with the problem of the tongue, James, in his wisdom concerning human life, used twenty different items as illustrations: bridles of horses, rudders of ships, a wildfire, the world of unrighteousness, fire from Gehenna, the wheel of birth, beasts, birds, reptiles, creatures of the sea, the human nature, a restless evil, a deadly poison, a spring, a fig tree, olives, a vine, figs, salt (bitter) water, and sweet water. James was rich in wisdom concerning human life, somewhat like Solomon, the wise king of the Old Testament (1 Kings 4:29-34), but not so in wisdom concerning the divine economy. See note 11 in ch. 1. ",
  "7611":"Lit., out of. ",
  "7612":"Conduct (Phil. 1:27). ",
  "7613":"According to the context, meekness of wisdom should refer here to restraint in speaking. This corresponds with Prov. 10:19. Such meekness equals forbearance and compliance (v. 17), which are in contrast to bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in boasting and lying (v. 14). ",
  "7614":"The wisdom of having bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in boasting and lying against the truth (v. 14). ",
  "7615":"Earthly refers to the world, soulish to the natural man, and demonic to the devil and his demons. These three are always linked to one another. ",
  "7616":"This wisdom includes meekness (v. 13) and the human virtues mentioned in the rest of this verse. All these are characteristics of practical Christian perfection according to James's view, which might have been somewhat under the influence of Old Testament precepts concerning man's behavior, morality, and ethics (Prov. 4:5-8). Such wisdom does not attain to the height of the wisdom concerning the hidden mystery of God's New Testament economy regarding Christ and the church (1 Cor. 2:6-8; Eph. 3:9-11). See note 11 in ch. 1. ",
  "7617":"Or, gentle, lenient, sweetly reasonable (Phil. 4:5 and note 2). I.e., amiable. ",
  "7618":"Or, yielding; i.e., willing to yield, satisfied with less than is due, easily entreated. Being forbearing and compliant equals being meek (v. 13). ",
  "7619":"See note 11 in Heb. 12. ",
  "7620":"Or, for. ",
  "7621":"The same Greek word as in v. 3. Here it refers to the lusts of the pleasures of the flesh (members), whereas in v. 3 it refers to the pleasures that satisfy the lusts of the flesh. ",
  "7622":"Or, covet. ",
  "7623":"God and Christ are our Husband (Isa. 54:5; 2 Cor. 11:2). We should be chaste and love Him alone with our entire being (Mark 12:30). If our heart is divided by loving the world, we become adulteresses. ",
  "7624":"I.e., love of the world for the pleasures of the flesh (vv. 1, 4). ",
  "7625":"The satanic system, which is enmity with God. See note 15 in 1 John 2. ",
  "7626":"Loving the world constitutes God's lover an enemy of God. ",
  "7627":"When God acquired us to be His spouse, He put His Spirit into us to make us one with Him (1 Cor. 6:19, 16-17). He is a jealous God (Exo. 20:5), and His Spirit is jealous over us with the jealousy of God (2 Cor. 11:2), longing, jealously desiring, that we not make friends with His enemy and be His lover at the same time. This is the only time James mentioned God's indwelling Spirit, and it was from the negative side, concerning the abolishing of the friendship of the world, not from the positive side, concerning the building up of the Body of Christ. ",
  "7628":"Or, make His home. The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us that He may occupy our entire being (cf. Eph. 3:17) for God, causing us to be wholly for our Husband. ",
  "7629":"Referring to the Scripture in v. 5. ",
  "7630":"A quotation of Prov. 3:34 from the Septuagint. ",
  "7631":"According to the context, this refers to our being proud toward God, which causes Him to resist us. Our being humble also is toward God and causes Him to give us grace, which He desires to do. ",
  "7632":"I.e., be humble toward God (v. 10; 1 Pet. 5:6). ",
  "7633":"To be proud toward God is to side with God's enemy, the devil; to be humble toward God, i.e., to be subject to God, is to withstand, i.e., to stand against, the devil. This is the best strategy for fighting God's enemy; it always causes him to flee from us. ",
  "7634":"The flesh implied in v. 1, the world in v. 4, and the devil here are the three major enemies of the believers. They are related to one another: the flesh is against the Spirit (Gal. 5:17), the world is against God (1 John 2:15), and the devil is against Christ (1 John 3:8). The flesh indulges in pleasures by loving the world, and the world usurps us for the devil. This annihilates God's eternal purpose in us. ",
  "7635":"I.e., double-minded (see note 8 in ch. 1), having the heart divided between two parties &#151; God and the world. This makes people adulteresses (v. 4) and sinners, those who need their hearts purified and their hands cleansed that they may draw near to God and God may then draw near to them. ",
  "7636":"This verse is a solemn admonition to God's adulterous spouse, who indulges herself in fleshly pleasures by loving the world under the usurpation of the devil. ",
  "7637":"This word, as a conclusion to this section (vv. 1-10), is an exhortation against the fightings and desires mentioned in vv. 1-3. ",
  "7638":"James's words here and in 2:8-11 regarding the Old Testament law, and his words in 1:25 and 2:12 regarding the perfect law of freedom, may indicate that, in his view, there is no distinction between keeping the Old Testament law and living by the perfect law of freedom, the inner law of life. But according to the divine revelation in the entire New Testament, there is a definite, clear distinction between the two. Keeping the Old Testament law merely makes us right with God and men that we may be justified by the law. But living by the inner law of life (Heb. 8:10-11; Rom. 8:2) is to live and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:20-21) for the building up of His Body to express Him (Eph. 1:22-23) and for the building up of God's house to satisfy Him (1 Tim. 3:15). This is for the accomplishing of God's eternal goal according to His New Testament economy. Though we become perfect by keeping the Old Testament law, we still cannot reach God's eternal goal. Only our living by the inner law of life avails for this. Such a living spontaneously and automatically fulfills more than is required under the Old Testament law (Rom. 8:4), even to the standard of the constitution of the kingdom, as revealed in Matt. 5--7. ",
  "7639":"Fighting for fleshly pleasures (v. 1), having a friendship with the world (v. 4), speaking against a brother, i.e., judging the law (v. 11), going to do business according to one's own will, and boasting in arrogance (v. 16) are all signs of the ungodly and presumptuous confidence of a God-forgetting person. James's teaching on all these matters was based, probably, on his view concerning practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7640":"The tone of James's word here also is somewhat like the tone of the Old Testament (cf. Psa. 90:3-10). In any case, his word arouses a fear of one's self-will and instills a confidence in God, as expressed in v. 15. This kind of word always comes out of the mouth of a God-fearing person. ",
  "7641":"Or, pretentiousness, vainglory. ",
  "7642":"A concluding word to all the charges in the preceding verses. It says that if the recipients of this Epistle are helped by James's writing and yet will not do as he wrote, to them it is sin. ",
  "7643":"Verses 1-6 could be considered a parenthetical section, and it might have been addressed, in light of its contents, to the rich class in general among the Jews, since James considered the recipients of his Epistle to be the twelve tribes of the Jews (1:1). See notes 1 in ch. 1 and 2 in ch. 2. ",
  "7644":"Or, imploring. ",
  "7645":"As in Rom. 9:29, this is equivalent to the divine title in Hebrew, Jehovah-Sabaoth (Jehovah of hosts, Jehovah of armies &#151; 1 Sam. 1:3). Such a title bears a Jewish character. ",
  "7646":"I.e., satiated their gluttonous desire in indulgence, even in a day of slaughter (Jer. 12:3), i.e., in a day of judgment, when they were to be slaughtered like animals by God's judgment. This implies that they were in a stupor, unaware of their coming miseries, their miserable destiny (v. 1). ",
  "7647":"The collective singular, with the article used to indicate the class. It does not refer directly to any individual but portrays the death of the Lord Jesus, who is the Righteous (Acts 7:52; 3:14). ",
  "7648":"See note 10. ",
  "7649":"The Greek word means presence (see note 3 in Matt. 24). ",
  "7650":"See note 10. While we are awaiting with long-suffering the Lord's coming, He, as the real Farmer (Matt. 13:3), is awaiting with patience our maturity in life as the firstfruits and harvest of His field (Rev. 14:4, 14-15). Our maturing in life can shorten the period of our long-suffering and His patience. ",
  "7651":"See note 7. ",
  "7652":"Lit., groan. ",
  "7653":"The Lord will come back not only as the Bridegroom to meet the bride (Matt. 25:1, 6; Rev. 19:7-8) but also as the Judge to judge all peoples, judging first His believers at His judgment seat (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 2 Cor. 5:10). We need to pursue maturity in life in order to meet the Lord and be prepared to be judged by Him. ",
  "7654":"This is a further development of vv. 7-8, which concern the suffering and long-suffering of the faithful believers. ",
  "7655":"The Greek word &#151; in noun form here and in Heb. 6:12; Rom. 2:4; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Pet. 3:20, and in verb form in vv. 7-8 &#151; connotes patience toward persons, such as the patience the prophets had toward those who persecuted them. ",
  "7656":"Speaking in the name of the Lord indicates that the prophets were one with the Lord. Hence, their suffering and long-suffering were with the Lord and for the Lord. The faithful believers' suffering and long-suffering should be the same. ",
  "7657":"The Greek word &#151; in verb form here and in noun form in Rom. 5:3 and 2 Cor. 1:6 &#151; connotes patience toward things, such as the patience that Job had toward the things that afflicted him. ",
  "7658":"Lit., before. ",
  "7659":"We should not swear, because we are nothing, and nothing is under our control or up to us (Matt. 5:34-36). Swearing displays the acting of our self-will and our forgetting of God. But to let our yes be yes and our no be no is to act according to our divine nature, in the consciousness of the presence of God, denying our self-will and sinful nature. ",
  "7660":"See note 37 in Matt. 5. ",
  "7661":"Our being genuinely faithful and sincere in our words according to the divine nature, of which we partake, will keep us from God's judgment (cf. Matt. 12:36). ",
  "7662":"Praying brings us the strength of the Lord to endure suffering, and singing praise keeps us in the joy of the Lord. ",
  "7663":"The Greek word means primarily play on a stringed instrument, and thence, make melody. Hence, it denotes to sing a hymn, to sing praise. Whether we pray or sing praise, we contact God. In any environment and under any circumstance, humble or exalted, grievous or joyful, we need to contact the Lord. ",
  "7664":"Ill because of weakness. Weakness leads to illness (1 Cor. 11:30), and illness causes more weakness. ",
  "7665":"To call the elders of the church to pray regarding one's illness implies (1) that there is no problem between the calling one and the church, represented by the elders; (2) that a normal relationship has been restored between the calling one and the church, if the illness is due to the calling one's having offended the church (cf. 1 Cor. 11:29-32); and (3) that the sick one and the elders have thoroughly confessed to one another their sins (v. 16). The barriers in the church must be cleared away before the elders can represent the church in praying for the sick ones. ",
  "7666":"Two Greek words are translated anoint: aleipho, the word used here and in John 12:3, is the common term used for applying oil; chrio means to anoint officially for office, as a priest (Acts 10:38), king (Heb. 1:9), or prophet (Luke 4:18). Chrio, related to Christos (Christ), is used for the anointing of the Son by the Father (Acts 10:38). To anoint with oil signifies to impart the Spirit of life, who has been poured upon the Body of Christ as the anointing oil (Psa. 133:2), to the sick member of the Body through the elders as representatives of the church, for the healing of the sick one (cf. 1 John 5:16 and notes 3 and 4). ",
  "7667":"In the name of the Lord signifies oneness with the Lord. The elders do not do the anointing alone; rather, by being one with the Lord, they represent both the Body and the Head to do the anointing. ",
  "7668":"Not the usual form of the word for prayer. It is translated vow in Acts 18:18 and 21:23. ",
  "7669":"Or, weary. ",
  "7670":"The committing of sins is often the cause of illness (John 5:14). In such cases forgiveness is always the cause of healing (Matt. 9:2, 5-7; Mark 2:5). ",
  "7671":"Or, is very effective. ",
  "7672":"Lit., prayed in prayer. This indicates that a prayer from the Lord was given to Elijah, in which he prayed. He did not pray in his feeling, thought, intention, or mood, or in any kind of motivation, arising from circumstances or situations, to fulfill his own purpose. He prayed in the prayer given to him by the Lord for the accomplishing of His will. ",
  "7673":"This may imply that the ill one in v. 14 had been led astray from the truth and needed to be turned back. ",
  "7674":"According to the context of these two verses, this is not an unbelieving sinner but a believing brother who has been led astray from the truth and is turned back from his error to the truth. Hence, the salvation of his soul does not refer to the eternal salvation of the person but to the dispensational salvation of his soul from the suffering of physical death under God's discipline. James may also have considered all the virtues covered in vv. 7-20 to be aspects of practical Christian perfection. ",
  "7675":"See notes 21 in ch. 1, 5 in 1 Pet. 1, and 39 in Heb. 10. ",
  "7676":"Not eternal perdition but dispensational discipline by physical death (see note 16 in 1 John 5). From death here should equal raise ...up in v. 15. ",
  "7677":"This is an Old Testament expression (Psa. 32:1; 85:2; Prov. 10:12) used by James to indicate that turning an erring brother back is to cover his sins so that he is not condemned. Cover ... sins here should equal sins ... forgiven in v. 15, as in Psa. 32:1; 85:2. ",
  "7678":"Sins committed by the sinning brother, which brought forth death to him (1:15). ",
  "7679":"The name Peter denotes Peter's regenerated and spiritual man, whereas the name Simon denotes his natural man by birth (John 1:42; Matt. 16:17-18). ",
  "7680":"An apostle to the Jews (Gal. 2:8). ",
  "7681":"Or, pilgrims. Strictly, in this book this term refers to the Jewish believers who were pilgrims, foreigners, dispersed in the Gentile world (2:11-12). However, the principle of being sojourners could be applied to all believers, both Jewish and Gentile, because all are heavenly sojourners, sojourning as foreigners on this earth. These sojourners are God's elect, chosen by God out of the human race, out of all the nations (Rev. 5:9-10), according to His foreknowledge (v. 2). ",
  "7682":"A term familiar to all the Jews scattered among the nations, indicating that this Epistle was written to the Jewish believers. It is from the Greek word that means to scatter or spread abroad; its root means to sow. This implies that the scattered Jews were sown as seeds among the Gentiles. ",
  "7683":"All five provinces mentioned here were in Asia Minor, between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. ",
  "7684":"Both of Peter's Epistles (2 Pet. 3:1) are concerned with the government of God. God's government is universal and deals with all His creatures that He may have a clean and pure universe (2 Pet. 3:13) in order to express Himself. In the New Testament age this dealing begins from His chosen people, His elect, His own household (4:17), and especially from His chosen sojourners who are dispersed and are sojourning among the nations, the Gentiles, as His testimony. Hence, these two books emphasize the believers' being chosen (2:9; 5:13; 2 Pet. 1:10). As God's chosen race, God's choice, God's particular possession, the dispersed and chosen sojourners need to see that they are under God's governmental dealing for a positive purpose, regardless of the situation and environment they are in. Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other kind of trial or suffering (v. 6; 5:9), is just a part of God's precious governmental dealing. Such a vision will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them (5:10) that they may grow in grace (2 Pet. 3:18). ",
  "7685":"Here, the divine economy through the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead for the believers' participation in the Triune God is unveiled. God the Father's selection is the initiation; God the Spirit's sanctification carries out the selection of God the Father; and God the Son's redemption, signified by the sprinkling of His blood, is the completion. Through these steps the believers have been selected, sanctified, and redeemed to enter into the enjoyment of the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; into whom they have been baptized (Matt. 28:19) and whose virtues they are enjoying (2 Cor. 13:14). ",
  "7686":"God chose us before the foundation of the world, in eternity past (Eph. 1:4). Hence, the divine foreknowledge was exercised. ",
  "7687":"I.e., by the sanctification of the Spirit. This denotes that God the Father's selection is applied to and carried out in God's chosen ones in and by the sanctification of the Spirit, which means that the Spirit sanctifies man by causing him to repent unto God, thus making him a chosen one of God. ",
  "7688":"Here the sanctification of the Spirit is not the sanctification of the Spirit that comes after justification through the redemption of Christ (the latter sanctification is revealed in Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16). Here the sanctification of the Spirit, as the main emphasis in this chapter, an emphasis on holiness (vv. 15-16), comes before obedience to Christ and faith in His redemption, i.e., before justification through Christ's redemption (1 Cor. 6:11), indicating that the believers' obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit's sanctifying work. The Spirit's sanctification in its various aspects is revealed in an all-inclusive way in 2 Thes. 2:13, and its goal is that God's chosen people may obtain God's full salvation. God's full salvation is carried out in the sphere of the Spirit's sanctification. ",
  "7689":"Three different prepositions are used in relation to the three steps taken by the Triune God to bring His elect into participation in His full salvation: according to denotes the ground, the base; in, the sphere; and unto, the end, the result. The believers' obedience of faith (Rom. 1:5; 16:26) in the redemption of Christ and the applying to them of the sprinkling of the blood are the result of the Spirit's sanctification, which is based on God the Father's selection. ",
  "7690":"The New Testament dispensation has the blood of Jesus Christ. That blood is in contrast to the blood of animals, which the Old Testament dispensation had. The Jewish believers were familiar with the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of animals under the Old Testament dispensation, but now they had to realize that the dispensation had been changed and that under the New Testament dispensation the law of Moses and the blood of animals had been replaced by the person of Christ and the blood of Christ. The result of such a realization is that the believers obey Jesus Christ and are sprinkled by His blood. ",
  "7691":"In typology the sprinkling of the propitiating blood ushered the sprinkled people into the old covenant (Exo. 24:6-8). Likewise, the sprinkling of Christ's redeeming blood brings the sprinkled believers into the blessing of the new covenant, that is, into the full enjoyment of the Triune God (Heb. 9:13-14). This is a striking mark that separates the sprinkled people from the common people, who are without God. ",
  "7692":"The blood for sprinkling denotes redemption. See vv. 18-19. ",
  "7693":"See note 2 in Eph. 1. ",
  "7694":"See note 2 in Eph. 1. ",
  "7695":"Multiplied grace corresponds with varied grace (4:10) and all grace (5:10). The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace. ",
  "7696":"See note 3 in Eph. 1. ",
  "7697":"See notes 3 and 17 in Eph. 1. ",
  "7698":"See note 13 in 1 Tim. 1. ",
  "7699":"Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God's full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God; regeneration enlivens us with God's life, bringing us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration is accomplished through the resurrection of Christ from the dead. \"The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth into a living hope\" (Alford). ",
  "7700":"Issuing in, resulting in, with a view to. ",
  "7701":"A hope for the future in our sojourning today &#151; not a hope of objective things but a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings. Such a hope should cause us to set our hope perfectly on the coming grace (v. 13). <br><br>   The living hope, the hope of life, brought to the regenerated believers through regeneration, can be likened to the various expectations for the future brought to parents through the birth of a newborn babe; all such expectations hinge on the life of the newborn child. Likewise, the life that we, the believers, have received through regeneration enables us to have a hope, with numerous aspects, for this age, for the coming age, and for eternity. In this age we have the hope of growing in life, of maturing, of manifesting our gifts, of exercising our functions, of being transformed, of overcoming, of being redeemed in our body, and of entering into glory. In the coming age we have the hope of entering into the kingdom, of reigning with the Lord, and of enjoying the blessings of the eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In eternity we have the hope of being in the New Jerusalem, where we will participate fully in the consummated blessings of the eternal life in its ultimate manifestation in eternity. This living hope, the hope of life, hinges on the eternal life, which we received through regeneration. Only the divine life can enable us to grow in the divine life until we grow into the reality of the hope that is brought to us by that life. Thus we will obtain the various blessings mentioned above as our inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading and is kept for eternity (vv. 3-4). ",
  "7702":"When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Hence, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is (see note 17 in John 20). This is the basic factor of our regeneration. ",
  "7703":"Unto an inheritance here is in apposition to unto a living hope in v. 3. The living hope, resulting from regeneration, is our expectation of the coming blessing; the inheritance is the fulfillment of our hope in the coming age and in eternity. ",
  "7704":"See notes 32 in Acts 20 and 18 in Acts 26. The inheritance here comprises the coming salvation of our souls (vv. 5, 9), the grace to be received at the revelation of the Lord (v. 13), the glory to be revealed (5:1), the unfading crown of glory (5:4), and the eternal glory (5:10). All these items of our eternal inheritance are related to the divine life, which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying throughout our entire Christian life. \"This inheritance is the full possession of that, which was promised to Abraham and all believers (Gen. 12:3; see Gal. 3:6 ff.), an inheritance, as much higher than that which fell to the children of Israel in the possession of Canaan, as the sonship of the regenerate, who have already received the promise of the Spirit through faith as a pledge of their inheritance, is higher than the sonship of Israel: compare Gal. 3:18, 29; 1 Cor. 6:9; Eph. 5:5; Heb. 9:15\" (Wiesinger, quoted by Alford). ",
  "7705":"Incorruptible in substance, indestructible, not decaying; undefiled in purity, unstained; unfading in beauty and glory, not withering. These are the excelling qualities of our eternal inheritance in life. These qualities should be related to the Divine Trinity: incorruptible relates to the nature of the Father, which is like gold; undefiled, to the condition preserved by the Spirit's sanctifying work; and unfading, to the glorious expression of the Son. ",
  "7706":"Kept as the result of being guarded. ",
  "7707":"A military term; lit., garrisoned. ",
  "7708":"Lit., in. In virtue of; hence, by. ",
  "7709":"The power of God is the cause of our being guarded. Secondarily, faith is the means through which the power of God becomes effective in guarding us. ",
  "7710":"Three prepositions are used here concerning our coming salvation: by, through, and unto. By refers to the cause, through to the means, and unto to the result. ",
  "7711":"Not salvation from eternal perdition but the salvation of our souls from the dispensational punishment of the Lord's governmental dealing (v. 9 and note 2). The full salvation of the Triune God is in three stages and comprises many items: <br><br>   (1) The initial stage, the stage of regeneration, which is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional &#151; v. 2; 1 Cor. 6:11), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration. In this stage God justified us through the redemption of Christ (Rom. 3:24-26) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (John 3:3-6). Thus we received God's eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9) and His eternal life (John 3:15) and became His children (John 1:12-13), who shall not perish forever (John 10:28-29). This initial salvation has saved us from God's condemnation and from eternal perdition (John 3:18, 16). <br><br>   (2) The progressing stage, the stage of transformation, which is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional &#151; Rom. 6:19, 22), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In this stage God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin &#151; the law of sin and of death &#151; by the law of the Spirit of life, through the subjective working of the effectiveness of the death of Christ in us (Rom. 6:6-7; 7:16-20; 8:2); sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16), with His holy nature, through His discipline (Heb. 12:10) and His judgment in His own house (4:17); causing us to grow in His life (1 Cor. 3:6-7); transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) through the working of all things (Rom. 8:28); building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (2:5; Eph. 2:22); and maturing us in His life (Rev. 14:15 and notes) for the completion of His full salvation. In this way we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. <br><br>   (3) The completing stage, the stage of glorification, which is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, the inheritance of God's kingdom, participation in Christ's kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord. In this stage God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (Rom. 8:23) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ's glory (Phil. 3:21); conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body; and glorify us (Rom. 8:30), immersing us in His glory (Heb. 2:10) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom (2 Tim. 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:11), into which He has called us (1 Thes. 2:12), and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing (James 2:5; Gal. 5:21) &#151; even that we may reign with Christ as His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5) and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government (Matt. 25:21, 23). In this way our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God's new creation (Rom. 8:21), and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings (v. 6; 4:12; 3:14; 5:9) into a new realm, one that is full of glory (4:13; 5:10), and will share in and enjoy all that the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained. This is the salvation of our souls, the salvation that is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the revelation of Christ in glory (v. 13; Matt. 16:27; 25:31). This is the end of our faith. The power of God is able to guard us unto this that we may obtain it (v. 9). We should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation (Rom. 8:23) and prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation (Rom. 8:19). ",
  "7712":"The time of the Lord's coming (v. 7). ",
  "7713":"Referring to the last time, mentioned in v. 5. ",
  "7714":"Sufferings that become trials to test the quality. The purpose of this book is to establish and strengthen the suffering believers, who have been chosen by God, sanctified from the world unto God by the Spirit, sprinkled by the redeeming blood of Christ, and regenerated by God the Father unto a living hope, unto an inheritance kept in the heavens for them (vv. 1-4), yet are sojourners still sojourning on this earth (vv. 1, 17; 2:11). In their sojourn, sufferings are unavoidable. These are used by God to prove and try the believers' faith (v. 7), to see whether they will follow Christ in suffering for doing good (2:19-23; 3:14-18). The sufferings are used to arm them with a mind against the flesh that they may live not in the lusts of men but in the will of God (4:1-2), that they may share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the revelation of His glory (4:12-19), that they may be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ (5:1), and that they may be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded for the eternal glory into which God has called them (5:8-10). This is wholly under God's government, that He may judge His chosen people (v. 17), beginning His judgment from His own house (4:17). Hence, this book can also be considered a book concerning God's government. ",
  "7715":"I.e., testing for approval. It is the trying, the proving, of faith, not the faith itself, that may be found unto praise. (This is like the school's examination of the student's studying: what is found to be approved is the examination, not the student's studying itself.) Of course, the approval of faith comes out of the proper faith. The stress here is not on faith but on the proving of faith by trials that come through sufferings. ",
  "7716":"Much more precious than of gold ...by fire modifies not your faith but proving. ",
  "7717":"In his two Epistles Peter presents to us five precious things: (1) the precious stone, which is the Lord Himself (2:4, 6-7); (2) the precious blood (v. 19); (3) the precious promises (2 Pet. 1:4); (4) the precious faith (2 Pet. 1:1); and (5) the precious proving (v. 7). ",
  "7718":"The various trials in v. 6 come upon us so that the proving of our faith will result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of the Lord. ",
  "7719":"The Lord is with us today (Matt. 28:20), but in a hidden, veiled way. His coming back will be His revelation, when He will be seen openly by all. At that time not only He but also the proving of our faith will be revealed. ",
  "7720":"It is a wonder and a mystery that the believers love One whom they have not seen. ",
  "7721":"Into whom modifies believing. ",
  "7722":"We love Him whom we have not seen because of believing, because of the very faith that has been infused into us through our hearing of the living word (Gal. 3:2). Hence, this faith is under the proving, the trying, mentioned in v. 7. ",
  "7723":"Joy full of glory is joy immersed in glory; hence, joy that is full of the Lord expressed. ",
  "7724":"According to grammar, this word continues v. 8, but according to fact, it is connected with v. 7. The proving of our faith being found unto praise, glory, and honor results in the receiving of the end of our faith, that is, the salvation of our souls. ",
  "7725":"We are of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (see notes 23 in 1 Thes. 5 and 12 in Heb. 4). Our spirit was saved through regeneration (John 3:5-6). Our body will be saved, redeemed, through the coming transfiguration (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23). Our soul will be saved through sufferings into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His revelation, His coming back. For this we must deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age, that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:24-27; Luke 17:30-33; John 12:25). At the Lord's revelation, through His judgment seat, some believers will enter into the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23; 24:45-46) and some will suffer in weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matt. 25:30; 24:51). To enter into the Lord's joy is the salvation of our souls (Heb. 10:39 and note 3). This salvation is more precious than the salvation of the body, which the children of Israel expect to receive. ",
  "7726":"Like the Lord (Luke 24:25-27, 44-46), Peter used the Old Testament prophets to confirm his teaching concerning the New Testament salvation. ",
  "7727":"A synonym for salvation in this verse. See note 13. For grace, see notes 14 in John 1 and 10 in 1 Cor. 15. ",
  "7728":"The searching of the prophets was the Spirit's pre-application of God's salvation in the Old Testament. ",
  "7729":"The Old Testament prophets were searching into what time and what manner of time the Spirit in them was making clear concerning Christ's marvelous accomplishment through His sufferings and glories. Eventually, it was revealed to them that they ministered those marvelous things not to themselves but to the New Testament believers (v. 12). ",
  "7730":"The highly respected Vaticanus MS omits of Christ. This omission fits into the New Testament revelation concerning the Spirit. However, the other authoritative MSS have of Christ in their text. In the New Testament revelation the Spirit of Christ denotes the Spirit after Christ's resurrection (Rom. 8:9-11). Before Christ's resurrection, the Spirit who is not only the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Christ was not yet (John 7:39). The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God constituted through and with the death and resurrection of Christ for the application and impartation of Christ's death and resurrection to His believers. Although the constituting of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational &#151; i.e., the Spirit of Christ was constituted dispensationally through and with Christ's death and resurrection in the New Testament time &#151; the function of the Spirit of Christ is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). This is like the cross of Christ: as an event, it was accomplished at the time of Christ's death, yet its function is eternal; hence, in the eternal sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). In Old Testament times the Spirit of God, as the Spirit of Christ, made the time and the manner of time concerning Christ's death and resurrection clear to the prophets who were seeking and searching diligently concerning the sufferings and glories of Christ. ",
  "7731":"Christ first suffered and then entered into glory (Luke 24:26). We should follow Him in the same steps (4:13; Rom. 8:17). The sufferings of Christ, as revealed to the prophets and prophesied by them in Psa. 22:1, 6-8, 12-18; Isa. 53:2-10a, 12b; Dan. 9:26; and Zech. 12:10m; 13:6-7, are for the accomplishing of God's redemption, which, on the negative side, has solved all the problems between man and God and terminated the old creation, and, on the positive side, has released the eternal life of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. <br><br>   The glories of Christ (see note 6) are for His glorification, which He asked of the Father before His crucifixion (John 17:1) and which is for the executing of God's New Testament economy for the carrying out of God's eternal purpose. The sufferings of Christ and the glorification of Christ with the glories in different steps &#151; the factors of God's full redemption and salvation &#151; being applied to and experienced by us equal the salvation mentioned in vv. 5, 9, and 10. This is what the prophets in the Old Testament sought and searched for diligently, what the Spirit of Christ revealed to them, what the apostles preached in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit, and what the angels long to look into (v. 12). ",
  "7732":"Lit., unto. The sufferings that Christ endured were sufferings assigned to Him by God (Isa. 53:10); hence, they are of Him, belonging to Him. ",
  "7733":"The glories in different steps: the glory in His resurrection (Luke 24:26; Acts 3:13), the glory in His ascension (Acts 2:33; Heb. 2:9), the glory in His second coming (Rev. 18:1; Matt. 25:31), and the glory in His reign (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6), as revealed in Psa. 16:8-10; 22:21-22; 118:22-24; 110:1, 4; 118:26; Zech. 14:4-5; Dan. 7:13-14; and Psa. 24:7-10; 72:8-11. ",
  "7734":"Referring to the sufferings of Christ and His glories, mentioned in v. 11. ",
  "7735":"The preaching of the apostles is the Spirit's practical application of God's salvation in the New Testament. ",
  "7736":"The Greek word portrays one who is stooping and stretching his neck to look at some wonderful sight. This shows how interested the angels are in observing the things concerning Christ for God's salvation. They declared and celebrated the Savior's birth (Luke 2:8-14), they rejoice over the sinners' repenting to receive salvation (Luke 15:10), and they are happy to serve those who inherit salvation (Heb. 1:14; Acts 12:15; Matt. 18:10). ",
  "7737":"Verses 3-12 are a long sentence of blessing (well speaking) concerning God the Father, disclosing to us His marvelous and excellent salvation, beginning from the regeneration of our spirit (v. 3) and consummating in the salvation of our soul (v. 9), accomplished through the sufferings and glories of Christ (v. 11) and applied to us by the Holy Spirit (v. 12). Based on this, v. 13 begins an exhortation to those who are participating in the full salvation carried out by the Triune God according to His economy. ",
  "7738":"Calm and clear in mind, able to realize God's economy in His salvation, as revealed in vv. 3-12, without being disturbed by fear, anxiety, or any care. ",
  "7739":"The living hope obtained through regeneration (v. 3). ",
  "7740":"I.e., the salvation of the soul (vv. 5, 9-10), which will be the consummation of God's full salvation. Grace was brought to us by the Lord's first coming (John 1:17). It will be consummated by His second coming. On such grace we should set our hope. ",
  "7741":"As in Rom. 12:2. Do not be fashioned denotes a state that is a path on which God's elect, as sojourners, walk. ",
  "7742":"The Holy One is the Triune God &#151; the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit (vv. 1-2). The Father regenerates His elect, imparting His holy nature into them (v. 3); the Son redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life (vv. 18-19); and the Spirit sanctifies them according to the Father's holy nature, separating them from anything other than God (v. 2) that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may be holy in all their manner of life, even as holy as God Himself (vv. 15-16). ",
  "7743":"Through the sanctification of the Spirit (v. 2), based on regeneration (v. 3), which brings us the holy nature of God and issues in a holy life. ",
  "7744":"The Holy One, who as the Father has called us, has regenerated us to produce a holy family &#151; a holy Father with holy children. As holy children, we should walk in a holy manner of life. Otherwise, the Father will become the Judge (4:17) and will deal with our unholiness. He begot us with life inwardly that we might have His holy nature; He disciplines us with judgment outwardly that we may partake of His holiness (Heb. 12:9-10). His judgment is according to our work, our conduct, without respect of persons. Hence, we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear. If we call Him our Father, we also should fear Him as our Judge and live a holy life in fear. ",
  "7745":"Peter \"is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul. In that sense `the Father judgeth no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son' [John 5:22]. The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God's government in this world, exercised with regard to His children. Accordingly it says, `the time of your sojourn[ing]' here\" (Darby). This is God's judgment on His own household (4:17). <br><br>   Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly (2:23; 4:5-6, 17; 2 Pet. 2:3-4, 9; 3:7) as one of the main items. God's judgment began from the angels (2 Pet. 2:3-4) and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (2 Pet. 2:5-9). In the New Testament age it begins from the house of God (v. 17; 2:23; 4:6, 17) and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord (2 Pet. 3:10), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium (see note 12 in 2 Pet. 3). After the millennium all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and will perish (4:5; 2 Pet. 3:7), and the heavens and the earth will be consumed by fire (2 Pet. 3:10b, 12). The results of the various judgments are not the same. Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition (see note 1 point 2, in 2 Pet. 2). However, by all these judgments the Lord God will clear up and purify the entire universe that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness (2 Pet. 3:13) for His delight. ",
  "7746":"I.e., conduct, behavior; as in Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16. ",
  "7747":"A holy fear, as in Phil. 2:12; i.e., a healthy, serious caution that leads us to behave holily. Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book (see reference 17e) because this book's teaching concerns the government of God. ",
  "7748":"Lit., something silver or something gold (e.g., a coin). ",
  "7749":"The vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life in v. 15. As a general principle, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things (Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:15; Titus 2:14). Here is an exception: Christ's blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness but on the manner of life. The whole chapter emphasizes the holy manner of life that God's chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit's sanctification for this, even Christ's redemption is for this &#151; to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should pass the days of our sojourning in fear (v. 17). <br><br>   Our old manner of life, a life in lusts (v. 14), had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain. But now our goal is to live a holy life that we may express God in His holiness (vv. 15-16). ",
  "7750":"The blood of Christ, by which we are sprinkled and thus marked out from the common people, is more precious than silver and gold. The highest price was paid for our redemption that we might be redeemed from a vain manner of life to a holy life (vv. 18, 15). For this we should have a holy fear, a healthy, serious caution before God, so that, as God's elect, redeemed with such a high price, we will not miss the purpose of this most high redemption of Christ. ",
  "7751":"Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb (John 1:29) for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This was done according to God's eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, from the fall of man as part of the world, Christ was slain (Rev. 13:8). ",
  "7752":"Referring to the end of the Old Testament times. See note 2 in Heb. 1. ",
  "7753":"Our believing into Christ brought us into an organic union with Him (Gal. 3:26-27). Then through Him we believe into God to be one with Him and participate in all His riches. ",
  "7754":"This is to glorify Him with glory (v. 11) and is the Father's answer to His prayer (John 17:1). ",
  "7755":"See note 13 in 1 Cor. 13. ",
  "7756":"The purifying of our souls is the Spirit's sanctifying of our disposition that we may live a holy life in God's holy nature (vv. 15-16). It is deeper than the purifying of our sins (Heb. 1:3) and the cleansing of sin (1 John 1:7). The latter two are the purifying of our outward doing; the former is the purifying of our inward being &#151; the soul. This purifying is like the washing of the water in the word in Eph. 5:26 (see note 3 there). ",
  "7757":"Our soul is composed of our mind, emotion, and will, which are also parts of our heart. To have our soul purified is to have our mind, emotion, and will, as parts of our heart, purified from any kind of defilement or contamination (Acts 15:9; James 4:8). Actually, this means to have our mind, emotion, and will delivered from all things other than God and fixed on God as the sole object and unique goal. This kind of purification is accomplished by our obedience to the truth, which is the content and reality of our faith (see note 1 point 2, in 1 Tim. 1). When we obey the truth, the content and reality of our faith in Christ, our entire soul is concentrated on God and is thus purified from all things other than God. This is to have our souls saved from all filthiness by our receiving the implanted word (James 1:21), which is the sanctifying truth (John 17:17). ",
  "7758":"The sanctifying truth, which is God's word of reality, i.e., of truth (John 17:17 and notes). ",
  "7759":"Since the purifying of our souls causes our entire being to be concentrated on God that we may love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind (Mark 12:30), such purifying issues in unfeigned brotherly love, our loving from the heart fervently those whom God loves. First, God's regeneration issues in a holy living (vv. 15-16); then God's sanctification (purification) issues in brotherly love. ",
  "7760":"Some MSS read, from the heart fervently. ",
  "7761":"This verse modifies v. 22. Having been regenerated, we have purified our souls unto brotherly love. Regeneration with the divine life is the base, the ground, for the purifying, sanctifying, of our souls unto unfeigned brotherly love. This section of the Word begins and ends with regeneration, which issues in a holy living toward God and brotherly love toward the saints. ",
  "7762":"A seed is a container of life. The word of God, as the incorruptible seed, contains God's life. Hence, it is living and abiding. Through this word we were regenerated. It is God's living and abiding word of life that conveys God's life into our spirit for our regeneration. ",
  "7763":"Referring to fallen man. The entire fallen human race is like withering grass, and its glory like the falling flower of grass. The believers were once like that, but the living and abiding word of the Lord, as the seed sown into them through regeneration, has changed their nature, making them living and abiding forever. ",
  "7764":"Word in v. 23 refers to the constant word; word here (used twice) refers to the instant word. When the constant word is spoken to us, it becomes the instant word. ",
  "7765":"Referring to God in v. 23, indicating that the Lord Jesus is God. ",
  "7766":"The word announced by the apostles is the gospel that regenerates the believers. ",
  "7767":"The exhortation in vv. 1-10 is based on what is unveiled in ch. 1. Three main things accomplished in the believers by the Triune God are stressed in ch. 1: the Father's regeneration (1:3, 23), the Son's redemption (1:2, 18-19), and the Spirit's sanctification (1:2). These make the believers a holy people, who live a holy life (1:15-16). Based on this, Peter charged the believers to grow in life (v. 2) for the building up of a spiritual house (v. 5). ",
  "7768":"The five negative things mentioned here constitute a sequence. Malice is the root, the source, and evil speaking is the expression. Guile, hypocrisies, and envies are the downward steps of the development from the source toward the expression. ",
  "7769":"Born through regeneration (1:3, 23), the believers become babes who can grow in life unto further salvation, and that for God's building, by being nourished with the spiritual milk. ",
  "7770":"In contrast to guile in v. 1. I.e., without false purpose, without any goal other than to nourish the soul. ",
  "7771":"The Greek word, translated reasonable in Rom. 12:1, is an adjective, derived from the noun word; hence, of the word; having the sense of pertaining to the mind (in contrast to the body), to the rational faculties; hence, rational, logical, reasonable. The milk of the word is not milk for the body but milk for the soul, the inner being. It is conveyed in the word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind and is assimilated by our mental faculties. ",
  "7772":"To grow is a matter of life and in life. We received the divine life through regeneration, and we need to grow in this life and with this life by being nourished with the milk conveyed in the word of God. ",
  "7773":"I.e., resulting in. Growth in life results in salvation. Salvation here, as the result of growth in life, is not initial salvation. God's full and complete salvation has a long span &#151; from regeneration, including justification, to glorification (Rom. 8:30). At regeneration we receive initial salvation (see note 5 in ch. 1). Then we need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God, unto full salvation, unto maturity for glorification. This will be the salvation of our soul, which will be revealed to us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus (1:5 and note 5; 1:9-10, 13). However, according to the context, unto salvation here refers directly to being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices in v. 5, and to tell out the virtues of Him ...in v. 9. ",
  "7774":"The Lord can be tasted, and His taste is pleasant and good. If we have tasted Him, we will long for the nourishing milk in His word (v. 2). ",
  "7775":"Or, pleasant, kind. ",
  "7776":"A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life. This is Christ for God's building. Here Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life (1:23-24), to a stone, which is of the minerals. The seed is for life-planting; the stone is for building (v. 5). Peter's thought went on from life-planting to God's building. As life to us, Christ is the seed; for God's building, He is the stone. After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us. Thus He will make us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone (Isa. 28:16). ",
  "7777":"Or, held in honor; differing from the word used in 1:19. There the word denotes preciousness in essence; here it indicates preciousness that is recognized and held in honor by men. ",
  "7778":"We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ, through regeneration and transformation. We were created of clay (Rom. 9:21). But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growing in us transforms us into living stones. At Peter's conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter &#151; a stone (John 1:42); and when Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was the rock &#151; a stone (Matt. 16:16-18). By these two incidents Peter received the impression that both Christ and His believers are stones for God's building. ",
  "7779":"Feeding on Christ by taking in the nourishing milk in the word of God is not only for growing in life but also for building up. Growing is for building up. ",
  "7780":"Although the nourishing milk of the word is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes our spirit, making us not soulish but spiritual, suitable for being built up as a spiritual house of God. ",
  "7781":"God's goal in the believers is to have a house built up with living stones &#151; not separated and scattered stones, nor even stones merely gathered and piled up together, but stones built up one with another. ",
  "7782":"Some ancient MSS omit, into. ",
  "7783":"Spiritual denotes the capacity of the divine life to live and grow; holy, the capacity of the divine nature to separate and sanctify. The house of God subsists mainly by the divine life; hence, it is spiritual. The priesthood subsists mainly by the divine nature; hence, it is holy. ",
  "7784":"The holy priesthood is the spiritual house. In the New Testament three Greek words are used in relation to the priests: hierosune, referring to the priestly office, as in Heb. 7:12; hierateia, referring to the priestly service, as in Heb. 7:5; and hierateuma, referring to the assembly of priests, a body of priests, a priesthood, as in this verse and v. 9. The coordinated body of priests is the built-up spiritual house. Although Peter did not address his two Epistles to the church or use the term church in this verse in stressing the corporate life of the believers, he did use the terms spiritual house and holy priesthood to indicate the church life. It is not the spiritual life lived in an individualistic way, but the spiritual life lived in a corporate way, that can fulfill God's purpose and satisfy His desire. He wants a spiritual house for His dwelling, a priestly body, a priesthood, for His service. Peter's view concerning the believers' corporate service in coordination is the same as Paul's in Rom. 12. This service issues from the three vital steps in the spiritual life: being born anew (v. 2a), growing in life by being nourished with Christ (v. 2b), and being built up with the believers. ",
  "7785":"The spiritual sacrifices that the believers offer in the New Testament age according to God's economy are: (1) Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, such as the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering (Lev. 1--5); (2) the sinners saved by our gospel preaching, offered as members of Christ (Rom. 15:16); and (3) our body, our praises, and the things that we do for God (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18). ",
  "7786":"See note 20 in Eph. 2. ",
  "7787":"Christ is a stone chosen by God to be the cornerstone for His building (Eph. 2:20). ",
  "7788":"See note 4. ",
  "7789":"In Greek, a word kindred to precious in vv. 4, 6. The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone that is precious to God, is the preciousness to His believers; but to the unbelievers He is a rejected, despised stone. ",
  "7790":"The Jewish leaders in Judaism (Acts 4:11), who should have been building the house of God. They rejected Christ to the uttermost. The Lord predicted that they would do this (Matt. 21:38-42). ",
  "7791":"In resurrection Christ became the head of the corner. In his early preaching Peter had already declared this to the Jews (Acts 4:10-11). ",
  "7792":"The reliable Christ (v. 6), being rejected, became a stumbling stone, on which the rejecting Judaizers stumbled (Matt. 21:44a). ",
  "7793":"I.e., the word quoted in vv. 6-8. ",
  "7794":"Referring to the Jews' disobedience, which resulted in their stumbling. ",
  "7795":"Race, priesthood, nation, and people are all collective nouns, referring to the believers corporately. As a race, we, the believers, are chosen; as a priesthood, a body of priests, we are royal, kingly; as a nation, we are holy; as a people, we are God's possession, a possession particularly acquired and owned by God as His treasure (Titus 2:14 and note 3). Chosen race denotes our descent from God; royal priesthood, our service to God; holy nation, our being a community for God; and people acquired for a possession, our preciousness to God. These are all in a corporate sense. Hence, we need to be built together (v. 5). ",
  "7796":"See notes 5 and 5. Royal denotes the status of our priesthood, which is kingly, like that of Christ the King, our High Priest, typified by Melchisedec (Heb. 7:1-2, 26, and note 1; Gen. 14:18). ",
  "7797":"See note 2 in Rom. 1. Holy denotes the nature of the nation. ",
  "7798":"Or, proclaim abroad. First, we must be born anew and grow in life (v. 2), and then we must be built up and serve corporately (v. 5). Now we need to proclaim abroad, to tell out. To serve corporately is to satisfy God by offering up Christ as spiritual sacrifices; to tell out is to benefit others by proclaiming abroad as the gospel the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. ",
  "7799":"Or, excellencies, excellent and glorious virtues (2 Pet. 1:3 and note 11); referring to what God is and has, and to the marvelous light of God, which consummates in His glory. To and by His virtue and glory God has called us (2 Pet. 1:3). ",
  "7800":"Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death; light is the expression and sphere of God in life. God has called us, delivered us, out of Satan's death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13). ",
  "7801":"This word from Hosea 2:23 was quoted by Paul in Rom. 9:24-27, in reference first to the Gentiles and then to the remnant of Israel, \"for not all who are out of Israel are Israel\" (Rom. 9:6). Here Peter, quoting this word, referred to the recipients of his letter, the scattered Jewish believers. At one time they were out of Israel but were not Israel. Hence, they were not God's people in the New Testament sense. Now, after being called by God, they became God's people, God's particular possession, as a treasure to God. They were shown God's mercy, which they had never been shown before. ",
  "7802":"The fleshly lusts are in man's fallen body (Rom. 7:18, 23-24) and are warring against man's soul &#151; man's inner being, composed of his mind, will, and emotion (Rom. 7:19-23). ",
  "7803":"This must be the holy manner of life (1:15) and the good manner of life in Christ (3:16), a life not only for God but filled and saturated with God. This manner of life is versus the vain manner of life of the unbelievers (1:18). ",
  "7804":"I.e., beautiful in its virtues. ",
  "7805":"The basic meaning of the Greek word is observation, inspection, oversight, a looking upon. The day of visitation is the day on which God will look upon His sojourning people, as a shepherd watches over his wandering sheep, and will become the Shepherd and Overseer of their souls (v. 25). Hence, the day of God's visitation is the time of God's overseeing care. ",
  "7806":"All the items from this verse through v. 20 are details showing the good works of the excellent manner of life (v. 12). ",
  "7807":"Lit., creation; as in Col. 1:15. Referring to anything made, such as a creature, a building, a regulation, or an ordinance. ",
  "7808":"For the expression and glorification of the Lord (v. 12). ",
  "7809":"The slanderers (v. 12). ",
  "7810":"The aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness (also in 5:9). ",
  "7811":"See note 17 in ch. 1. ",
  "7812":"Grace here refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our living, which becomes in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God (v. 20). The same Greek word is used in Luke 6:33-34 and Rom. 7:25 for thanks. So in the next verse. ",
  "7813":"Or, for conscience toward God. The consciousness of God is the consciousness of one's relation to God, indicating that one is living in an intimate fellowship with God, having and keeping a good and pure conscience toward God (3:16; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 2 Tim. 1:3). ",
  "7814":"According to the context (vv. 20-21), this must be the mistreatment inflicted by the unbelieving masters, who opposed and persecuted their believing servants because of their Christian testimony (3:14-18; 4:12-16). ",
  "7815":"Or, boast. ",
  "7816":"We have been called to enjoy grace and express God in the midst of our suffering unjustly (vv. 18-20). ",
  "7817":"Lit., a writing copy, an underwriting (used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them). The Lord has set His suffering life before us so that we can copy it by tracing and following His steps. This does not refer to a mere imitation of Him and His life but to a reproduction of Him that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings (see note 19) so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us. We become the reproduction of the original writing copy, not a mere imitation of Him produced by taking Him as our outward model. ",
  "7818":"All, inserted here, refers to all the sufferings of the Lord. The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself. This indicates that the Lord recognized God's government while He was living a human life on earth. ",
  "7819":"See note 17 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "7820":"This points out that when the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice (Heb. 7:27) on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation. ",
  "7821":"The cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment used for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13). ",
  "7822":"Lit., being away from; hence, having died to. In the death of Christ we have died to sins (Rom. 6:8, 10-11, 18). ",
  "7823":"In the resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim. 2:11). ",
  "7824":"Righteousness is a matter of God's government. We were saved so that we might live rightly under the government of God, that is, in a way that matches the righteous requirements of His government. ",
  "7825":"A suffering that resulted in death. ",
  "7826":"The healing of death. We were dead (Eph. 2:1), but Christ's suffering of death healed our death that we might live in His resurrection. ",
  "7827":"Or, turned back. ",
  "7828":"Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree (v. 24). Now He is our soul's Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us. As such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering (v. 21). ",
  "7829":"Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Our Lord, as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person. ",
  "7830":"Referring to 2:18. ",
  "7831":"The word of God (1 Pet. 1:23, 25; Rom. 10:8; Eph. 1:13). ",
  "7832":"Or, chaste; in Greek, a derivative from the same root as holy in v. 5 and 1:15. The pure and chaste manner of life must be the holy manner of life (1:15), the excellent manner of life (2:12), and the good manner of life (v. 16). ",
  "7833":"In fear modifies pure manner of life. ",
  "7834":"See note 17 in ch. 1. ",
  "7835":"Women's hair is intended by God for their glory and as a sign of their submission (1 Cor. 11:15; S.S. 4:1; 6:5; 7:5). But it was misused by many, especially by those who lived in the luxurious and corrupt life of the Roman Empire at the time of this Epistle, to beautify their lustful flesh by adorning it extravagantly with gold and other costly things. Christian wives, as holy women, should absolutely abstain from this God-condemned practice. ",
  "7836":"That the hidden man of the heart has the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit indicates that the meek and quiet spirit in us is the hidden man of our heart. Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul &#151; mind, emotion, and will &#151; along with the main part of our spirit &#151; the conscience (Heb. 4:12). Among all these, our spirit is at the center; hence, our spirit is the hidden man of our heart. As wives, the sisters in the Lord should have as their adornment before God their inner being &#151; the hidden man of their heart, which is adorned with a meek and quiet spirit. This spiritual adornment is very costly in the sight of God, and it is incorruptible, not like the material adornment of the plaiting of hair or the putting on of gold and garments, which is corruptible. ",
  "7837":"Lit., fright, or, nervous excitement. ",
  "7838":"I.e., in an intelligent and reasonable way, governed by human and spiritual knowledge that recognizes the nature of the marriage relationship and the weakness of the female, and not governed by any passion or emotion. ",
  "7839":"The female, according to nature in God's creation, is weaker than the male, physically and psychologically. ",
  "7840":"Man, including woman, was made a vessel to contain God (Rom. 9:21, 23), and the believers in Christ are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure (2 Cor. 4:7). Although the wives, as female vessels, are weaker, they are still vessels of the Lord and can be vessels unto honor (2 Tim. 2:21). ",
  "7841":"The Greek word for assigning means to apportion, to portion out; hence, to assign to. The word for honor means preciousness, valuable worth. The husbands should appreciate the preciousness, the valuable worth, of the wives and apportion it, assign it, as honor to them, duly and reasonably, as also to fellow heirs of the grace of life. ",
  "7842":"The grace of life is God as life and life supply to us in His Trinity &#151; the Father as the source of life, the Son as the course of life, and the Spirit as the flow of life, who flows within us, with the Son and the Father, as grace to us (1 John 5:11-12; John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1). All believers are heirs of this grace. See note 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "7843":"The tense of the Greek participle means be always blessing. ",
  "7844":"We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others that we may inherit blessing. What we bless others with, we will inherit ourselves (Matt. 10:13). ",
  "7845":"Good days are days of good, referring to good things as blessings. ",
  "7846":"If we are terrified and troubled by the persecutors (vv. 13-14), it will appear that we do not have the Lord in our hearts. So, in suffering persecution we should show others that we have Christ as Lord within us. This is to sanctify Him, to separate Him, from the other gods, not degrading Him so that He appears to be like the lifeless idols. ",
  "7847":"The living hope of the inheritance of eternal life. See notes 3 and 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "7848":"A pious fear. See note 17 in ch. 1. ",
  "7849":"Since the conscience is a part of our human spirit (Rom. 9:1; 8:16), to care for our conscience is to care for our spirit before God. ",
  "7850":"The Christian's good manner of life should be one that is in Christ. It is a living, a daily life, in the Spirit. This is higher than a living that is merely ethical and moral. ",
  "7851":"Sins here and in 2:24, 1 Cor. 15:3, and Heb. 9:28 refers to the sins we commit in our outward conduct; whereas sin in 2 Cor. 5:21 and Heb. 9:26 refers to sin that is in our nature by birth. Christ died for our sins, bearing up our sins on the cross, that our sins might be forgiven by God. But He was made sin and took away the sin of the world that the problem of our sin might be solved. Peter did not deal first with sin in our nature but with sins in our conduct, in our manner of life (v. 16). The emphasis of this book is that Christ's death redeemed us from our inherited vain manner of life (1:18-19). ",
  "7852":"This indicates that Christ's death was for redemption, not for martyrdom. On the cross He was our Substitute and bore our sins; He, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of us, the unrighteous, by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of our sins and bring us to God. This was to redeem us from our sins back to God, from our unrighteous manner of life back to the righteous God. ",
  "7853":"Not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit as the essence of Christ's divinity (Rom. 1:4; cf. John 4:24a). The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh &#151; which He received through His incarnation (John 1:14) &#151; not in His Spirit as His divinity. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection. ",
  "7854":"This refers to the Spirit in v. 18, indicating and proving that Christ, after dying in His flesh, was still active in this Spirit. ",
  "7855":"Not to preach the good news but to proclaim the victory achieved by God, that is, that through Christ's death on the cross God destroyed Satan and his power of darkness (Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15). ",
  "7856":"Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning the spirits in prison. The most acceptable according to the Scriptures is as follows: the spirits here refer not to the disembodied spirits of dead human beings held in Hades but to the angels (angels are spirits &#151; Heb. 1:14) who fell through disobedience at Noah's time (v. 20 and Life-study of Genesis, Message 27, pp. 363-4) and are imprisoned in pits of gloom, awaiting the judgment of the great day (2 Pet. 2:4-5; Jude 6). After His death in the flesh, Christ in His living Spirit as His divinity went (probably to the abyss &#151; Rom. 10:7) to these rebellious angels to proclaim, perhaps, God's victory, accomplished through His incarnation in Christ and Christ's death in the flesh, over Satan's scheme to derange the divine plan. ",
  "7857":"Referring to Tartarus, the deep and gloomy pits (2 Pet. 2:4 and Jude 6), where the fallen angels are kept. ",
  "7858":"Not human but angelic beings, different from the eight souls. ",
  "7859":"\"The Greek means `arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger,' as Acts 27:44\" (Darby). ",
  "7860":"Water was the medium through which the saving was accomplished. The ark saved Noah and his family from God's judgment, the destruction of the world by the flood. But the water saved them from the corrupted generation and separated them unto a new age, just as the water of the Red Sea did for the children of Israel (Exo. 14:22, 29; 1 Cor. 10:1-2) and the water of baptism for the New Testament believers (v. 21). ",
  "7861":"Referring to the water mentioned in the preceding verse, of which the water of baptism is the antitype. This indicates that Noah and his family's passing through the flood within the ark was a type of our passing through baptism. The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment; in like manner the water of baptism delivers us out of the inherited vain manner of life into a manner of life of resurrection in Christ. This is the main emphasis of this book. Christ redeemed us for this (1:18-19). Christ's redemption was accomplished by Christ's death and was accepted and applied to us, in baptism, by the Spirit through Christ's resurrection. Now our daily walk should be in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ; it should be a walk in which we live Christ in resurrection through the life power of His Spirit (Rom. 6:4-5). This is a new and excellent manner of life that glorifies God (2:12). ",
  "7862":"In apposition to antitype. ",
  "7863":"Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh &#151; the dirt of our fallen nature and the defilement of fleshly lust. The erroneous teaching concerning baptismal salvation, a teaching based on this verse and Mark 16:16 and Acts 22:16, is corrected here. Baptism is only a figure; its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life. ",
  "7864":"The Greek word denotes a question, an inquiry. Its meaning is very much disputed. The right meaning seems to be as indicated by Alford &#151; \"the seeking after God in a good and pure conscience.\" It is this that governs the proper Christian life. This kind of question, which asks for something, can be considered an appeal or demand. Peter's thought here may be that baptism is the baptized one's appeal to God for a good conscience toward God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more accusation and that instead we are full of peace and are confident that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual. ",
  "7865":"This additional word not only unveils to us, further, the glorious result of the suffering of Christ &#151; His exaltation after His resurrection and the high and honorable position He now holds in the heavens at the right hand of God &#151; but also indicates how glorious and honorable is the organic union we have entered into with Him through baptism, for we were baptized into Him (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). ",
  "7866":"Some MSS add, for us. ",
  "7867":"This indicates that the Christian life is a battle. ",
  "7868":"One main purpose of this book is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their suffering of persecution (1:6-7; 2:18-25; 3:8-17; 4:12-19). They should have the same mind that Christ had in His suffering (3:18-22). The main function of our mind is to understand and realize. To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind (Rom. 12:2) to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God's purpose. ",
  "7869":"Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh (v. 2); suffering cools them down. The purpose of Christ's redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life (1:18-19). Suffering responds to Christ's redemption in fulfilling this purpose, preserving us from a sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissoluteness (vv. 3-4). Such suffering, mainly from persecution, is God's discipline in His governmental dealing. To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined in the flesh by God (v. 6). Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering. ",
  "7870":"I.e., no longer to live in the vain manner of life handed down from our fathers (1:18), but in a holy and excellent manner of life (1:15; 2:12), pure in holy fear and good in Christ (3:2, 16). This is the will of God. ",
  "7871":"Lit., purpose, will. I.e., intention, inclination; hence, desire. ",
  "7872":"I.e., in the vain manner of life (1:18). ",
  "7873":"The Greek word means to be a host or a guest, to be foreign, alien; to entertain, to lodge; to think it strange. To live in the flesh in the lusts of men (v. 2) is common among the unbelieving Gentiles, who are running together into the flood of dissoluteness. But to live a holy life in the will of God, not running together in the indulgence of lusts, is strange to them. It is a foreign thing, alien to them. They are surprised and astonished at it (cf. v. 12). ",
  "7874":"Rushing on in a crowd like a band of revelers. This is to live in the flesh in the lusts of men (v. 2), to carry out the desire of the Gentiles (v. 3) in the vain manner of life (1:18). ",
  "7875":"The Greek word means a pouring forth, a pouring out upon (as in a tide); hence, a flood. It denotes here the overflowing indulgence of lusts, the excess of moral corruption and degradation, which is like a flood, into which one sinks when one runs into it. ",
  "7876":"I.e., speaking evilly of (you), speaking injuriously of (you) (Acts 13:45; 1 Pet. 2:12; 3:16). The believers, whose behavior was thought strange, were slandered unjustly and accused of all manner of crimes. ",
  "7877":"Referring to the Gentiles (v. 3), who are astonished at the believers' different manner of life and speak evilly of them (v. 4). ",
  "7878":"I.e., to relate to God all that one has done and spoken in his entire life. This reveals the government of God over all men. He is ready to judge all, both the living and the dead. His judgment is His governmental administration by which He deals with the situation among men. ",
  "7879":"This must be to judge first the living among the nations (the Gentiles) at Christ's throne of glory before the millennium (Matt. 25:31-46) and then the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). This too will be God's governmental judgment, but it differs from the judgment on the believers in v. 6, which begins from the house of God in this age (v. 17). See note 17 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "7880":"Those who are now dead refers to the dead believers in Christ, who suffered persecution because of their Christian testimony, as referred to in 1:6; 2:18-21; 3:16-17; and 4:12-19. This kind of persecution was considered by Peter in this book as God's judgment, which is according to the government of God and which begins from the house of God (v. 17). The gospel was preached to these dead believers while they were living, that they might, on the one hand, be judged, dealt with, by God in the flesh according to men through the opposers' persecution, but, on the other hand, live in the spirit according to God by believing in Christ. This shows how strict and serious is the judgment of God in His governmental administration. If the believers, who have been obedient to the gospel, are dealt with by God's governmental judgment, how much more will those who oppose the gospel and slander the believers be judged by God's dealing (vv. 17-18)! ",
  "7881":"See note 17 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "7882":"The believers' spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of God (John 3:6; Rom. 8:10-11). Thus it has become a mingled spirit, in which the believers live and walk (Rom. 8:4). ",
  "7883":"All things on which the flesh rests will pass away, and the end of them, the apostle tells us here, has drawn near. This warns us that a life lived in the flesh in the lusts of men (v. 2) will soon be ended, for it is related to all things that will shortly pass away. Therefore, we should be sober-minded and be sober unto prayers. ",
  "7884":"The Greek word means be of a sound mind, have a mind of sobriety, be able to understand things properly and thoroughly without being disturbed. ",
  "7885":"I.e., be sober to watch, be vigilant. This is to be on guard; hence, to be sober unto prayers. This equals the Lord's word, \"Watch and pray\" (Matt. 26:41; Luke 21:36). See note 8 in ch. 5. ",
  "7886":"Or, serving. ",
  "7887":"See notes 2 in ch. 1 and 10 in ch. 5. The varied grace of God, like the \"all grace\" in ch. 5, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects (2 Cor. 13:14; 12:9). As good stewards, we should minister such grace, not merely doctrine nor any vain thing, to the church and the saints by the gift we have received. ",
  "7888":"The divine speakings or utterances as revelations. In the ministry of grace, as mentioned in v. 10, our speaking should be God's speaking, God's utterance, which conveys divine revelation. ",
  "7889":"Through the Spirit of Christ, God supplies to us the serving strength of Christ's resurrection life (Phil. 1:19; 4:13). ",
  "7890":"This indicates that all our ministry of grace, whether in speaking or in serving, should be full of Christ, that God may be glorified through Christ in all things. ",
  "7891":"Glory is without and might is within. Might supplies the strength within us; glory is God glorified upon us. Hence, glory corresponds with glorified, and might with strength. ",
  "7892":"The Greek word for fiery ordeal means burning, signifying the burning of a smelting furnace for the purifying of gold and silver (Prov. 27:21; Psa. 66:10); this is similar to the metaphor used in 1:7. Peter considered the persecution that the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life. This is God's way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own house (vv. 17-19). ",
  "7893":"Or, testing. ",
  "7894":"See note 4. Fiery persecution is common to the believers; they should not think that it is strange or alien to them, and they should not be surprised and astonished by it. ",
  "7895":"The name denotes the person. To be in the name of Christ is actually to be in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15) and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and are one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings (v. 13), in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10). ",
  "7896":"Lit., the Spirit of glory and that of God. The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory (v. 13). ",
  "7897":"The same word as in Matt. 11:28. The sense here is to remain. ",
  "7898":"Lit., an overseer of others' affairs; denoting one who makes trouble by interfering in others' business. ",
  "7899":"Gk. Christianos, a word formed from Latin. The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. One who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar, or Kaisar, was called Kaisarianos, which means an adherent of Kaisar, a person who belongs to Kaisar. When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar. Then, at Antioch (Acts 11:26) they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, this verse says, \"As a Christian, let him not be ashamed\"; that is, if any believer suffers at the hands of the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name. <br><br>   Today the term Christian should bear a positive meaning, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but also having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed but should be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify (express) God in this name. ",
  "7900":"To glorify God is to express Him in glory. ",
  "7901":"This book shows the government of God, especially in relation to His dealings with His chosen people. The sufferings they undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as they. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from His own household, and it is not exercised just once or twice but is being carried out continuously until the Lord's coming. See note 17 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "7902":"Or, household; that is, the church, composed of the believers (2:5; Heb. 3:6; 1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:19). From this house, as His own house, God begins His governmental administration by God's disciplinary judgment over His own children, that He may have strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious toward His government. This is for the establishing of His kingdom, which is covered in Peter's second Epistle (2 Pet. 1:11). ",
  "7903":"This indicates that the unbelievers, who disobey the gospel of God, will undergo a judgment more severe than that which the believers undergo. ",
  "7904":"This refers mainly to the disobedience of the unbelieving Jews, who rebelled against and opposed the change of dispensation, a turn from the Old Testament law of Moses to the New Testament gospel of Jesus Christ. This Epistle was written to Jewish believers (the chosen sojourners of the dispersion &#151; 1:1), who were suffering persecution. The persecution they were suffering did not come mainly from the Gentiles; it came mainly from the opposing Jews, the unbelieving Jews, those who disobeyed the gospel. ",
  "7905":"Referring to the believers, who become righteous by being justified through their faith in Christ (Rom. 5:1) and by living a righteous life in Christ (Phil. 3:9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rev. 19:8). ",
  "7906":"Not saved (through the Lord's death) from eternal perdition but saved (through the trials of persecution as God's disciplinary judgment) from the coming destruction (1 Thes. 5:3, 8 and note 8). The believer, who is disciplined by God through the suffering of persecution that his life may be purified, is saved through the difficulty of persecution from the destruction by God's wrath toward the world, especially toward the unbelieving Jews, and from the coming destruction of Jerusalem. ",
  "7907":"I.e., stand. Among the early apostles there was a strong belief that the Lord Jesus would come back soon to judge the unbelieving sinners, who are ungodly and disobey His gospel (2 Thes. 1:6-9). Peter's word here should refer to this. In God's government, if the righteous, who has obeyed God's gospel and lives a righteous life before God, is saved with difficulty, suffering persecution as the means of God's disciplinary punishment that his life may be purified, where will the ungodly, who disobeys God's gospel and lives a sinful life against His government, stand when the destruction by His wrath comes? ",
  "7908":"Those also who suffer according to the will of God should trust in the Lord as others do. ",
  "7909":"According to His will, God wants us and has appointed us to suffer for Christ's sake (3:17; 2:15; 1 Thes. 3:3). ",
  "7910":"Lit., to give in charge as a deposit; as in Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32; 1 Tim. 1:18; and 2 Tim. 2:2. When the believers suffer persecution in their body, especially as in martyrdom, they should commit their souls as a deposit to God, the faithful Creator, as the Lord committed His spirit to the Father (Luke 23:46). ",
  "7911":"Persecution can damage only the bodies of the suffering believers, not their souls (Matt. 10:28). Their souls are kept by the Lord as the faithful Creator. They should cooperate with the Lord by their commitment in faith. ",
  "7912":"Or, doing right, good, and noble deeds. ",
  "7913":"The Creator not of the new creation in the new birth but of the old creation. Persecution is a suffering in the old creation. God as our Creator can preserve our soul, which He created for us. He has even numbered our hairs (Matt. 10:30). He is loving and faithful. His loving and faithful care (5:7) accompanies His justice in His governmental administration. While He is judging us, His household, in His government, His love cares for us faithfully. In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our bodies, we should commit our souls to His faithful care. ",
  "7914":"This indicates that vv. 1-11 are a concluding word to the preceding section (4:12-19), concerning suffering for Christ in nobly doing right. The exhortation is spread over the elders in the church in vv. 1-4, over the younger members in v. 5, and over all in common in vv. 6-11. ",
  "7915":"Elders are the overseers of the church (see note 2 in 1 Tim. 3), those who take the lead among the believers in spiritual things (Heb. 13:17). The apostle exhorts them first, expecting that they will take the lead to suffer nobly for Christ. ",
  "7916":"Peter was the first of the initial twelve apostles (Matt. 10:1-4; Acts 1:13), and, while he was an apostle, he was also one of the elders in the church at Jerusalem, as was the apostle John (2 John 1; 3 John 1; Acts 15:6; 21:17-18). Here, in exhorting the elders in the other churches, Peter used not his apostleship but his eldership that he might speak with them on their level in an intimate way. ",
  "7917":"Peter and the early apostles were witnesses of Christ (Acts 1:8), not only as eyewitnesses testifying of what they had seen of Christ's suffering (Acts 5:32; 10:39) but also as martyrs vindicating their testimony by suffering martyrdom for Him (Acts 22:20; 2 Cor. 1:8-9; 4:10-11; 11:23; 1 Cor. 15:31). This is to share in the sufferings of Christ (4:13), to participate in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10). ",
  "7918":"Peter was first a witness, a martyr, a partaker of the sufferings of Christ, then a partaker of His glory (Rom. 8:17). Christ Himself had gone the same way (1:11; Luke 24:26). ",
  "7919":"To shepherd the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ suffered (Col. 1:24). This will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory (v. 4). ",
  "7920":"Lit., little flock; i.e., the church of God (Acts 20:28), which is little in number (Luke 12:32) compared with the world. The church as the little flock is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in (Matt. 13:31-32 and notes), not a huge religion like Christendom. ",
  "7921":"Taking the oversight, looking diligently to be aware of the situation. ",
  "7922":"I.e., according to God's nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man's preference, interest, and purpose. ",
  "7923":"I.e., exercising lordship over the ruled (Matt. 20:25). Among the believers, besides Christ there should be no other lord; all should be servants, even slaves (Matt. 20:26-27; 23:10-11). The elders in the church can exercise only leadership (not lordship), which all the believers should honor and follow (1 Thes. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17). ",
  "7924":"Lit., lots, portions; hence, allotments, portions entrusted, referring here to the flock mentioned in the following clause. The churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotment, their portion, entrusted to them by God for their care. ",
  "7925":"I.e., taking the lead to serve and care for the church, that the believers may follow. ",
  "7926":"See note 2. ",
  "7927":"At the apostle's time crowns were given to victors in athletic games (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service. The glory of this crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11). ",
  "7928":"Although the Greek word is the same as in v. 1, it should, in principle, refer to all older men. ",
  "7929":"The Greek word is derived from a noun meaning a slave's apron; such an apron girded up the slave's loose garments in the service. It is used here as a figure of speech, signifying the putting on of humility as a virtue in service. This figure came evidently from Peter's impression of how the Lord girded Himself with a towel when He humbled Himself to wash the disciples' feet, especially Peter's (John 13:4-7). The thought of girding up had already been introduced by Peter in 1:13. ",
  "7930":"Or, lowliness; as in Eph. 4:2. ",
  "7931":"A strong word used for an army preparing to resist the enemy. ",
  "7932":"Lit., those having a show above (others). ",
  "7933":"Referring, strictly, to the Triune God Himself as the life supply, which is multiplied in the humble believer. See notes 2 in ch. 1 and 10 in ch. 4. ",
  "7934":"Or, lowly; as in Matt. 11:29. ",
  "7935":"In Greek the word is in the passive voice, indicating being made humble by God, mainly through sufferings in persecution (v. 10). This, however, requires that we cooperate with God's operation; we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. Hence, be humbled. Humbled is passive, but be is active. While God is acting to operate on us, we need to take the initiative to be operated on by Him. To take the initiative is active; to be operated on is passive. This is our willingness to be under the hand of God, which is mighty to do everything for us. ",
  "7936":"To be submissive to God's mighty hand, to be willing to be made lowly, is to take the God-honoring way that gives Him the ground to exalt us in His time. To be willing to be made low by God's humbling hand in His discipline is a prerequisite to being made high by God's exalting hand in His glorification. ",
  "7937":"Or, throwing ... upon; i.e., committing ... to, giving up ... to. The tense of the verb indicates a once-for-all act. ",
  "7938":"I.e., the whole lot of your anxiety throughout your entire life, the whole life with all its anxiety. ",
  "7939":"Or, worry, care. The sufferings experienced by the believers in their persecution cause them to worry and be anxious. They need not only to be humbled, to be brought low from their pride, their haughtiness, but also to throw their life with its care upon God; for He is not only mighty and just but also loving and faithful concerning them. ",
  "7940":"Or, He cares for you. The disciplining and judging God has a loving concern for the believers, especially the persecuted ones. He cares for them faithfully. They can throw their care on Him, especially in their persecution. ",
  "7941":"To be sober is to have a clear mind of sobriety and self-control that we may know, especially as disclosed in this chapter, God's purpose in disciplining us and His enemy's scheme to destroy us. See note 7 in ch. 4. ",
  "7942":"To watch is to be vigilant as in warfare, as with soldiers on the frontier. Here it refers especially to the suffering believers' being watchful against the anxiety that the enemy brings in while they suffer persecution. ",
  "7943":"Lit., an opponent (in a lawsuit); referring here to Satan, who is our accuser (Rev. 12:9-10 and note 9). ",
  "7944":"See note 1 in Matt. 4. ",
  "7945":"Howling in hunger. ",
  "7946":"This indicates the devil's constant and aggressive activity in seeking prey. ",
  "7947":"Peter here warned the believers who were suffering in persecution. If they would not be humbled under God's mighty hand (v. 6) and cast their anxiety on God (v. 7), they would be devoured by the roaring lion, the devil, their adversary. This teaches us that pride and anxiety make us delicious prey to satisfy the hunger of the roaring lion. In this matter Peter no doubt could not forget the Lord's warning to him regarding the devil's desire (Luke 22:31). ",
  "7948":"Not to resist nor to struggle against but to stand firmly, like a rock, on the ground of our faith before the roaring devil. ",
  "7949":"Your faith refers to the believers' subjective faith, their faith in God's protecting power and loving concern. ",
  "7950":"I.e., sufferings in persecution, according to the context of this chapter and the preceding one. ",
  "7951":"See note 17 in ch. 2. ",
  "7952":"Here but, indicating a contrast, brings in a word of comfort and encouragement to the suffering believers: You and your brotherhood are suffering your adversary's threatening, the devil's lion-roar, for only a little while, but the God of all grace, of the bountiful and gracious supply of life that exceeds all your need, will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you. ",
  "7953":"All grace refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in many steps of the divine operation on and in us in God's economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us, as mentioned here in who has called you into His eternal glory. Between these two steps are God's loving care while He is disciplining us, and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us. In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences (see notes 2 in ch. 1 and 10 in ch. 4). The God of such grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground the persecuted believers after they have suffered a little while. ",
  "7954":"I.e., to partake of, to participate in. ",
  "7955":"In Christ Jesus indicates that the God of all grace went through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus they can participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God (1:1-2) as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners could be brought into God's eternal glory! And how excellent is His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us! This is all accomplished through His \"all grace,\" which is the \"true grace\" (v. 12). ",
  "7956":"Indicating that God is personally active in the work of grace. ",
  "7957":"See note 9 in 2 Cor. 13. ",
  "7958":"Lit., to set fast, to confirm. The same word was used by the Lord in His charge to Peter in Luke 22:32. ",
  "7959":"Its meaning is very close to establish. ",
  "7960":"Derived from the word that means foundation. Hence, it means to ground solidly, as in Matt. 7:25, Eph. 3:17, and Heb. 1:10. There is a progression in the four divine acts of grace. Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace &#151; the Triune God in His dispensing (1:2) as the solid foundation. ",
  "7961":"Some MSS omit, the glory and. ",
  "7962":"Peter was an eyewitness (v. 1), testifying of what he had seen and experienced. He testified that what he wrote in his Epistle as an account of God's grace is true. ",
  "7963":"Referring to the \"all grace\" in v. 10. The apostle charged the believers to enter into this grace and stand in it. This book was written mainly to show the persecuted believers God's governmental purpose in their sufferings. That they may pass through those sufferings, God supplies them with all the multiplied, varied, and true grace (v. 10; 1:2; 4:10), which is sufficient to enable them to participate in the sufferings of and for Christ (2:21; 3:14-17; 4:12-16) and which will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them in the Triune God and bring them into His eternal glory (v. 10). ",
  "7964":"The Greek word and its definite article are feminine. It may refer to Peter's wife, who traveled with him (1 Cor. 9:5), or to a prominent sister in the Lord, who was chosen by God not only with the recipients of this Epistle but also with Peter and all other believers. Some suppose that it refers to the church. ",
  "7965":"Through the centuries the great teachers have held two different interpretations of this name: that it is figurative, referring to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire, or that it is literal, referring to Babylon, a large city on the Euphrates (Perath). The reasons for the latter interpretation are more logical than those for the former. First, it seems that Peter had no reason to use a figurative name to hide the name of the city he was in at the time. Second, all the names he used for the places in the address of his Epistle (1:1) were literal. Third, in the New Testament the name Rome is always clearly mentioned (Acts 19:21; 28:14, 16; Rom. 1:7, 15), even up to the time of the writing of Paul's last Epistle, 2 Timothy (2 Tim. 1:17), which was written probably after 1 Peter. It was when John's Revelation, a book of figures, was written, about A.D. 90, that the figurative name Babylon the Great was used for the city of Rome (Rev. 17:5; 18:2). ",
  "7966":"John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25), the writer of the Gospel of Mark. As Peter's spiritual son, he was there with Peter. Later he was taken to Paul by Timothy (2 Tim. 4:11). ",
  "7967":"Peace results from grace and issues from the enjoyment of the Triune God. Such enjoyment of God as the multiplying and multiplied grace (1:2), the varied grace (4:10), the all grace (5:10), and the true grace (5:12), as the reality of the contents of the Christian life under the government of God, issues and results in a condition of peace with both God and man. ",
  "7968":"Peter stressed the fact that the believers are in Christ (3:16; 5:10). It is of God and through our faith and baptism that we are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; John 3:5; Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3). This results in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and makes us one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). ",
  "7969":"Simon, Peter's old name, refers to his old man by birth; Peter, his new name given by the Lord (John 1:41-42), refers to his new man by regeneration. Here the two names are combined as one, signifying that the old man Simon had become the new man Peter. ",
  "7970":"Slave indicates Peter's submission to the Lord, and apostle, the Lord's commission to him. ",
  "7971":"Referring to the Jewish believers in dispersion in the Gentile world (1 Pet. 1:1). ",
  "7972":"As the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land (Josh. 13:6; 14:1-5; 19:51). This implies that the \"all things which relate to life and godliness\" (v. 3), including the divine nature (v. 4) partaken of by the believers through the equally precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises, are the real inheritance given to the believers by God in the New Testament. ",
  "7973":"Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth (Heb. 11:1), which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy. The contents of God's New Testament economy are composed of the \"all things which relate to life and godliness\" (v. 3), that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without (see points 1, 2, 4, and 5 and the last paragraph of note 1 in 1 Tim. 1). The equally precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God's New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself (faith), subjective to us in our experience. This can be compared to the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) being objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to the camera. ",
  "7974":"The Greek word means of equal value or honor; hence, equally precious. Equal not in measure but in value and honor to all those who receive it. ",
  "7975":"Referring to the apostle Peter and all the other believers in the Jewish land. All the believers in the Gentile world share with all those in the Jewish land the same precious faith, which enables them to substantiate the blessing of life of the New Testament as their common portion allotted to them by God. ",
  "7976":"In the sphere of. ",
  "7977":"Our God is righteous. Through His righteousness He has allotted the precious faith as a divine portion equally to all believers in Christ, both Jewish and Gentile, without respect of persons. And now He is not only our God but also our Savior. Thus, His righteousness now is not the righteousness only of God nor only of Christ, but the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ. In that the Lord is our Savior, His righteousness is His righteous act, His death on the cross in absolute obedience (Phil. 2:8), by which He accomplished redemption for us (Heb. 9:12), enabling us to be justified by God (Rom. 5:18). In that the Lord is our God, His righteousness is His justice, since, based on the righteous act, the redemption of our Savior Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:24-25), He justifies all the believers in Christ (Rom. 3:26), both Jewish and Gentile (Rom. 3:30). In and by such a twofold righteousness, the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, the precious faith, the precious substantiation of the New Testament blessing, has been allotted equally to all believers among all nations. ",
  "7978":"Jesus Christ is both our God and our Savior. This indicates that Jesus Christ is God being our Savior. He is the very God whom we worship, and He became our Savior to save us. At Peter's time this designated the believers in Christ and separated them from the Jews, who did not believe that Jesus Christ was God, and from the Romans, who believed that Caesar, not Jesus Christ, was God. ",
  "7979":"Or, Grace and peace be multiplied to you. ",
  "7980":"Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament (v. 1). This faith was infused into us through the word of God, which conveys to us the real knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. In the sphere of the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, and by means of this increasing and increased knowledge, the grace and peace that we have received will be multiplied. ",
  "7981":"In the sphere of, by means of. ",
  "7982":"This refers to a thorough, experiential knowledge. The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature. It is in contrast to the killing knowledge of the human logic of philosophy, which invaded the church in its apostasy. ",
  "7983":"Some MSS read, Jesus Christ our Lord. ",
  "7984":"Chapter two shows that this Epistle, like 2 Timothy, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude, was written in the time of the church's degradation and apostasy. Hence, apostasy was the background of this book. The burden of the writer was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy. God's salvation is to impart Himself in His Trinity into the believers that He may be their life and life supply. This is God's economy, God's plan. The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies. This did not lead them to partake of the tree of life, which gives life, but to participate in the tree of knowledge, which brings in death (Gen. 2:9, 16-17). Thus the serpent deceived and seduced Eve (Gen. 3:1-6). In order to inoculate against this death-poison, in his healing Epistle the apostle first prescribed the divine power as the strongest and most effective antidote. This provides the believers with all things related to the generating and supplying divine life (not the killing knowledge) and the God-expressing godliness (not the show of human wisdom). This rich divine provision, which is covered in detail in the succeeding verses (to v. 11), is more than sufficient to enable the believers to live a proper Christian life and overcome the satanic apostasy. <br><br>   Divine denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God. Hence, divine power is the power of the divine life, which is related to the divine nature. ",
  "7985":"I.e., imparted, infused, and planted into us by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who regenerates us and indwells us (2 Cor. 3:6, 17; John 3:6; Rom. 8:11). ",
  "7986":"\"All things which relate to life and godliness\" are the various aspects of the divine life, typified by the riches of the produce of the good land in the Old Testament. They are the substance of our faith's substantiation allotted to us by God as our portion for our inheritance. ",
  "7987":"Life is within, enabling us to live, and godliness is without as the outward expression of the inward life. Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory. ",
  "7988":"See note 2 in 1 Tim. 2. ",
  "7989":"The imparting into us of all the things of life is through the full knowledge of God, which is conveyed and revealed to us through His word. This becomes the faith (objective), in which our faith (subjective) is produced. ",
  "7990":"This refers to a thorough, experiential knowledge. ",
  "7991":"Referring to God, who is our Savior and our Lord Jesus Christ (vv. 1-2). He called us to His glory and virtue by His glory and virtue. His disciples saw His glory and virtue (v. 16; John 1:14) and were attracted by them. Then by this glory and virtue He called them to this glory and virtue. It is the same with all believers in Christ. ",
  "7992":"Or, to. ",
  "7993":"I.e., the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. ",
  "7994":"Lit., excellency (see note 8 in Phil. 4), denoting the energy of life that enables us to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes. Glory is the divine goal; virtue is the energy and strength of life that enable us to reach the goal. This virtue, with all things relating to life, has been given to us by the divine power, but it needs to be developed on the way to glory. ",
  "7995":"Or, on account of, on the basis of. The Greek word has an instrumental sense, but it also denotes cause here. ",
  "7996":"Referring to glory and virtue in v. 3. Through and on the basis of the Lord's glory and virtue, by and to which we have been called, He has given us His precious and exceedingly great promises, such as in Matt. 28:20; John 6:57; 7:38-39; 10:28-29; 14:19-20, 23; 15:5; 16:13-15. All these promises are being carried out in His believers by His life-power as the excellent virtue, unto His glory. ",
  "7997":"Lit., greatest. ",
  "7998":"Through the precious and exceedingly great promises we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him, into which we have entered through faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19). The virtue (energy of life) of this divine nature carries us into His glory (godliness becoming the full expression of the Triune God). ",
  "7999":"In his first Epistle the apostle told the believers that Christ had redeemed them from their vain manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18-19) and that they should, thus, abstain from fleshly lusts (1 Pet. 2:11) and no longer live in the flesh in the lusts of men (1 Pet. 4:2). Here, in his second Epistle, he unveiled to them the energy, the strength, by which they were enabled to escape the corruption in lust, and the result of that escape. The energy is the virtue of the divine life, and the result is that the believers partake of the divine nature of God and thus enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is. In our partaking of the divine nature and in our enjoying of all that God is, all the riches of the divine nature will be fully developed, as described in vv. 5-7. Having escaped the corruption of lust in the world and having thus removed the barriers to the growth of the divine life in us, we are freed to become partakers of the divine nature and to enjoy its riches to the fullest extent in its development by the virtue of God unto His glory. ",
  "8000":"See note 1 point 3, in ch. 2. ",
  "8001":"Or, in. ",
  "8002":"Lit., bringing in beside. Beside, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God's promises. ",
  "8003":"See note 19 in Phil. 1. What the divine power has given us in vv. 3-4 is developed in vv. 5-7. To supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue in the exercise of faith. This applies to all the other items. ",
  "8004":"This is the equally precious faith allotted to us by God (v. 1) as the common portion of the New Testament blessing of life for the initiation of the Christian life. This faith needs to be exercised that the virtue of the divine life may be developed in the succeeding steps and reach maturity. ",
  "8005":"Lit., excellency (see note 8 in Phil. 4); denoting the energy of the divine life, which issues in vigorous action (cf. note 3). ",
  "8006":"Virtue, the vigorous action, needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord (vv. 2-3, 8) regarding all things that relate to the divine life and godliness and the partaking of the divine nature (vv. 3-4) for our enjoyment in the subsequent development. ",
  "8007":"Or, temperance; the exercise of control and restraint over one's self in its passions, desires, and habits. This needs to be supplied and developed in knowledge for the proper growth in life. ",
  "8008":"To exercise self-control is to deal with ourselves; to exercise endurance is to bear with others and with circumstances. ",
  "8009":"A living that is like God and that expresses God. As we exercise control over our self and bear with others and with circumstances, godliness needs to be developed in our spiritual life, that we may be like God and express Him. ",
  "8010":"The Greek word is composed of to have affection for and a brother; hence, a brotherly affection, a love characterized by delight and pleasure. In godliness, which is the expression of God, this love needs to be supplied for the brotherhood (1 Pet. 2:17; 3:8; Gal. 6:10), for our testimony to the world (John 13:34-35), and for the bearing of fruit (John 15:16-17). ",
  "8011":"The Greek word is used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature (1 John 4:8, 16). It is nobler than human love. It adorns all the qualities of the Christian life (1 Cor. 13; Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:13-14). It is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love (Matt. 5:44, 46), yet a believer who lives by the divine life (v. 3) and partakes of the divine nature (v. 4) can be saturated with it and express it in full. Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love. Faith can be considered the seed of life, and this nobler love, the fruit (v. 8) in its full development. The six steps of development in between are the stages of its growth unto maturity. ",
  "8012":"All the virtues covered in vv. 5-7, from faith to love. ",
  "8013":"The Greek word denotes that certain things exist in and belong to a person from the beginning, thus becoming his rightful possession to the present. This indicates that all the virtues mentioned above are the possession of the believers and exist in them forever through their experience of partaking of the divine nature in all its riches. ",
  "8014":"The divine virtues not only exist in and are possessed by the believers but also abound and multiply in them in the development and growth of the divine life. ",
  "8015":"This indicates that the virtues of the divine life and divine nature are the constituents of our spiritual constitution, our spiritual being, making us persons who do not have the elements of idleness and unfruitfulness. ",
  "8016":"Lit., unworking; hence, idle. One who is not idle may still be unfruitful. To be fruitful requires more growth in life and more supply of life. Idleness and unfruitfulness are constituents of our fallen being; working, the energizing of life, and fruitfulness are the constituents of our being that is growing in the divine life. ",
  "8017":"This indicates that what is covered in vv. 5-7 is the development of the growth of the divine life unto its maturity. ",
  "8018":"The constitution that has the spiritual virtues as its constituents advances in many steps toward the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a view to the full realization of the all-inclusive embodiment of the Triune God. In this section of the Word, three prepositions are used regarding the relationship between the experience of life and spiritual knowledge: in, in v. 2, referring to the sphere of the knowledge; through, in v. 3, referring to the channel of the knowledge; and unto, in v. 8, referring to the knowledge in view as a goal. ",
  "8019":"See note 2. ",
  "8020":"See note 8. ",
  "8021":"From the root word that means to close the eyes (because of strong light); hence, to be shortsighted. To be thus shortsighted is to be spiritually blind, unable to see something further in the divine life and divine nature of the Triune God dispensed into the believers as their bountiful supply. ",
  "8022":"The Greek phrase has the sense of willing to forget, i.e., willing to forget the experience of the cleansing of our past sins. That cleansing took place so that we could go on in the divine life by partaking of the divine nature to reach the maturity of life. This is not to deny the faithful profession we made when we believed in Christ and were baptized into Him, or to lose the assurance of salvation that we received at that time, but to neglect what the initiation of salvation meant to us. ",
  "8023":"Or, Therefore rather, brothers, be diligent. ... ",
  "8024":"I.e., to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life. This makes God's calling and selection of us firm. ",
  "8025":"See note 8. ",
  "8026":"Referring to the kingdom of God, which was given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Dan. 7:13-14) and which will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God's glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6). To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God's eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12 and notes 2 and 3). ",
  "8027":"The bountiful supply that we enjoy in the development of the divine life and divine nature (vv. 3-7) will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord. It will enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom by all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues (energy) unto the splendid glory of God. This is not merely to be saved but, after being saved, to pursue the growth and maturity in the divine life and thereby receive the kingdom reward. See note 28 in Heb. 12. ",
  "8028":"I.e., the truth that is present with the believers, which they have already received and now possess. In the first section of this chapter, vv. 3-11, Peter used the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against the apostasy. In the second section, vv. 12-21, he used the revelation of the divine truth, as the second antidote, to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy, a heresy similar to today's modernism. The provision of life and the revelation of truth are the antidotes used by Peter in dealing with the apostasy. ",
  "8029":"The temporal body (2 Cor. 5:1). ",
  "8030":"I.e., to put off the body, to be unclothed of the body (2 Cor. 5:4), to leave the body, to die physically. Peter, like Paul (2 Tim. 4:6), knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was now ready for it. ",
  "8031":"Peter remembered the Lord's word to him concerning his death, given at the time the Lord charged him to feed His sheep (John 21:15-19). ",
  "8032":"Or, departure; i.e., to leave the world. The same word is used in Luke 9:31. ",
  "8033":"Lit., follow out. ",
  "8034":"Myths were the superstitious stories cleverly devised in Greek philosophy, which was related to the apostasy. ",
  "8035":"The Greek word means presence. ",
  "8036":"\" `Admitted into immediate vision of the glory,' a word used for full initiation into the mysteries\" (Darby). Peter realized that he, James, and John had been admitted into the highest degree of initiation at the Lord's transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty. He considered the transfiguration of the Lord a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36. The Lord's transfiguration in glory was a fact, and he was in it. The Lord's coming back in glory also will be a fact, as real as the Lord's transfiguration, and he will be in it as well. This was not a cleverly devised myth told to the believers by the apostles. ",
  "8037":"I.e., magnificence, greatness in splendor, honor, and glory, even magnificent glory (v. 17), as that which appeared to the eyes of Peter and the other two disciples in the Lord's transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2; Luke 9:32). ",
  "8038":"Or, carried along. So also in vv. 18 and 21. ",
  "8039":"The overshadowing cloud at the Lord's transfiguration (Luke 9:34-35), like the shekinah glory that overshadowed the propitiation place (Exo. 25:20; 40:34). ",
  "8040":"And indicates that in addition to the truth of the Lord's transfiguration, covered in the preceding verses as the inoculation against superstitious myths, the truth of the prophetic word is used for a more sure confirmation. ",
  "8041":"Peter likened the word of prophecy in the Scripture to a lamp shining in a dark place. This indicates that (1) this age is a dark place in the dark night (Rom. 13:12), and all the people of this world are moving and acting in darkness; and (2) the prophetic word of the Scripture, as the shining lamp to the believers, conveys spiritual light that shines in their darkness (not merely knowledge in letters for their mental apprehension), guiding them to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord's appearing dawns. Before the Lord as the sunlight appears, we need this word as light to shine over our footsteps. ",
  "8042":"Or, murky place, a place that is squalid, dry, and neglected. This is a metaphor illustrating the darkness in the apostasy. ",
  "8043":"A metaphor illustrating a coming time that will be full of light, as a bright day dawning, with the morning star rising, before its dawning, in the hearts of the believers, who are illuminated and enlightened by giving heed to the shining word of prophecy in the Scripture. In the time of apostasy the believers do well to give heed in this matter, that the prophetic word, as a lamp, may shine through the darkness of apostasy until such a day dawns upon them. This will cause and encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord's presence and be watchful so that they will not miss the Lord in the secret part of His coming (parousia), when He will come as a thief (see notes 27 in Matt. 24 and 8 in 2 Thes. 2). Hence, this metaphor must allude to the coming age, the age of the kingdom, as a day that will dawn at the appearing (the coming) of the Lord (v. 16) as the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2), whose light will shine to break through the gloom of the dark night of this age. Preceding this, in the darkest hour of the night the Lord will appear as the morning star (Rev. 2:28; 22:16) to those who are watchful and looking for His dear appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). They have been enlightened by the shining of the prophetic word, which is able to lead them to the dawning day. <br><br>   If we give heed to the word in the Bible, which shines as a lamp in a dark place, we will have His rising in our hearts to shine in the darkness of apostasy where we are today, before His actual appearing as the morning star. ",
  "8044":"Referring to the prophet who spoke the prophecy or to the writer who wrote the prophecy. ",
  "8045":"Lit., loosening, untying; hence, disclosure, explanation, exposition. One's own interpretation means the prophet's or writer's own explanation or exposition, which would not be inspired by God through the Holy Spirit. The thought here is that no prophecy of Scripture is of the prophet's or writer's own concept, idea, or understanding; no prophecy comes from that source, the source of man; no prophecy originates from any prophet's or writer's private and personal thought. This is confirmed and explained by the succeeding verse. ",
  "8046":"For introduces an explanation of the preceding verse. No prophecy of Scripture is of the prophet's or writer's exposition, for no prophecy was ever borne, or carried along, by the will of man. Rather, men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit. ",
  "8047":"In Greek the same word as in vv. 17, 18. No prophecy was ever borne by the will of man. Man's will, desire, and wish, with his thought and exposition, were not the source from which any prophecy came; the source was God, by whose Holy Spirit men were borne, as a ship is borne by the wind, to speak out the will, desire, and wish of God. ",
  "8048":"After presenting to the believers (in ch. 1) the rich provision of the divine life and the shining enlightenment of the divine truth, thus providing for the maintenance of life and inoculating against the poison of the apostasy, in this chapter the apostle faithfully indicated as a warning to the believers the awful contents of the apostasy and its dreadful result. This warning is a close parallel to the warning given in Jude 4-19. ",
  "8049":"Or, bring in by smuggling. Lit., to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways. It means to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared. Here it denotes the false teachers' bringing in and introducing their false teachings alongside the true ones. ",
  "8050":"The Greek word means choices of opinion (of doctrine) different from that usually accepted, \"self-chosen doctrines, alien from the truth\" (Alford). Such doctrines cause division and produce sects. This word is used also in Acts 5:17; 15:5; 24:5, 14; 26:5; 28:22; 1 Cor. 11:19; and Gal. 5:20; and in Titus 3:10 in the adjective form, heretical (there rendered factious). Here it denotes the false and heretical doctrines brought in by the false teachers, the heretics. Such doctrines are like those of today's modernism. ",
  "8051":"This implies the Lord's person and His redemptive work. The false teachers at Peter's time, like today's modernists in their apostasy, denied both the person of the Lord as the Master and His redemption, by which the Lord purchased the believers. ",
  "8052":"In this Epistle, Peter used three different Greek words concerning the consequence of the apostasy under God's governmental judgment: <br><br>   (1) Apollumi signifies to destroy utterly; in the middle voice, to perish, as in 3:6. The thought is not extinction but ruin, loss (not of being but of well-being). In Matt. 10:28; 22:7; Mark 12:9; Luke 17:27, 29; John 3:16; 10:28; 17:12; 1 Cor. 10:9-10; 2 Cor. 2:15; 4:3; 2 Thes. 2:10; and Jude 5, 11, this word unveils more concerning God's governmental judgment. In 3:9 it denotes the punishment of God's governmental discipline. <br><br>   (2) Apoleia, akin to apollumi, indicates loss (of well-being, not of being), ruin, destruction, or (physical, spiritual, or eternal) perdition. It is rendered destructive and destruction in 2:1, and destruction in 2:3; 3:7, 16. The same word is used to denote the different results of God's varied judgments (see note 17 par. 2, in 1 Pet. 1). In cases such as those described in 2:1, 3; 3:7; John 17:12; Rom. 9:22; Phil. 1:28; 3:19; 2 Thes. 2:3; and Rev. 17:8, 11, it denotes eternal perdition. In cases such as those described in 3:16 (see note 4) and Heb. 10:39 (see note 2), it denotes the punishment of God's governmental discipline, not eternal perdition. In Matt. 7:13 and 1 Tim. 6:9 it denotes a principle used for any case. <br><br>   (3) Phthora, denoting corruption unto destruction, the destruction that comes with corruption, a destroying by means of corrupting (in reference to morality, soul, and body). It is rendered corruption in 1:4 and 2:19, and destruction and corrupting in 2:12; its verb form is used in the future passive voice and is rendered will be destroyed in 2:12, and in the present passive voice, rendered are being corrupted, in Jude 10. Its significance can be further seen in Rom. 8:21; 1 Cor. 3:17 and notes 1 and 2; 15:33; 2 Cor. 7:2; 11:3; Gal. 6:8; Rev. 11:18; 19:2. ",
  "8053":"Lit., follow out. ",
  "8054":"I.e., the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament (1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18; Titus 1:1). It is designated by other titles according to its various virtues, such as the straight way (v. 15 and note 1; cf. Heb. 12:13), the way of righteousness (v. 21 and note; Matt. 21:32), the way of peace (Luke 1:79; Rom. 3:17), the way of salvation (Acts 16:17), the way of God (Matt. 22:16; Acts 18:26), the way of the Lord (John 1:23; Acts 18:25), and the Way (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22). It is slandered as the way of heresy (Acts 24:14). ",
  "8055":"First Peter stresses God's governmental judgment (1 Pet. 4:17-18). This is continued in 2 Peter. Under God's government the fallen angels were caught and are being kept for judgment (v. 4), and the age of the deluge and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were all judged (vv. 5-9). But God will mete out especially serious judgment to the New Testament heretics (v. 10). And all the ungodly will be judged and destroyed in the day when the heavens and the earth are burned by fire (3:7). Because of this, the God of justice and holiness has begun His governmental judgment from His own household &#151; the believers. See note 17 par. 2, in 1 Pet. 1. ",
  "8056":"I.e., from ancient times, as illustrated in vv. 4-9. ",
  "8057":"See note 1 point 2. ",
  "8058":"The fallen angels (see notes 19 in 1 Pet. 3 and 4 in Rev. 12), who, according to the sequence of historical facts recorded in this chapter, were the first fallen ones in the universe. ",
  "8059":"A deep and gloomy pit, where the fallen angels are detained as in a prison. See note 19 in 1 Pet. 3. ",
  "8060":"Or, until. ",
  "8061":"The judgment of the great day (Jude 6), which probably will be the judgment of the great white throne, executed upon all the dead and the demons, and probably also upon the fallen angels (Rev. 20:11-15). It is logical that all the angels, demons, and men who have joined Satan in his rebellion will be judged at the same time, in the same way, and with the same result, immediately after their evil leader is judged and cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10), into which they also will be cast. See note 17 par. 2, in 1 Pet. 1. ",
  "8062":"Whether one is righteous and godly or unrighteous and ungodly is crucial in regard to God's governmental judgment (vv. 5-9). To be righteous is to be right with man before God, and to be godly is to express God before man. This was the manner of life that Noah and Lot lived, a manner of life that spared them from God's governmental judgment according to His righteousness. ",
  "8063":"Or, overthrow. ",
  "8064":"I.e., to live in the flesh in the lusts of men, not in the will of God; to carry out the desire of the Gentiles (1 Pet. 4:2-3) and to have a vain, ungodly manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18). ",
  "8065":"See note 6. ",
  "8066":"Unprincipled; a Greek word different from that for lawless in v. 8. Lawless here denotes especially those who violate the law of nature and conscience. ",
  "8067":"Those who, like Noah and Lot (vv. 5, 7), live a godly life, in contrast to those who live an ungodly life (v. 6). ",
  "8068":"People who, like those in Noah's time and those in Sodom and Gomorrah (vv. 5-7), live an unrighteous life, in the licentious manner of the lawless. ",

  "8070":"The day of the final judgment, the judgment at the great white throne (see notes 7 in ch. 3, 4 in ch. 2, and 6 in Jude). ",
  "8071":"See note 17 par. 2, in 1 Pet. 1. ",
  "8072":"From here to the end of the chapter the exposure returns to the false teachers and their followers, who were exposed initially in vv. 1-3. In God's governmental dealing they, especially, will be kept under punishment for the day of judgment because they go after the flesh, indulging for pleasure in the lust for defilement and in corrupting luxury, and despise the Lord's government, rebelling against the Lord's authority (vv. 10, 13-14, 18). Thus, they become persons who are like (1) animals without reason (v. 12); (2) spots and blemishes among the believers, who are God's treasure (v. 13); (3) Balaam, forsaking the straight way for unrighteous gain (v. 15); (4) springs without water and mists driven by a storm (vv. 17-19); and (5) dogs and sows, becoming defiled both inwardly and outwardly (vv. 20-22). ",
  "8073":"Referring, in general, to all those who have authority to rule, including, of course, the Lord Christ, who was anointed and set up by God and who is the center of the divine government, dominion, and authority (Acts 2:36; Eph. 1:21; Col. 1:16). ",
  "8074":"Self-pleasing, seeking pleasure for self. ",

  "8076":"Angels and them, referring to dignities in v. 10, are mentioned here in a general way; but in Jude 9, regarding the same case, the archangel Michael and the devil are singled out. ",
  "8077":"This is to keep the order of authority in God's government. ",
  "8078":"Lit., living creatures (including man); indicating men who are living like animals. ",
  "8079":"Or, irrational, having no sense regarding moral issues. The highest sense within man is his spirit, of which the conscience is the leading part. Since man's fall, the conscience has governed man under God's government. Some men are past feeling (Eph. 4:19 and note), having given up the consciousness of their conscience through their denial of God (Rom. 1:23-32). The first century heretics, such as the Sadducees in ancient Judaism (Acts 23:8), and the modernists in today's Christianity are all in this category. They have denied the Lord to the uttermost so that their conscience is seared and has lost its consciousness (1 Tim. 4:2 and note 2), as if they do not even have a spirit (Jude 10, cf. 19). Thus, they become like animals without reason, like creatures of instinct, born natural to be captured, through their lust, by Satan, the destroyer of man, that they may be corrupted unto destruction. The portrayal here shows us that fallen men can be like animals without reason! ",
  "8080":"Lit., unto; indicating that they are destined to be captured for destruction, to be made slaves of corruption (v. 19). By the supply of life through the divine provision (1:3-4) we are able to escape this corruption that brings in destruction. See note 1 point 3. ",
  "8081":"The same Greek word as for corruption. ",
  "8082":"The same Greek word as for corrupted, referring to destruction caused by corruption. ",

  "8084":"I.e., wages of unrighteous doing. ",
  "8085":"The lust-indulging heretics are to genuine believers, who are God's treasure, as spots and blemishes are to precious gems. ",
  "8086":"Lit., an adulteress. ",
  "8087":"To take the straight way, such as the way of the truth (v. 2 and note 2) and the way of righteousness (v. 21 and note 1), is to live an upright life without crookedness and bias, without unrighteousness. ",
  "8088":"Lit., following out. ",
  "8089":"Balaam was a genuine Gentile prophet, not a false one, but he loved the wages of unrighteousness (Num. 22:5, 7; Deut. 23:4; Neh. 13:2; Rev. 2:14). ",
  "8090":"I.e., donkey. ",
  "8091":"The dried up heretical teachers are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, that is, waterless clouds being carried off by winds (Jude 12), having nothing of life to meet the need of the thirsty ones. ",

  "8093":"Or, behave, conduct themselves. ",
  "8094":"See note 1 point 3. ",
  "8095":"Or, to. ",
  "8096":"To take the way of righteousness is to live a life that is right with both God and man; it is another aspect of the way of the truth (v. 2 and note 2) and the straight way (v. 15 and note 1). This is the way of living a life according to God's righteousness, a way that can receive His governmental judgment (vv. 3, 9) for His kingdom of righteousness (Rom. 14:17; Matt. 5:20). Peter in his Epistles stressed both the manner of life and the way of life because his writings are based on the governmental point of view of God's administration. To correspond with the government of Him who is holy and righteous, God's people need to have a manner of life that is holy, pure, good, and excellent (1 Pet. 1:15; 3:16, 2; 2:12; 2 Pet. 3:11), not licentious and vain (v. 7; 1 Pet. 1:18), in His straight way of righteousness and truth. ",
  "8097":"Dogs and sows are unclean animals according to the ordinances of God's holiness (Lev. 11:27, 7; Matt. 7:6 and note 2). Dogs are accustomed to eating filthy things. They vomit what they eat and turn to their own vomit, becoming filthy inwardly. Sows wallow in the mud, making themselves filthy outwardly. The God-denying heretics eventually become like these dirty animals, making themselves filthy both inwardly and outwardly. (What serious judgment they deserve according to God's righteousness in His governmental administration!) Hence, they are very contagious, and the believers are prohibited from having contact with them (2 John 9-11). ",
  "8098":"Lit., upon. ",
  "8099":"The words spoken by the prophets are the contents of the Old Testament, the Scriptures (v. 16; 1:20), and the commandments preached by the apostles are the contents of the New Testament, the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). Peter used both to confirm and strengthen his writings as an inoculation against the heretical teachings in the apostasy. In his first Epistle, concerning the full salvation of God, he referred to both the prophets and the apostles (1 Pet. 1:9-12). Then in the second Epistle, concerning the shining of the divine truth, he again referred to both (1:12-21). Here, for the third time, he did the same. ",
  "8100":"See note 1 in 2 Tim. 3. ",
  "8101":"They may be the false teachers mentioned in 2:1. Their mocking was a part of the apostasy. ",
  "8102":"The promise of the Lord's coming was given to the fathers by the holy prophets (v. 2) in the Old Testament (Psa. 72:6-17; 110:1-3; 118:26; Dan. 7:13-14; Zech. 14:3-9; Mal. 4:1-3). ",
  "8103":"The Greek word means presence. ",
  "8104":"Or, this is hidden from them by their own willfulness. I.e., they are willfully ignorant of this; hence, this escapes their notice. The heretical mockers ignore willfully and deny purposely the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures. So Peter reminded the believers to remember the holy words spoken by both the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (vv. 1-2). ",
  "8105":"The promise concerning the Lord's coming (v. 4) is the word of God. The mockers should not ignore that it was by the word of God that the heavens and the earth came into existence (Heb. 11:3) and that it is by the same word that the heavens and the earth are being kept (Heb. 1:3) for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men (v. 7). So the mockers should be assured that by the word of God all the material universe, which includes them, will be judged by the coming of the Lord. ",
  "8106":"In the beginning, that is, of old, the heavens and the earth were created by God (Gen. 1:1). By the word of God (Psa. 33:6) first the heavens came into existence and then the earth (Job 38:4-7). ",
  "8107":"Lit., standing together, standing with (in juxtaposition, side by side). First, in Gen. 1:1 the earth came into existence, and then, in Gen. 1:9, also by the word (the speaking) of God (Psa. 33:9), the earth began to be compacted out of water and through water, that is, to stand together with water in juxtaposition, emerging partly from the water and remaining partly submerged under water. ",
  "8108":"Referring to water in v. 5. The earth was compacted out of water and through water in an orderly condition. But through the same water it was judged and destroyed by the flood at Noah's time (Gen. 7:17-24), indicating that all things did not continue in the same way from the beginning of creation. ",
  "8109":"The Greek word means order, a system, referring here to the world with its inhabitants. The earth in the preceding verse became the world in this verse &#151; not merely the earth, but the earth with its inhabitants in a system. This refers to the world in Noah's age, which was judged by God with the flood because of the sinfulness and ungodliness of that age (Gen. 6:5-7, 11-13, 17). This book is concerned mainly with the divine government and all its judgments. The first judgment on the world was the one executed by the flood in Noah's day, which cleared up that ungodly world. This must have been Peter's thought while he was writing this verse, implying that this age of apostasy will also be judged on the day of the Lord's appearing, as in the day of Noah (Matt. 24:37-39). ",
  "8110":"Then refers to the age of Noah. ",
  "8111":"Referring to the flood of Noah's time (2:5), which caused the earth to be destroyed (Gen. 6:13, 17; 9:11). The earth then did not remain the same but experienced a cataclysm by being flooded with water, and was destroyed. Here Peter argued strongly with the heretical mockers. They said that \"all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation\" (v. 4). But actually a cataclysm did come upon the earth because of the ungodliness of its inhabitants. This implies that the present world will not continue in the same way but will experience another cataclysm through the Lord's coming with His judgment upon the rebellious, including the false teachers and the heretical mockers in the apostasy. ",
  "8112":"I.e., was destroyed, demolished, laid waste (Gen. 6:13, 17). See note 1 point 1, in ch. 2. ",
  "8113":"In contrast to then in v. 6 and referring to the present heavens and earth, which remain by the word of God (Gen. 8:22) and will not be destroyed again by water, according to the covenant God made with Noah (Gen. 9:11), but will be burned by fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. ",
  "8114":"The same word refers to the word of God mentioned in v. 5, which is included in the words of the prophets in the Old Testament. The false and heretical teachings in the apostasy are a deviation from the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Old Testament and the apostles in the New Testament. Hence, the antidote administered through Peter's inoculation against the poison of the apostate teachings was the holy word with the divine revelation, which Peter stressed repeatedly. ",
  "8115":"The fire that will burn up the heavens and the earth (v. 10) at the end of the millennium when the judgment of the great white throne comes (Rev. 20:11). God's initial judgment upon the universe was by water (v. 6), but His consummate judgment will be by fire. Water only washes away the filthiness from the surface, but fire changes the nature of the entire substance. This is another indication that the heavens and the earth will not remain the same as they are but will be cleared up by fire, and that the ungodly false teachers (2:1) and mockers (v. 3) will be judged and destroyed under the divine government. ",
  "8116":"The judgment of the great white throne, which will take place after the millennium and will precede the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 20:11--21:1). Through that judgment all the ungodly will be cast into the lake of fire for destruction (see note 3 in ch. 2). Since it will be the final judgment upon men and the demons (Rev. 20:13 and note), it is of the greatest relevance to the government of God in the universe. See note 17 par. 2, in 1 Pet. 1. <br><br>   Here Peter skipped over the millennium of one thousand years, going directly from the Lord's coming to the judgment of the great white throne. To him, as to the Lord, that one thousand years will be like one day (v. 8), a short time. He was dealing here with God's governmental judgment. In God's economy the millennium is not for that purpose. ",
  "8117":"See note 1 point 2, in ch. 2. ",
  "8118":"Including the false teachers (2:1) and the heretical mockers (v. 3). ",
  "8119":"Or, be hidden from you; i.e., escape your notice. ",
  "8120":"With the Lord God, who is eternal, the sense of time is compressed a thousandfold compared with man's sense of time. Hence, for the fulfillment of His word, especially the word of His promise, the crucial matter is not the time but the fact. Whatever He has promised will sooner or later become a fact. We should not be troubled by the sense of delay according to our reckoning of time. ",
  "8121":"Or, is not tardy. ",
  "8122":"These must be the mockers (v. 3). ",
  "8123":"Or, tardiness. ",
  "8124":"The Lord's heart is set not on the time of the fulfillment of His promise but on His people, whom He possesses peculiarly as a treasure (1 Pet. 2:9; Titus 2:14 and note 3). His desire is that none of us, His precious redeemed ones, would be punished by His governmental judgment but would have a prolonged season to repent that we may be spared from His punishment. ",
  "8125":"Or, be destroyed. See note 1 point 1, in ch. 2. Since you in this verse refers to the believers in Christ, perish refers not to the eternal perdition of the unbelievers but to the punishment of God's governmental disciplining of the believers (1 Pet. 4:17-18 and note 18; 1 Thes. 5:3, 8 and note 3). ",
  "8126":"Referring to the believers. ",
  "8127":"Repentance unto salvation (v. 15), which is to repent for not being watchful for the day of the Lord's coming (v. 10) and not living a life in a holy manner and godliness (v. 11). ",
  "8128":"Mainly in the sense of judgment (1 Thes. 5:2 and note 2) for God's government. ",
  "8129":"The day of the Lord for His judgment (1 Thes. 5:3-4) will come before the millennium (Rev. 18:1; 19:11; 20:4-6). ",
  "8130":"Referring to the day of the Lord. ",
  "8131":"This will take place after the millennium (Rev. 20:7, 11). This indicates again that Peter skipped over the one thousand years of the millennium (see note 7). ",
  "8132":"I.e., a rushing sound or noise. It may be a proclamation of a great change in the universe from the old to the new. ",
  "8133":"The physical elements that compose the heavens. ",
  "8134":"Compare dissolved and burned up with roll them up and changed in Heb. 1:12, fled away and no place was found for them in Rev. 20:11, and passed away in Rev. 21:1. The burning with intense heat to dissolve the heavens and the earth is the procedure God will use to roll up the heavens and the earth and put them away that they may be changed from the old to the new (v. 13; Rev. 21:1). This will be God's final and consummate dealing with His creation in His government. In God's final dealing all the material things will pass away, but His eternal word will abide forever (Matt. 24:35; 1 Pet. 1:25). The word of His prophecy will remain and be fulfilled at His appointed time for the accomplishing of His eternal will, regardless of the change that will occur in the physical universe. ",
  "8135":"This may refer to both God's works of nature and man's works of art. ",
  "8136":"All things, both in the heavens and on the earth, have been defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. Although all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens, have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood (Col. 1:20 and note 4) &#151; even the heavenly things having been purified by the blood of Christ (Heb. 9:23 and note 1) &#151; they will still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God's governmental dealing, that they may become new in nature and appearance in God's new universe (v. 13). Thus, what kind of persons ought we, the children of the holy God, to be in holy manner of life and godliness; that is, what kind of transformation ought we to experience in order to live a life in the manner of God's holy nature and godliness to express Him, that we may be qualified to match His holy government? ",
  "8137":"Some MSS read, therefore are to be dissolved. ",
  "8138":"The divine power has provided us with all things that are needed to live a life in a holy manner and godliness (1:3). ",
  "8139":"While we live a transformed life in a holy and godly manner, we are expecting, awaiting, and hastening the coming of the day of God. ",
  "8140":"The Greek word means presence. ",
  "8141":"The day of God is the day of the Lord (v. 10), and to the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the day of the Lord is the day of Jehovah (Isa. 2:12; Joel 1:15; 2:11, 31; 3:14; Amos 5:18, 20; Obad. 15; Zeph. 1:7, 14, 18; 2:2-3; Zech. 14:1; Mal. 4:1, 5). In such expressions, day is used mainly in the sense of judgment for governmental dealing. Before the Lord comes, it is \"man's day,\" in which man judges until the Lord comes (1 Cor. 4:3-5). Then, it will be \"the day of the Lord,\" which will begin with the Lord's parousia (presence &#151; Matt. 24:3 and note 3) with all its judgments and will end with the judgment upon men and the demons at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15 and notes). The Lord's parousia (presence) will begin when the overcoming saints are raptured to the throne of God in the heavens before the great tribulation of three and a half years (Rev. 12:5-6; 14:1). Then, all the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets will be meted out to smite the earth with the things on it and the heavens with their heavenly bodies (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The great tribulation, which will consist mainly of the woes of the last three trumpets, including the plagues of the seven bowls, will last for three and a half years (Matt. 24:21-22, 29; Rev. 8:13--9:21; 11:14; 15:5--16:21). That will be a time of trial for the inhabitants of the whole earth (Rev. 3:10), including the Jews (Isa. 2:12; Zech. 14:1-2; Mal. 4:1, 5; Joel 1:15-20; 2:1, 11, 31) and the believers in Christ who are left in the tribulation (Rev. 12:17). At the end of the great tribulation, Christ's parousia (presence), with the overcomers, will come to the air (Rev. 10:1), and the dead saints will be resurrected and raptured together with the majority of the living believers, who will have passed through the great tribulation, to meet with the Lord in the air (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16). After this, all the believers will be judged by the Lord at His judgment seat in the air (2 Cor. 5:10). Then the Lord will have His wedding feast with the overcoming saints (Rev. 19:7-8). Immediately after this, the Lord with His bride, composed of the overcoming saints as His army, will come to the earth (Zech. 14:4-5; Jude 14; 1 Thes. 3:13) to fight and defeat Antichrist and his army; they will seize Antichrist and his false prophet and cast them alive into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:11-21). At approximately that time, Babylon the Great will be destroyed (Rev. 17:1--19:3). At the same time, the Lord will deliver, gather, and restore the children of Israel (Zech. 12:2-14; Rom. 11:26; Matt. 24:31; Acts 1:6). Following this, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit (Rev. 20:1-3). Then the Lord will judge the nations (the living &#151; Matt. 25:31-46; Joel 3:2). After this, the millennial kingdom will come (Rev. 20:4-6). After the thousand years, Satan will be loosed from the abyss and will instigate certain of the nations, Gog and Magog in the north of the eastern hemisphere, to carry out the last rebellion against God. They will be subdued and burned, and the deceiving devil will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10). Following this, the heavens and the earth will be fully cleared up by being burned up (vv. 7, 10). Then will come the final judgment upon men (the dead) and the demons, and probably also upon the fallen angels (2:4 and note 4), at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). That will be God's consummate dealing with His old creation in His universal government and will be in addition to so many judgments and dealings executed within the day of the Lord to clear up the old universe. Then a new universe will begin with the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1), in which there will be no more judgment related to God's governmental dealing, for no unrighteousness will dwell there. Therefore, not counting the one thousand years, the day of the Lord will be very short, probably not more than seven years. This will be the main part of the last week (seven years) of the seventy weeks in Dan. 9:24-27. It is unscriptural to consider the day of God and the day of the Lord two different days: the day of the Lord ends with the millennial kingdom, and the day of God begins with the burning of the heavens and the earth, followed by the judgment of the great white throne. Actually, since the judgment of the great white throne will be executed by the Lord Jesus (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1), it too will be in the day of the Lord. God does not judge anyone; He has given all judgment to the Lord (John 5:22). ",
  "8142":"Referring to the coming of the day of God, which is for executing judgment upon every part of the old creation to clear it up. On account of the coming of such a day, the heavens will no longer be able to stand and remain as they have been, but will be dissolved, their elements melting away in the intense heat of the burning fire. ",
  "8143":"After all the material things are dissolved, God's promise as His everlasting word will still exist for His redeemed people to trust in and stand upon with the expectation of a new universe. We should set our hope not on the visible elements but on what the word of God promises for our destiny, that is, the new heavens and new earth, which have not yet come into our view. ",
  "8144":"The new heavens and new earth are the old heavens and old earth renewed and transformed through the burning of God's judging fire, just as the new man is our old man renewed and transformed (Col. 3:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:18). ",
  "8145":"Righteousness is the main factor based on which God's governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation. Hence, in these two books concerning God's government, this matter is stressed repeatedly (1 Pet. 2:23-24; 3:12, 14; 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:1; 2:5, 7-8, 21; 3:13). The main matter seen in John's writings is the love of God expressed in His life; in Paul's writings, the grace of God distributed in His economy; and in Peter's writings, the righteousness of God maintained in His government. God's life, economy, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of the three apostles. Life is of love, economy is through grace, and government is based on righteousness. This righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and new earth, saturating God's new universe prevailingly and thus maintaining it absolutely under God's righteous order, so that no further judgment will ever be needed. ",
  "8146":"Or, makes its home. ",
  "8147":"To be found by the Lord in peace is to be found righteous, right, having no problem in His eyes with either God or man at His coming. Since this book stresses righteousness for God's governmental dealing (see note 13) it charges the believers, who are walking in the ways of righteousness (cf. 2:21), to pursue a living that is in peace, that they may be prepared for the Lord's coming with judgment. ",
  "8148":"The heretics, who forsake the straight way and follow the way of unrighteousness (2:15), are spots and blemishes among the believers (see note 13 in ch. 2); but the believers, who are pursuing to live in peace in God's government, should be without spot and without blemish, like the Lord, who is the Lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Pet. 1:19). ",
  "8149":"The mockers count the Lord's long-suffering toward the believers as delay, tardiness, or slackness (v. 9). This is their twisting of the Lord's word spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures and by the apostles in their teachings (v. 16). Hence, Peter charged the believers to count the Lord's long-suffering as salvation instead of delay, and not to twist the prophets' prophecies or the apostles' teachings, including his own and also Paul's, that they might not be judged unto destruction as the heretics will be at the Lord's coming. It is by doing this and being diligent to be found by the Lord in peace, without spot and without blemish (v. 14), that the believers prepare themselves for the Lord's coming with judgment. ",
  "8150":"The Lord's long-suffering in the delay regarding His promise should be counted as a prolonged opportunity for the believers to repent unto salvation (v. 9 and note 4). ",
  "8151":"Not salvation in its initial stage but salvation in its completing stage (see note 5 in 1 Pet. 1). The Lord's intention in delaying His coming is to prevent many of His elect from missing the topmost portion of His full salvation. ",
  "8152":"It was not only Peter, as one of the apostles (v. 2), who taught, with the confirmation of the prophets' prophecy (v. 2), that the Lord's long-suffering should be counted as salvation instead of delay. Paul, as another of the apostles, taught the same thing in his writings, based on the prophetic word of the Old Testament. Peter referred to this fact to strengthen his writing. ",
  "8153":"Since Peter's antidote to inoculate against the heretical teachings of the apostasy is the holy word spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles, he could not omit the writings of the apostle Paul, which are the greatest part of the apostles' teaching for the constituting of the New Testament. In both his Epistles, which also are a part of the apostles' teaching and are constituents of the New Testament, Peter referred repeatedly to the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (1 Pet. 1:10-12; 2 Pet. 1:12-21; 3:2). Here he referred to the apostle Paul in the strongest way, saying that Paul in all his writings spoke some things that are hard to understand, concerning the things of which Peter spoke in his writing, and that to twist Paul's writings is equivalent to twisting the Scriptures as the heretics do, which results in destruction, that is, in being judged by the Lord at His coming back. This is a strong warning to both the believers and the heretics in the apostasy. ",
  "8154":"In his two Epistles, comprising only eight chapters, Peter covered the entire economy of God, from eternity past before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:2, 20) to the new heavens and new earth in eternity future (2 Pet. 3:13). He unveiled the crucial things related to God's economy, concerning which things the prophets prophesied and the apostles preached (1 Pet. 1:10-12), from four sides: <br><br>   (1) From the side of the Triune God: <br><br>   God the Father chose a people in eternity according to His foreknowledge (1 Pet. 1:1-2; 2:9) and called them into His glory (1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Pet. 1:3). Christ, foreknown by God before the foundation of the world but manifested in the last times (1 Pet. 1:20), has redeemed and saved God's chosen people (1 Pet. 1:18-19, 2) by His vicarious death (1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18) through His resurrection in life and ascension in power (1 Pet. 1:3; 3:21-22). The Spirit, sent from heaven, has sanctified and purified those whom Christ has redeemed (1 Pet. 1:2, 12, 22; 4:14). (The angels long to look into these things &#151; 1 Pet. 1:12.) The Triune God's divine power has provided the redeemed ones with all things that relate to life and godliness (1:3-4) to guard them unto full salvation (1 Pet. 1:5). God also disciplines them (1 Pet. 5:6) by some of His varied governmental judgments (1 Pet. 1:17; 2:23; 4:5-6, 17; 2 Pet. 2:3-4, 9; 3:7), and He will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them by His all grace (1 Pet. 5:10). The Lord is long-suffering toward them that they all may have opportunity to repent unto salvation (vv. 9, 15). Then, Christ will appear in glory with His full salvation for His lovers (1 Pet. 1:5, 7-9, 13; 4:13; 5:4). <br><br>   (2) From the side of the believers: <br><br>   The believers, as God's possession, were chosen by God (1 Pet. 1:1-2; 2:9), called by His glory and virtue (1 Pet. 2:9; 3:9; 2 Pet. 1:3, 10), redeemed by Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19), regenerated by God through His living word (1 Pet. 1:3, 23), and saved through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 3:21). They now are being guarded by the power of God (1 Pet. 1:5), are being purified to love one another (1 Pet. 1:22), are growing by feeding on the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2), are developing in life the spiritual virtues (2 Pet. 1:5-8), and are being transformed and built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to serve God (1 Pet. 2:4-5, 9). They are God's chosen race, royal priesthood, holy nation, and peculiar people for His private possession to express His virtues (1 Pet. 2:9). They are being disciplined by His governmental judgment (1 Pet. 1:17; 2:19-21; 3:9, 14, 17; 4:6, 12-19; 5:6, 9), are living a holy life in an excellent manner and in godliness to glorify Him (1 Pet. 1:15; 2:12; 3:1-2), are ministering as good stewards of His varied grace for His glorification through Christ (1 Pet. 4:10-11) (under the elders' exemplary shepherding &#151; 1 Pet. 5:1-4), and are expecting and hastening the coming of the Lord (1 Pet. 1:13; 2 Pet. 3:12) in order to be richly supplied with an entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord (1:11). Further, they are expecting the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells, in eternity (v. 13), and they are growing continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (v. 18). <br><br>   (3) From the side of Satan: <br><br>   Satan is the believers' adversary, the devil, who as a roaring lion is walking about, seeking someone to devour (1 Pet. 5:8). <br><br>   (4) From the side of the universe: <br><br>   The fallen angels were condemned and are awaiting eternal judgment (2:4); the ancient ungodly world was destroyed by a flood (2:5; 3:6); the ungodly cities were reduced to ashes (2:6); the false teachers and heretical mockers in the apostasy and mankind in his evil living will all be judged unto destruction (2:1, 3, 9-10, 12; 3:3-4, 7; 1 Pet. 4:5); the heavens and the earth will be burned up (vv. 7, 10-11); and all the dead men and the demons will be judged (1 Pet. 4:5). Then the new heavens and new earth will come as a new universe, in which God's righteousness will dwell for eternity (v. 13). <br><br>   Paul in his writings also spoke concerning \"these things\" (except for the new heavens and new earth). Hence, Peter referred to Paul's writings to strengthen his own writings, especially concerning God's governmental and disciplinary judgment upon the believers. Paul strongly and repeatedly emphasized this matter in his writings (1 Cor. 11:30-32; Heb. 12:5-11; 2:3; 4:1; 6:8; 10:27-31, 39; 12:29; 1 Cor. 3:13-15; 4:4-5; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10). This must be the reason Peter highly commended Paul's writings. <br><br>   What beauty and excellency are in this commendation! Although the Corinthians attempted to divide Peter and Paul according to their divisive preferences (1 Cor. 1:11-12), Peter commended Paul, saying that Paul, like him, taught \"these things\" and that Paul's writings should not be twisted but should be regarded like \"the rest of the Scriptures\" and should receive the same respect as the Old Testament. For Peter to make such a commendation was not a small thing, for it was he who was rebuked to his face by Paul regarding the New Testament faith (Gal. 2:11-21). This indicates that Peter was bold in admitting that the early apostles, such as John, Paul, and himself, although their style, terminology, utterance, certain aspects of their views, and the way they presented their teachings differed, participated in the same, unique ministry, the ministry of the New Testament (2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1). Such a ministry ministers to people, as its focus, the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, who, after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, dispenses Himself through the redemption of Christ and by the operation of the Holy Spirit into His redeemed people as their unique portion of life and as their life supply and everything, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the full expression, the fullness, of the Triune God, according to the eternal purpose of the Father. ",
  "8155":"This indicates that the mockers (v. 3) and their followers must have twisted, not merely ignored (v. 5), the Scriptures and the apostles' teaching. ",
  "8156":"See note 1 point 2, in ch. 2. According to the context, destruction here refers not to eternal perdition but to the punishment of the divine governmental discipline. See notes 18 in 1 Pet. 4 and 9 in this chapter. ",
  "8157":"Be on your guard because of the apostasy, the heretical teachings, which may carry you away to destruction by twisting the apostles' writings or the Scriptures (v. 16). ",
  "8158":"The same word as that used in Gal. 2:13 concerning Peter, Barnabas, and other Jewish believers. ",
  "8159":"See note 7 in ch. 2. The lawless must refer to the false teachers and mockers (2:1; 3:3), who were the early heretics. ",
  "8160":"This is to become unstable (v. 16). ",
  "8161":"This indicates that what Peter wrote in his two Epistles is a matter of life. To grow in grace is to grow by the bountiful supply of eternal life provided by the divine power (1:3-4), and to grow in the knowledge of the Lord is to grow by the realization of what Christ is. This is to grow by the enjoyment of grace and the realization of truth (John 1:14 and note 6, 17 and note 1). ",
  "8162":"See notes 14 in John 1, 10 in 1 Cor. 15, and 14 in 2 Cor. 13. ",
  "8163":"The realization of the knowledge of our Lord equals truth, the reality of all that He is, as in John 1:14, 17 (see note 17 there). Peter charged the believers to grow not only in grace but also in this truth. ",
  "8164":"Referring to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Since such a praise is one that is rendered to our God (Rom. 11:36; 16:27), it indicates that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is God. ",
  "8165":"Paul's ministry was to complete the divine revelation (Col. 1:25-27) of God's New Testament economy, that is, the Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit producing the members of Christ for the constituting and the building up of the Body of Christ, that the Triune God may have a full expression &#151; the fullness of God (Eph. 1:23; 3:19) &#151; in the universe. Paul's writings were completed around A.D. 67. Paul's completing ministry was damaged by the apostasy preceding and following his death. Then after a quarter of a century, around A.D. 90, John's writings came forth. John's ministry was not only to mend the broken ministry of Paul but also to consummate the entire divine revelation of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, of both the Gospels and the Epistles. In such a ministry, the focus is the mysteries of the divine life. John's Gospel, as the consummation of the Gospels, unveils the mysteries of the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. John's Epistles (especially the first), as the consummation of the Epistles, unfold the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life, which is the fellowship of God's children with God the Father and with one another. Then John's Revelation, as the consummation of the New Testament and the Old Testament, reveals the mystery of Christ as the life supply to God's children for His expression and as the center of the universal administration of the Triune God. Here John used the expression that which to open his Epistle and unfold the mystery of the fellowship in the divine life. That he did not use personal pronouns in reference to the Lord implies that what he was about to unfold is mysterious. ",
  "8166":"This differs from in the beginning in John's Gospel (John 1:1). In the beginning traces back to eternity past before creation; from the beginning proceeds forward from the creation. This indicates that John's Epistle is a continuation of his Gospel, which concerns the believers' experience of the divine life. In his Gospel, John revealed the way for sinners to receive the eternal life &#151; to believe in the Son of God. In his Epistle he pointed out the way for the believers, who have received the divine life, to enjoy that life in its fellowship &#151; to abide in the Son of God. And in his Revelation he unveiled the consummation of the eternal life as the believers' full enjoyment in eternity. <br><br>   The phrase from the beginning is used four times in the Gospel of John, eight times in this Epistle, and twice in 2 John. In John 8:44; 1 John 1:1; 2:13-14; and 3:8, it is used in the absolute sense; whereas in John 6:64; 15:27; 16:4; 1 John 2:7, 24 (twice); 3:11; and 2 John 5-6, it is used in the relative sense. ",
  "8167":"Gazed at with a purpose. ",
  "8168":"First, have heard, then have seen; after having seen, beheld, gazed at with a purpose, and handled, touched with hands. These expressions indicate that the Word of life is not only mysterious but also tangible, because He was incarnated. The mysterious Word of life was touched by man, not only in His humanity before His resurrection (Mark 3:10; 5:31) but also in His spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:44) after His resurrection (John 20:17, 27). At that time there was a heresy that denied the incarnation of the Son of God (4:1-3). Hence, such strong expressions to indicate the Lord's solid substance in His touchable humanity were needed. ",
  "8169":"This is the Word mentioned in John 1:1-4, 14, who was with God and was God in eternity before creation, who became flesh in time, and in whom is life. This Word is the divine person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is. In Him is life, and He is life (John 11:25; 14:6). The phrase the Word of life in Greek indicates that the Word is life. The person is the divine life, the eternal life, which we can touch. The mentioning of the Word here indicates that this Epistle is a continuation and development of John's Gospel (cf. John 1:1-2, 14). ",
  "8170":"The writings of John are books of mysteries. In this Epistle, life, that is, the divine life, the eternal life, the life of God, which is imparted into the believers in Christ and is abiding in them, is the first mystery (v. 2; 2:25; 3:15; 5:11, 13, 20). Issuing out of this mystery is another mystery, the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life (vv. 3-7). After that is the mystery of the anointing of the Triune God (2:20-27). Then there is the mystery of abiding in the Lord (2:27-28; 3:6, 24). The fifth mystery is the mystery of the divine birth (2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18). The sixth is the divine seed (3:9). And the last is the water, the blood, and the Spirit (5:6-12). ",
  "8171":"This indicates that life is a synonym for Word of life in the preceding verse. Both denote the divine person of Christ, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation, and whom the apostles saw and testified and reported to the believers. ",
  "8172":"This manifestation of the eternal life was through Christ's incarnation, which John stressed strongly in his Gospel (John 1:14) as an antidote to inoculate the believers against the heresy that said that Christ did not come in the flesh. Such a manifestation, corresponding with being touchable, indicates again the substantial nature of the Lord's humanity, which is the manifestation of the divine life in the New Testament economy. ",
  "8173":"Lit., the life the eternal. This life denotes the divine spiritual life, not the human soulish life or the physical life (see note 17 in Rom. 5). Eternal denotes not only duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. The apostles saw this eternal life and testified and reported it to people. Their experience was not of any doctrine but of Christ, the Son of God, as the eternal life, and their testimony and preaching were not of theology or biblical knowledge but of such a solid life. ",
  "8174":"The Greek word implies living and acting in union and communion with. The eternal life, which is the Son, not only was with the Father but also was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity. This word corresponds with John 1:1-2. ",
  "8175":"The Father is the source of the eternal life; from Him and with Him the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for the people of the Father's choice to partake of and enjoy. ",
  "8176":"The manifestation of the eternal life includes the revelation and impartation of life to men, with a view to bringing man into the eternal life, into its union and communion with the Father. ",
  "8177":"In v. 1 it was first have heard and then have seen; here it is vice versa. In our receiving of revelation, hearing is the basic thing; in our preaching, in our reporting, seeing should be the base. What we preach should be our apprehension and experience of the things we have heard. ",
  "8178":"The apostles heard and saw the eternal life. Then they reported it to the believers that the believers also might hear and see it. By virtue of the eternal life, the apostles enjoyed fellowship with the Father and with His Son, the Lord Jesus. They desired that the believers also enjoy this fellowship. ",
  "8179":"The Greek word means joint participation, common participation. Fellowship is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1). All genuine believers are in this fellowship (Acts 2:42). It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called \"the fellowship of the Holy Spirit\" (2 Cor. 13:14) and \"fellowship of [our] spirit\" (Phil. 2:1). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). Such a fellowship was first the apostles' portion in their enjoyment of the Father and the Son through the Spirit. Hence, in Acts 2:42 it is called \"the fellowship of the apostles,\" and in this verse \"our [the apostles'] fellowship,\" a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. It is a divine mystery. This mysterious fellowship of the eternal life should be considered the subject of this Epistle. <br><br>   Fellowship here indicates a putting away of private interests and a joining with others for a certain common purpose. Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles' fellowship is to put aside our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God's purpose. This purpose, according to John's subsequent writings, is twofold: (1) that the believers grow in the divine life by abiding in the Triune God (2:12-27) and, based on the divine birth, live a life of the divine righteousness and the divine love (2:28--5:3) to overcome the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols (5:4-21); and (2) that the local churches be built up as the lampstands for the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1--3) and consummate in the New Jerusalem as the full expression of God for eternity (Rev. 21--22). Our participation in the apostles' enjoyment of the Triune God is our joining with them and with the Triune God for His divine purpose, which is common to God, the apostles, and all the believers. ",
  "8180":"Only the Father and the Son are mentioned here, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship. Actually, the fellowship of the eternal life is the imparting of the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; into the believers as their unique portion for them to enjoy today and for eternity. ",
  "8181":"Some MSS read, your. The apostles' joy is also the believers' joy, because the believers are in the fellowship of the apostles. ",
  "8182":"Fellowship is the issue of the eternal life, and joy, that is, the enjoyment of the Triune God, is the issue of this fellowship, the issue of participation in the Father's love and the Son's grace through the Spirit. By such a spiritual enjoyment of the divine life, our joy in our Triune God can be made full. ",
  "8183":"In addition to the three main things &#151; life, fellowship, and joy &#151; presented in the preceding verses, a further message, which the apostles heard from the Lord, is to announce to the believers that God is light. ",
  "8184":"In the preceding verses the Father and the Son are mentioned in plain words, and the Spirit is implied in the fellowship of the eternal life. Here God is mentioned for the first time in this Epistle, and He is mentioned as the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This God, as revealed in the light of the gospel, is light. <br><br>   The message that John and the other early disciples heard was, undoubtedly, the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in John 8:12 and 9:5 &#151; that He is the light. However, John said here that the message was that God is light. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is God, implying the essence of the Divine Trinity. ",
  "8185":"Expressions such as God is light, God is love (4:8, 16), and God is Spirit (John 4:24) are used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense. They denote and describe the nature of God. In His nature, God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit and Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth. John's Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus brought grace and truth to us (John 1:14, 17) that we might have the divine life (John 3:14-16), whereas John's Epistle unveils that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the very source of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light. John's Epistle is the continuation of his Gospel. In John's Gospel it is God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children (John 1:12-13); in John's Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father's life, going to the Father to participate in His love and light (see note 8 in ch. 4). The former was God's coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar (Lev. 4:28-31); the latter is our entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the ark (Exo. 25:22). This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life. After receiving the divine life by believing into the Son in John's Gospel, we should go on to enjoy this life through the fellowship of this life in John's Epistle. The entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life through our abiding in its fellowship. ",
  "8186":"As light is the nature of God in His expression, so darkness is the nature of Satan in his evil works (3:8). Thank God that He has delivered us out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9). The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it (John 1:4-5). When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness (John 8:12), which, according to the context, is the darkness of sin (vv. 7-10). ",
  "8187":"To have fellowship with God is to have intimate and living contact with Him in the flow of the divine life according to the Spirit's anointing in our spirit (2:27). This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine light and the divine love. ",
  "8188":"According to the context, with Him denotes with God and equals with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (v. 3). Here again the Divine Trinity is implied. ",
  "8189":"Referring to our walk in general in our living; i.e., live, behave, and have our being. So in the next verse. See note 16 in Gal. 5. To walk in the darkness, that is, to walk habitually in the darkness, is to live, behave, and have one's being in the nature of Satan's evil works. According to 2:11, walking in the darkness equals practicing sin (3:4, 8). ",
  "8190":"Lying is of Satan; he is the father of liars (John 8:44 and note 3). The satanic darkness is versus the divine light, and the satanic lie is versus the divine truth. As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness. If we say that we have fellowship with God, who is light, and walk in the darkness, we lie in the expression of the satanic darkness and do not practice the truth in the expression of the divine light. This verse inoculates against the heretical teaching of the Antinomians, who taught that one is free from the obligation of the moral law and said that one can live in sin and at the same time have fellowship with God. ",
  "8191":"This Greek verb denotes doing (things) habitually and continually by abiding (in the things); hence, it has the sense of practice. It is used also in 2:17, 29; 3:4 (twice), 7, 8, 9, 10, 22; 5:2; Rom. 1:32; and elsewhere. To practice the truth is to live the truth habitually, not merely to do it occasionally. ",
  "8192":"The Greek word means reality (the opposite of vanity), verity, veracity, genuineness, sincerity. It is John's highly individual terminology, and it is one of the profound words in the New Testament, denoting all the realities of the divine economy as the content of the divine revelation, conveyed and disclosed by the holy Word as follows: <br><br>   (1) God, who is light and love, incarnated to be the reality of the divine things, such as the divine life, the divine nature, the divine power, and the divine glory, for us to possess, that we may enjoy Him as grace, as revealed in John's Gospel (John 1:1, 4, 14-17). <br><br>   (2) Christ, who is God incarnated and in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:9), as the reality of (a) God and man (John 1:18, 51; 1 Tim. 2:5); (b) all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament (Col. 2:16-17; John 4:23, 24, and notes); and (c) all the divine and spiritual things, such as the divine life and resurrection (John 11:25; 14:6), the divine light (John 8:12; 9:5), the divine way (John 14:6), wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). Hence, Christ is the reality (John 14:6; Eph. 4:21). <br><br>   (3) The Spirit, who is Christ transfigured (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17), as the reality of Christ (John 14:16-17; 15:26) and of the divine revelation (John 16:13-15). Hence, the Spirit is the reality (5:6). <br><br>   (4) The Word of God as the divine revelation, which not only reveals but also conveys the reality of God and Christ and of all the divine and spiritual things. Hence, the Word of God also is reality (John 17:17 and note 3). <br><br>   (5) The contents of the faith (belief), which are the substantial elements of what we believe, as the reality of the full gospel (Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5); these are revealed throughout the New Testament (2 Cor. 4:2; 13:8; Gal. 5:7; 1 Tim. 1:1, note 1, points 1 and 2; 1 Tim. 2:4 and note 2; 1 Tim. 2:7b; 1 Tim. 3:15 and note 5; 1 Tim. 4:3; 1 Tim. 6:5; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7, 8; 4:4; Titus 1:1, 14; 2 Thes. 2:10, 12; Heb. 10:26; James 5:19; 1 Pet. 1:22; 2 Pet. 1:12). <br><br>   (6) The reality concerning God, the universe, man, man's relationship with God and with his fellow man, and man's obligation to God, as revealed through creation and the Scriptures (Rom. 1:18-20; 2:2, 8, 20). <br><br>   (7) The genuineness, truthfulness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness of God as a divine virtue (Rom. 3:7; 15:8) and of man as a human virtue (Mark 12:14; 2 Cor. 11:10; Phil. 1:18; 1 John 3:18), and as an issue of the divine reality (John 4:23-24; 2 John 1a; 3 John 1). <br><br>   (8) Things that are true or real, the true or real state of affairs (facts), reality, veracity, as the opposite of falsehood, deception, dissimulation, hypocrisy, and error (Mark 5:33; 12:32; Luke 4:25; John 16:7; Acts 4:27; 10:34; 26:25; Rom. 1:25; 9:1; 2 Cor. 6:7; 7:14; 12:6; Col. 1:6; 1 Tim. 2:7a). <br><br>   Of the eight points listed above, the first five refer to the same reality in essence. God, Christ, and the Spirit &#151; the Divine Trinity &#151; are essentially one. Hence, these three, being the basic elements of the substance of the divine reality, are actually one reality. This one divine reality is the substance of the Word of God as the divine revelation. Hence, it becomes the revealed divine reality in the divine Word and makes the divine Word the reality. The divine Word conveys this one divine reality as the contents of the faith, and the contents of the faith are the substance of the gospel revealed in the entire New Testament as its reality, which is just the divine reality of the Divine Trinity. When this divine reality is partaken of and enjoyed by us, it becomes our genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as an excellent virtue in our behavior that enables us to express God, the God of reality, by whom we live; and we become persons living a life of truth, without any falsehood or hypocrisy, a life that corresponds with the truth revealed through creation and the Scripture. <br><br>   The word truth is used in the New Testament more than one hundred times. Its denotation in each occurrence is determined by its context. For instance, in John 3:21, according to the context, it denotes uprightness (the opposite of evil &#151; John 3:19-20), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ. In John 4:23-24, according to the context of that chapter and also according to the entire revelation of John's Gospel, it denotes the divine reality becoming man's genuineness and sincerity (the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper &#151; John 4:16-18) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ, who is the reality (John 14:6), as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God (John 1:29; 3:14) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit (John 4:7-15), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity, in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks. In John 5:33 and 18:37, according to the entire revelation of the Gospel of John, truth denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. In John 8:32, 40, 44-46, according to the context of that chapter, it denotes the reality of God revealed in His word (John 8:47) and embodied in Christ, the Son of God (John 8:36), which sets us free from the bondage of sin (see note 32 in John 8). <br><br>   Here in v. 6, truth denotes the revealed reality of God in its aspect of the divine light. It is the issue and realization of the divine light mentioned in v. 5. The divine light is the source in God; truth is the issue and realization of the divine light in us (see note 8 in ch. 4; cf. John 3:19-21). When we abide in the divine light, which we enjoy in the fellowship of the divine life, we practice the truth &#151; what we have realized in the divine light. When we abide in the source, its issue becomes our practice. ",
  "8193":"We walk in the light, but God is in the light because He is light. \"The light is the element in which God dwells: compare 1 Tim. 6:16. ... this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God's eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life\" (Alford). ",
  "8194":"When we walk and live in the light of God, we have the joint enjoyment of the Triune God and the joint participation in His divine purpose. The fellowship of the divine life brings us the divine light, and the divine light keeps us in the fellowship, that is, in the joint enjoyment of God and the joint participation in His purpose. ",
  "8195":"When we live in the divine light, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God's divine nature and through God's nature in us, all our sins, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained. Our relationship with God is unbreakable, yet our fellowship with Him can be interrupted. The former is of life, whereas the latter is based on our living, though it also is of life. One is unconditional; the other is conditional. Our fellowship, which is conditional, needs to be maintained by the constant cleansing of the Lord's blood. <br><br>   In this section of the Word there is a cycle in our spiritual life, a cycle formed of four crucial things &#151; the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in its fellowship, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus the Son of God that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity of life. ",
  "8196":"The name Jesus denotes the Lord's humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord's divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man shed for the redeeming of God's fallen creatures, with the divine surety as its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. <br><br>   The title Jesus His Son is also used by John as an inoculation against the heresies concerning the Lord's person. One of the heresies insisted on the divinity of the Lord by denying His humanity. The title Jesus as the name of a man inoculates against this heresy. Another heresy insisted on the humanity of the Lord by denying His divinity. The title His Son as a name of the Deity is an antidote to this heresy. ",
  "8197":"The tense of this verb in Greek is present and denotes continuous action, indicating that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing here refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord's blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (Heb. 9:12, 14), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, so that that cleansing need not be repeated. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord's blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God. This instant cleansing is typified by the purification with the water of impurity mixed with the ashes of the heifer (Num. 19:2-10). ",
  "8198":"The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin (singular) and the word sins (plural). Sin refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan (Rom. 5:12). It is dealt with in the second section of Romans, 5:12--8:13 (with the exception of 7:5, where sins is mentioned). Sins refers to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18--5:11. However, in this verse sin in the singular, used with the adjective every, does not denote the indwelling sin but every single sin we commit (v. 10) after we are regenerated; each such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God. <br><br>   Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature (Rom. 7:17), has been dealt with by Christ as our sin offering (Lev. 4; Isa. 53:10; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26). Our sins, our trespasses, have been dealt with by Christ as our trespass offering (Lev. 5; Isa. 53:11; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28). However, after our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sin in our nature as indicated in v. 8, and as our trespass offering for the sins in our conduct as indicated in v. 9. ",
  "8199":"I.e., do not have the indwelling sin (Rom. 7:17) within our nature. This was what the Gnostic heresy taught. The apostle was inoculating the believers against this false teaching. This section, 1:7--2:2, deals with the believers' sinning after their regeneration. Such sinning interrupts their fellowship with God. If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct? Even if they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is adequate proof that they still have sin working within them. Otherwise, there would be no interruption in their fellowship with God. The apostle's teaching here also condemns today's teaching of perfectionism, which says that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in this earthly life; and it annuls today's erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, misinterpreting the word in 3:9 and 5:18, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because their sinful nature has been totally eradicated. ",
  "8200":"Or, we are leading ourselves astray. To say that because we have been regenerated we do not have sin is to deceive ourselves and to deny the actual fact of our own experience; thus we lead ourselves astray. ",
  "8201":"Truth denotes the revealed reality of God, the real facts, conveyed in the gospel, such as the reality of God and all the divine things, which are all Christ (John 1:14, 17; 14:6); the reality of Christ and all the spiritual things, which are all the Spirit (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6); and the reality of man's condition (John 16:8-11). See note 6. Here, it denotes especially the reality of our sinful condition after regeneration, exposed under the enlightening of the divine light in our fellowship with God. If we say that we do not have sin after being regenerated, such a reality, the truth, does not remain in us; that is, we deny the true condition after our regeneration. ",
  "8202":"This denotes the confessing of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confessing of our sins before regeneration. ",
  "8203":"God is faithful in His word (v. 10) and righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son (v. 7). His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43); and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He might forgive us our sins (Matt. 26:28). If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus; otherwise, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. Our confession is needed for His forgiveness. Such forgiveness of God, which is for the restoration of our fellowship with Him, is conditional; it depends on our confession. ",
  "8204":"To forgive us is to release us from the offense of our sins, whereas to cleanse us is to wash us from the stain of our unrighteousness. ",
  "8205":"Unrighteousness and sins are synonyms. All unrighteousness is sin (5:17). Both refer to our wrongdoings. Sins indicates the offense of our wrongdoings against God and men; unrighteousness indicates the stain of our wrongdoings, which causes us not to be right with either God or men. The offense needs God's forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing. Both God's forgiveness and God's cleansing are needed for the restoration of our broken fellowship with God, that we may enjoy Him in uninterrupted fellowship with a good conscience, a conscience void of offense (1 Tim. 1:5; Acts 24:16). ",
  "8206":"Verse 8 proves that after our regeneration we still have sin inwardly. Verse 10 proves further that we even still sin outwardly, though not habitually. We still sin outwardly in our conduct because we still have sin inwardly in our nature. Both confirm our sinful condition after regeneration. In speaking of such a condition, the apostle used the pronoun we, not excluding himself. ",
  "8207":"The word of God's revelation, which is the word of truth (Eph. 1:13; John 17:17) and which conveys the contents of God's New Testament economy. It is synonymous with truth in v. 8. In this word God exposes our true condition, which is sinful both before and after regeneration. If we say that after regeneration we have not sinned, we make God a liar and deny the word of His revelation. ",
  "8208":"The Greek word for little children was often used by older persons in addressing younger ones. \"It is a term of parental affection. It applies to Christians irrespective of growth. Used in vv. 12, 28; 3:7, 18; 4:4; 5:21; John 13:33; Gal. 4:19\" (Darby). The aged apostle considered all the recipients of his Epistle his dear little children in the Lord. In vv. 13-27 he classified them into three groups: young children, young men, and fathers. Verses 1-12 and 28-29 are addressed to all the recipients in general, and vv. 13-27 to the three groups respectively, according to their growth in the divine life. ",
  "8209":"The things mentioned in 1:5-10 regarding the committing of sin by the children of God, the regenerated believers, who have the divine life and participate in its fellowship (1:1-4). ",
  "8210":"This word and if anyone sins in the succeeding sentence indicate that the regenerated believers can still sin. Though they possess the divine life, it is still possible for them to sin if they do not live by the divine life and abide in its fellowship. ",
  "8211":"Aorist subjunctive, denoting a single act, not habitual action. ",
  "8212":"The Greek word refers to one who is called to another's side to aid him; hence, a helper. It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation; hence, a consoler, a comforter. It is used in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs (see note 16 in John 14). It is used here in reference to the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father. When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding (Rom. 8:34) and pleading for us. ",
  "8213":"See note 2 in ch. 1. The Lord Jesus as our Advocate is living in communion with the Father. ",
  "8214":"Here this divine title indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father. Through regeneration we have been born children of God. After regeneration, if we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father. Our Advocate, who is the sacrifice for our propitiation, undertakes for us to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship. ",
  "8215":"Our Lord Jesus is the only righteous man among all men. His righteous act (Rom. 5:18) on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners. Only He is qualified to be our Advocate, to care for us in our sinning condition and restore us to a righteous condition that the relationship between us and our Father, who is righteous, may be appeased. ",
  "8216":"I.e., the sacrifice for propitiation. See note 25 in Rom. 3. The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for the satisfying of God's demand, thus appeasing the relationship between us and God. Hence, He is the sacrifice for our propitiation before God. ",
  "8217":"The Lord Jesus is a sacrifice for propitiation, not only for our sins but also for the whole world. However, this propitiation is conditioned on man's receiving the Lord by believing in Him. The unbelievers do not experience its efficacy, not because it has any fault but because they do not believe. ",
  "8218":"Verses 1-2 are a conclusion to the word in 1:5-10 regarding our confessing and God's forgiving of our sins, which interrupt our fellowship with Him. That is the first condition of &#151; the first requirement for &#151; our enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life. Verses 3-11 deal with the second condition of &#151; the second requirement for &#151; our fellowship with God: that we keep the Lord's word and love the brothers. ",
  "8219":"Or, perceive; not doctrinally but experientially by keeping His commandments. ",
  "8220":"Lit., have come to know Him; denoting that we have begun to know Him and that we continue to know Him until the present time. This refers to our experiential knowledge of God in our daily walk and is related to our intimate fellowship with Him. ",
  "8221":"See note 34 in John 13. So throughout the book. ",
  "8222":"See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8223":"Denoting the revealed reality of God as conveyed in the divine word (see note 6 in ch. 1), which reveals that our keeping the Lord's commandments should follow our knowing Him. If we say that we have known the Lord, yet we are not keeping His commandments, the truth (reality) is not in us, and we become liars. ",
  "8224":"Word is synonymous with commandments in vv. 3-4. The word here comprises all the commandments. Commandments emphasizes injunction; word implies spirit and life as a supply to us (John 6:63). ",
  "8225":"The Greek word denotes the love that is higher and nobler than human affection (see notes 7 and 7 in 2 Pet. 1). Only this word with its verb forms is used in this Epistle for love. Here the love of God denotes our love toward God, which is generated by His love within us. The love of God, the word of the Lord, and God Himself are all related to one another. If we keep the Lord's word, God's love has been perfected in us. It is altogether a matter of the divine life, which is God Himself. God's love is His inward essence, and the Lord's word supplies us with this divine essence, with which we love the brothers. Hence, when we keep the divine word, the divine love is perfected through the divine life, by which we live. ",
  "8226":"See note 12 in ch. 4. ",
  "8227":"I.e., in the Lord Jesus Christ (v. 1). This is a strong expression, stressing that we are one with the Lord. Since we are one with the Lord, who is God, the loving essence of God becomes ours. It is supplied to us by the Lord's word of life for our walk of love that we may enjoy the fellowship of the divine life and abide in the divine light (v. 10). ",
  "8228":"To be in Christ is the beginning of the Christian life. Our being put in Christ was God's doing once for all (1 Cor. 1:30). To abide in Christ is the continuation of the Christian life. This is our responsibility in our daily walk, a walk that is a copy of Christ's walk on earth. See note 27. ",
  "8229":"Lit., that One; referring to Jesus Christ. ",
  "8230":"The commandment given by the Lord in John 13:34, which is the word the believers heard and had from the beginning. ",
  "8231":"This phrase is in the relative sense. See note 1 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "8232":"The commandment regarding brotherly love is both old and new: old, because the believers have had it from the beginning of their Christian life; new, because in their Christian walk it dawns with new light and shines with new enlightenment and fresh power again and again. ",
  "8233":"This relative pronoun, in the neuter gender, does not refer to commandment, which is in the feminine gender. It should refer to the fact that the old commandment regarding brotherly love is new in the believers' Christian walk. That the old commandment is new is true in the Lord, since He not only gave it to His believers but also renews it in their daily walk continually. It is true also in the believers, since they not only have received it once for all but also are enlightened and refreshed by it repeatedly. ",
  "8234":"The passing away of the darkness is its vanishing in the shining of the true light. The true light is the light of the Lord's commandment. Because this light shines, the commandment regarding brotherly love dawns in the darkness, making the old commandment always new and fresh in our entire Christian living. ",
  "8235":"Light is the expression of God's essence and the source of truth (see note 5 in ch. 1). The divine love is related to the divine light. It is versus the satanic hatred, which is related to the satanic darkness. Hating a brother in the Lord is a sign of being in darkness (v. 11). Likewise, loving a brother is a sign of abiding in the light (v. 10). Love causes us to abide in the light, and light causes us to love the brothers. ",
  "8236":"Abiding in the light depends on abiding in the Lord (v. 6), from which issues love toward the brothers. ",
  "8237":"See note 9. ",
  "8238":"See note 9. ",
  "8239":"The Greek word means to go away. ",
  "8240":"In John 12:35, 40 darkness is the issue of blinding; here it is vice versa. ",
  "8241":"See note 1. ",
  "8242":"The forgiveness of sins is the basic element of God's gospel (Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38). Through this, the believers who receive Christ are regenerated and become the children of God (John 1:12-13). ",
  "8243":"The believers who are mature in the divine life. They are classified by the apostle as the first group among his recipients. ",
  "8244":"The Greek verb is in the perfect tense, denoting that the state produced continues: you have known; therefore, you know all the time. Such living knowledge is the fruit of the experience of life. ",
  "8245":"The eternal, preexisting Christ, who is the Word of life from the beginning (1:1; John 1:1). Knowing in the way of life such an eternal Christ is the characteristic of the mature and experienced fathers, who were not and could not be deceived by the heresies that said that Christ was not eternal as the Father is. Knowing Christ as the eternal One who is from the beginning will cause us to mature and not be deceived by the heresies of modernism. ",
  "8246":"In the absolute sense. See note 1 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "8247":"The believers who are grown up in the divine life. They are classified by the apostle as the second group of his recipients. ",
  "8248":"Overcoming the evil one is the characteristic of the grown-up and strong young believers, who are nourished, strengthened, and sustained by the word of God, which is abiding and operating in them against the devil, the world, and the lust of the world (vv. 14b-17). ",
  "8249":"Satan, the devil. See note 19 in ch. 5. ",
  "8250":"The Greek word denotes have written; in other MSS, write. Although have written is more authentic according to a more recent discovery of MSS, write, which is used by the KJV and J. N. Darby's New Translation, is more logical according to the context. The apostle in this verse addressed his writing to each of the three classes of his recipients, always in the present tense. In the succeeding verses, 14-27, he addressed each of the three classes again, but always in the aorist tense (v. 14, to the fathers and young men; v. 26, cf. v. 18, to the young children). ",
  "8251":"The believers who have just received the divine life. They are classified by the apostle as the third group of recipients. ",
  "8252":"The Father is the source of the divine life; of Him the believers have been reborn (John 1:12-13). To know the Father is the initial issue of being regenerated (John 17:3, 6). Hence, such an experiential knowledge in the youth of the divine life is the basic qualification of the young children, who are the youngest in John's classification. ",
  "8253":"Although the Greek here is in the aorist tense, it does not indicate that any previous Epistle was written by the apostle to these same recipients. It means that he was repeating what he wrote to them in the preceding verse to strengthen and develop what he said. Hence, it indicates have written. ",
  "8254":"This word, ending with abides in you, strengthens the word you have overcome, which was written in the previous verse to the young men. ",
  "8255":"See note 19 in ch. 5. ",
  "8256":"Verses 15-17 are the development of the word written in v. 13 to the young men. ",
  "8257":"The Greek word is used for different things, as follows: In Matt. 25:34; John 17:5; Acts 17:24; Eph. 1:4; and Rev. 13:8, it denotes the material universe as a system created by God. In John 1:29; 3:16; and Rom. 5:12, it denotes the fallen human race, corrupted and usurped by Satan to be the components of his evil world system. In 1 Pet. 3:3 it denotes adorning, ornaments. Here, as in John 15:19; 17:14; and James 4:4, it denotes an order, a set form, an orderly arrangement, hence, an ordered system (set up by Satan, the adversary of God), not the earth. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy, Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, formed an anti-God world system on this earth by systematizing men with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, entertainment, etc., through men's fallen nature, in their lusts, pleasures, and pursuits, and even in their indulgence in necessities for their living, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation (see note 31 in John 12). The whole of such a satanic system lies in the evil one (5:19). Not loving such a world is the ground for overcoming the evil one. Loving it just a little gives the evil one the ground to defeat and occupy us. ",
  "8258":"Lit., the love of the Father; referring to the Father's love within us, which becomes our love toward Him. To love Him with such a love is to love Him with the love with which He has loved us and which is enjoyed by us. ",
  "8259":"The world is against the Father, the devil is against the Son (3:8), and the flesh is against the Spirit (Gal. 5:17). ",
  "8260":"The lust of the flesh is the passionate desire of the body; the lust of the eyes is the passionate desire of the soul through the eyes; and the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, and display of material things, of the present life. These are the components of the world. ",
  "8261":"The Greek word denotes physical life, referring here to the present life; it differs from the word for life in 1:1-2, which refers to the divine life. ",
  "8262":"As the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world (v. 15), which constitute its lust, are against the will of God. The lust of the world, along with him who loves the world, is passing away, but he who does the will of God abides forever. ",
  "8263":"See note 6 in ch. 1. I.e., does the will of God habitually and continually, not just occasionally. ",
  "8264":"Referring to the young children in v. 13 as the third class of recipients. Verses 18-27, stressing the knowledge in life (vv. 20-21), strengthen the word \"because you know the Father,\" spoken to this class in v. 13. ",
  "8265":"An antichrist differs from a false Christ (Matt. 24:5, 24). A false Christ is one who pretends, deceivingly, to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ's deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 22 and note 2; v. 23), not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit (4:2-3). ",
  "8266":"At the apostle's time many heretics, such as the Gnostics, the Cerinthians, and the Docetists, taught heresies concerning the person of Christ, that is, concerning His divinity and humanity. ",
  "8267":"These antichrists were not born of God and were not in the fellowship of the apostles and the believers (1:3; Acts 2:42); hence, they were not of the church, that is, of the Body of Christ. ",
  "8268":"To remain with the apostles and the believers is to remain in the fellowship of the Body of Christ. ",
  "8269":"The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit, who is fully typified by the anointing oil, the compound ointment, in Exo. 30:23-25 (see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-166, and note 19 in Phil. 1). This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever (v. 27); by Him the young children know the Father (v. 13) and know the truth (v. 21). ",
  "8270":"Some MSS read, you know all things. ",
  "8271":"Denoting the reality of the Divine Trinity, especially of the person of Christ (vv. 22-25), as taught by the divine anointing (vv. 20, 27). See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8272":"This knowing is by the anointing of the indwelling and life-giving Spirit. It is a knowledge in the divine life under the divine light, an inner knowledge that originates with our regenerated spirit, indwelt by the compound Spirit; it is not mental knowledge produced by outward stimulation. ",
  "8273":"This is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent educated at Alexandria. His heresy was a mixture of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Christianity. He separated the maker (creator) of the world from God and represented that maker as a subordinate power. He taught adoptionism, saying that Jesus was merely God's adopted Son and had become the Son of God by being exalted to a status that was not His by birth; thus he denied that Jesus had been conceived by the Holy Spirit. In his heresy he separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ and taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him, and then He announced the unknown Father and did miracles. Further, he taught that at the end of His ministry Christ departed from Jesus, and Jesus suffered death on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separate as a spiritual being, and, finally, that Christ will rejoin the man Jesus at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory. ",
  "8274":"To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31). Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Whoever so denies the divine person of Christ is the antichrist. <br><br>   The fact that denying that Jesus is the Christ equals denying the Father and the Son implies the thought that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one. They all are the elements, the ingredients, of the all-inclusive compound indwelling Spirit, who is now anointing the believers all the time (vv. 20, 27). In this anointing, Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all anointed into our inner being. ",
  "8275":"Since the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; Isa. 9:6), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. Here to deny the Son is to deny the deity of Christ, to deny that the man Jesus is God. This is a great heresy. ",
  "8276":"The Word of life, i.e., the Word of the eternal life that the believers heard from the beginning (1:1-2). Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (v. 22), is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us. In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ's person (v. 26). This indicates that the Son and the Father are the eternal life for our regeneration and enjoyment. In this eternal life we have fellowship with God and with one another (1:2-3, 6-7) and have our being in our daily walk (v. 6; 1:7). ",
  "8277":"In the relative sense (see note 1 par. 2, in ch. 1). ",
  "8278":"See note 27. ",
  "8279":"The singular pronoun He, referring to both the Son and the Father in the preceding verse, indicates that the Son and the Father are one. As far as our experience of the divine life is concerned, the Son, the Father, Jesus, and Christ are all one. It is not that only the Son, and not the Father, is the eternal life to us. It is that Jesus, being the Christ as the Son and the Father, is the eternal, divine life to us for our portion. ",
  "8280":"In the Gospel of John, such as in John 3:15; 4:14; 6:40, 47; 10:10; 11:25; 17:2-3. ",
  "8281":"According to the context of vv. 22-25, the eternal life is just Jesus, Christ, the Son, and the Father; all these are a composition of the eternal life. Hence, the eternal life also is an element of the all-inclusive, compound indwelling Spirit, who moves within us. ",
  "8282":"This indicates that this section of the Word was written to inoculate the believers with the truth of the Divine Trinity against the heresies concerning Christ's person. ",
  "8283":"Or, deceive you. To lead the believers astray is to distract them from the truth concerning Christ's deity and humanity by means of heretical teachings concerning the mysteries of what Christ is. ",
  "8284":"See note 20. ",
  "8285":"See note 25. ",
  "8286":"This is the indwelling of the all-inclusive, compound life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 11). ",
  "8287":"Concerning the indwelling of the Divine Trinity (John 14:17, 23), we do not need anyone to teach us; by the anointing of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, who is the composition of the Divine Trinity, we know and enjoy the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and life supply. ",
  "8288":"It is not an outward teaching by words but an inward teaching by anointing, through our inner spiritual consciousness. This teaching by anointing adds the divine elements of the Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our inner being. It is like the repeated painting of some article: the paint not only indicates the color, but also by coat upon coat being added, the elements of the paint are added to the thing painted. It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements. ",
  "8289":"According to the context, all things refers to all things concerning the person of Christ, which are related to the Divine Trinity. The teaching of the anointing concerning these things keeps us that we may abide in Him (the Divine Trinity), that is, in the Son and in the Father (v. 24). ",
  "8290":"The anointing within us of the compound Spirit as the composition of the Triune God, who is true (5:20), is a reality, not a falsehood. It can be proven by our actual and practical experience in our Christian life. ",
  "8291":"The Greek word means to stay (in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy); hence, to abide, remain, and dwell. To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father (v. 24). This is to remain and dwell in the Lord (John 15:4-5). It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7), i.e., abide in the divine light (v. 10). We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing, that our fellowship with God (1:3, 6) may be maintained. ",
  "8292":"See note 1. The word that begins in v. 13, written to the three different classes of recipients, ends in v. 27. Verse 28 turns back to all the recipients. Hence, the address is again to the little children, as in vv. 1 and 12. ",
  "8293":"The word addressed to the three groups of recipients in vv. 13-27 concludes in the charge to abide in Him as the anointing has taught. In this section, 2:28--3:24, the apostle continued to describe the life that abides in the Lord. The section begins (v. 28), continues (3:6), and ends (3:24) with abide(s) in Him. ",
  "8294":"Here the pronoun He refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. This, with the preceding clause abide in Him, which is a repetition of the clause in the preceding verse involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit. ",
  "8295":"This indicates that some believers, those who do not abide in the Lord (i.e., remain in the fellowship of the divine life according to pure faith in Christ's person) but are led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ (v. 26), will be punished by being put to shame from Him, from His glorious parousia. ",
  "8296":"See Matt. 7:23, note 51 in Matt. 24, and Matt. 22:13 and note 2. ",
  "8297":"Lit., in His presence (parousia). ",
  "8298":"The Greek word denotes perception with a conscious knowledge, a deeper inward seeing. This is for knowing the Lord. ",
  "8299":"Here He denotes the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; all-inclusively, because it refers to He and Him in the preceding verse, which denote the coming Son; it also refers to Him in this verse, denoting the Father, who has begotten us. This indicates strongly that the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30). ",
  "8300":"This refers to the righteous God in 1:9 and Jesus Christ the Righteous in v. 1 of this chapter. In this word to all the recipients, beginning from v. 28, the apostle turned his emphasis from the fellowship of the divine life (1:3--2:11) and the anointing of the Divine Trinity (vv. 12-27) to the righteousness of God. The fellowship of the divine life and the anointing of the Divine Trinity should have an issue, that is, the expression of the righteous God. ",
  "8301":"Or, know that ... (imperative). ",
  "8302":"The Greek word denotes outward, objective knowledge (see notes 55 in John 8, 17 in John 21, and 11 in Heb. 8). This is for knowing man. ",
  "8303":"See note 6 in ch. 1. This is not to do righteousness occasionally and purposely as some particular act but to practice righteousness habitually and unintentionally as a common daily living. It is the same in 3:7. This is a spontaneous living that issues from the divine life within us, with which we have been begotten of the righteous God. Hence, it is a living expression of God, who is righteous in all His deeds and acts. It is not just an outward behavior but the manifestation of the inward life; not just an act of purpose but the flow of life from within the divine nature, of which we partake. This is the first condition of the life that abides in the Lord. It is all due to the divine birth, which is indicated by the word has been begotten of Him and the title children of God in the succeeding verse (3:1). ",
  "8304":"John's writings on the mysteries of the eternal divine life stress very much the divine birth (3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18; John 1:12-13), which is our regeneration (John 3:3, 5). It is the greatest wonder in the entire universe that human beings could be begotten of God and sinners could be made children of God! Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life (1:2), as the divine seed sown into our being (3:9). Out of this seed all the riches of the divine life grow from within us. It is by this that we abide in the Triune God and live out the divine life in our human living, i.e., live out the life that does not practice sin (3:9) but practices righteousness (2:29), loves the brothers (5:1), overcomes the world (5:4), and is not touched by the evil one (5:18). ",
  "8305":"The passage from 2:28--3:3 is a single paragraph on the righteous living of God's children. ",
  "8306":"See note 5 in ch. 2. ",
  "8307":"Of the Triune God implied in the preceding verse (see 2:29 and note 2), here the Father is mentioned particularly. He is the source of the divine life, the One of whom we have been born with this life. The love of God was manifested by His sending of His Son to die for us (4:9; John 3:16) in order that we might have His life and thus become His children (John 1:12-13). God's sending of His Son was that He might beget us. Hence, the love of God is a begetting love, particularly in the Father. ",
  "8308":"This word corresponds with begotten of Him in the preceding verse. We have been begotten of the Father, the source of life, to be the children of God &#151; God being the Owner of the children. We partake of the Father's life to express the Triune God. ",
  "8309":"Or, on this account, for this reason. Because we are the children of God by a mysterious birth with the divine life, the world does not know us. ",
  "8310":"See note 29 in ch. 2. ",
  "8311":"The world is ignorant of our being regenerated by God; it does not know us, because it did not know God Himself. It was ignorant of God, so it is also ignorant of our divine birth. ",
  "8312":"Since we are the children of God, we will be like Him in the maturity of life when He is manifested. To be like Him is \"what we will be.\" This has not yet been manifested. This indicates that the children of God have a great future with a more splendid blessing: we will not only have the divine nature but will also bear the divine likeness. To partake of the divine nature is already a great blessing and enjoyment, yet to be like God, bearing His likeness, will be a greater blessing and enjoyment. ",
  "8313":"See note 29 in ch. 2. ",
  "8314":"He refers to God in the previous sentence and denotes Christ, who is to be manifested. This not only indicates that Christ is God but also implies the Divine Trinity. When Christ is manifested, the Triune God will be manifested; when we see Him, we will see the Triune God; and when we are like Him, we will be like the Triune God. ",
  "8315":"By seeing Him we will reflect His likeness (2 Cor. 3:18), which will cause us to be as He is. ",
  "8316":"The hope of being like the Lord, of bearing the likeness of the Triune God. ",
  "8317":"According to the context of this section, 2:28--3:24, to purify ourselves is to practice righteousness (v. 7; 2:29), to live a righteous life that is the expression of the righteous God (1:9), the righteous One (2:1). This is to be pure without any stain of unrighteousness, even as He is perfectly pure. This also describes the life that abides in the Lord. ",
  "8318":"Lit., that One; referring to Jesus Christ. So in vv. 5 (first time) and 7. ",
  "8319":"See note 6 in ch. 1. To practice sin is not merely to commit sin in occasional acts but to live in sin (Rom. 6:2), to live a life that is not under the principle of God's ruling over man. ",
  "8320":"I.e., having no law, being without law. This does not denote being without the Mosaic law (cf. Rom. 5:13), because sin was already in the world before the Mosaic law was given. To be without law here denotes being without, or not under, the principle of God's ruling over man. To practice lawlessness is to live a life outside of and not under the principle of God's ruling over man. Hence, lawlessness is sin, or, reciprocally, sin is lawlessness. ",
  "8321":"The same Greek word as in John 1:29. There Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, which came into the world through Adam (Rom. 5:12). Here He takes away sins, which are committed by all men. John 1 deals with the totality of sin, including the sinful nature and sinful deeds. This chapter deals only with the fruits of sin, that is, the sins committed in man's daily life. Both are taken away by Christ. ",
  "8322":"In that One who takes away both sin (the sinful nature) and sins (sinful deeds), sin is not. Hence, He did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21), He committed no sin (1 Pet. 2:22), and He was without sin (Heb. 4:15). This qualified Him to take away both the indwelling sin and the sins committed in man's daily life. ",
  "8323":"I.e., remains in the fellowship of the divine life and walks in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7). See note 27 in ch. 2. ",
  "8324":"I.e., does not sin habitually. This too is a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. It does not mean that the children of God do not commit sin at all; they may commit sin occasionally. It means that the regenerated believers who have the divine life and live by it do not practice sin. Their character and habit are not to sin but to abide in the Lord. Abiding in the Lord is a believer's living; sinning is a sinner's life. ",
  "8325":"I.e., practices sin, lives a sinful life. ",
  "8326":"I.e., has not received any vision of the Lord and has no realization of Him. Such a condition is like that of an unbeliever. ",
  "8327":"See note 1 in ch. 2. ",
  "8328":"Or, deceive you. ",
  "8329":"See note 6 in ch. 1. To practice righteousness is to live a righteous life (see note 29 in ch. 2), to live rightly under the principle of God's ruling. This is, according to the next verse, not to practice sin and, according to v. 4, not to practice lawlessness. All these are the purifying of ourselves (v. 3). ",
  "8330":"According to the context, righteous here equals pure in v. 3. To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is. ",
  "8331":"See note 6 in ch. 1. This verse indicates that to practice sin (see note 4) and to sin in this book are synonymous, denoting living in sin, committing sin habitually. Such a life is of the devil, whose life is one of sin and who has sinned continually from the beginning. Sin is his nature, and sinning is his character. ",
  "8332":"See note 10 in Rev. 2. ",
  "8333":"In the absolute sense, that is, from the time the devil began to rebel against God and attempted to overthrow God's rule. See note 1 par. 2, in ch. 1. ",
  "8334":"Lit., unto this; i.e., to this end. The devil has sinned continually from ancient times and begets sinners that they might practice sin with him. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on the cross in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the devil (Heb. 2:14); and take away both sin and sins (note 5). ",
  "8335":"Or, dissolve, undo. ",
  "8336":"See note 29 in ch. 2. ",
  "8337":"Not to practice sin does not mean that we do not commit sin in occasional acts, but that we do not live in sin. See note 4. ",
  "8338":"Denoting God's life, which we received of God when we were begotten of Him. This life, as the divine seed, abides in every regenerated believer. Hence, such a one does not practice sin and cannot sin. ",
  "8339":"I.e., cannot live in sin habitually. A regenerated believer may fall into sin occasionally, but the divine life as the divine seed in his regenerated nature will not allow him to live in sin. This is similar to a sheep: it may fall into the mud, but its clean life will not allow it to remain and wallow in the mud as a swine would. ",
  "8340":"To practice or not practice sin, that is, to live in or not live in sin, is not a matter of behavior but of whose children we are, the children of God or the children of the devil. Hence, it is a matter of life and nature. Men, as fallen descendants of Adam, are born children of the devil, the evil one (John 8:44), and possess his life, partake of his nature, and live in sin automatically and habitually. Practicing sin is their life. But the believers, who are redeemed from their fallen state and are reborn in their spirit, are the children of God, who possess His life, partake of His nature, and do not live in sin. Practicing righteousness is their life. Whether one is a child of God or a child of the devil is manifested by what he practices, righteousness or sin. A reborn believer may commit sin, and an unsaved man may do righteousness. Both are their outward behavior, not their outward living, and thus do not manifest what they are in their inward life and nature. ",
  "8341":"Righteousness is the nature of God's acts; love is the nature of God's essence. What God is, is love; what God does is righteousness. Love is inward; righteousness is outward. Hence, love is a stronger manifestation that we are the children of God than righteousness. Therefore, from this verse through v. 24 the apostle proceeds from righteousness to love in the manifestation of the children of God, as a further condition of the life that abides in the Lord. ",
  "8342":"See note 7 in ch. 2. ",
  "8343":"In the relative sense (see note 1 par. 2, in ch. 1). ",
  "8344":"This is a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord. ",
  "8345":"Cain's being of the evil one equals his being a child of the devil; Cain's brother Abel was of God, i.e., was a child of God (v. 10). ",
  "8346":"See note 19 in ch. 5. ",
  "8347":"That is, the people of the world, who, like Cain, are the children of the devil (v. 10) and the components of Satan's cosmic system (the world &#151; John 12:31). If the people of the world, who lie in the evil one, the devil (5:19), hate the believers (the children of God), we need not marvel; it is natural for them to do so. ",
  "8348":"Death is of the devil, God's enemy, Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death; life is of God, the source of life, signified by the tree of life, which issues in life (Gen. 2:9, 16-17). Death and life are not only of two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres. To pass out of death into life is to pass out of the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of death into the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of life. This took place in us at our regeneration. We know this, i.e., have the inner consciousness of it, because we love the brothers. Love (the love of God) toward the brothers is strong evidence of this. Faith in the Lord is the way for us to pass out of death into life; love toward the brothers is the evidence that we have passed out of death into life. To have faith is to receive the eternal life; to love is to live by the eternal life and express it. ",
  "8349":"Not loving the brothers is evidence that one is not living by the essence and element of the divine love and is not remaining in the sphere of that love; rather, this one is living in the essence and element of the satanic death and abiding in its sphere. ",
  "8350":"In relation to the divine attributes, hatred is versus love, death is versus life, darkness is versus light, and lies (falsehoods) are versus truth. All the opposites of these divine virtues are of the evil one, the devil. ",
  "8351":"Murderer here does not denote an actual murderer but indicates that in spiritual ethics hating equals murdering. No actual murderer (an unsaved person), as Cain was (v. 12), has eternal life abiding in him. Since we know this, we, who have passed out of death into life and have eternal life abiding in us, should not behave like an unsaved murderer by hating our brothers in the Lord. This section concerns the life that abides in the Lord. A believer who has eternal life but does not abide in the Lord and let the Lord, who is the eternal life, abide and work in him might hate a brother and commit other sins occasionally. But this would not be habitual. ",
  "8352":"Lit., soul. ",
  "8353":"Lit., souls. ",
  "8354":"Lit., bowels. ",
  "8355":"See note 5 in ch. 2. ",
  "8356":"See note 1 in ch. 2. ",
  "8357":"Deed is versus word, and truthfulness is versus tongue. Tongue denotes the play of vain talk, and truthfulness, the reality of love. ",
  "8358":"See note 6 point 7, in ch. 1. ",
  "8359":"Denoting the reality of the eternal life, which we received of God in our divine birth, enabling us to love the brothers by the divine love (vv. 14-18). By loving the brothers with the divine love, we know that we are of this reality. See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8360":"Or, conciliate, convince, assure, tranquilize. To persuade our heart before God is to have a good conscience, void of offense (1 Tim. 1:5, 19; Acts 24:16), that our heart may be conciliated, convinced, assured, and tranquilized. This too is a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. To abide in the Lord requires a tranquil heart with a conscience void of offense. This is also vital to our fellowship with God, which was covered in the first section of this Epistle. A heart disturbed by an offended conscience frustrates our abiding in the Lord and breaks our fellowship with God. ",
  "8361":"Actually, it is our conscience, which is a part not only of our spirit but also of our heart, that blames (condemns) us. The conscience in our heart is the representative of God's ruling within us. If our conscience condemns us, surely God, who is greater than His representative and knows all things, will condemn us. The consciousness of such condemnation in our conscience alerts us to the danger of breaking our fellowship with God. If we attend to this, it will be a help to our fellowship with God and will keep us abiding in the Lord. ",
  "8362":"The Greek word means boldness of speech, confidence. We have such boldness in tranquility to contact God, to fellowship with Him, and to ask of Him, because there is no condemnation of the conscience in our heart. This preserves us in the abiding in the Lord. ",
  "8363":"Offenses in the conscience of a condemning heart are obstacles to our prayer. A conscience void of offense in a tranquil heart straightens and clears the way for our petition to God. ",
  "8364":"This is not the keeping of the commandments of the Mosaic law by one's own endeavor and strength; rather, it is a part of the believers' living as the issue of the divine life that abides in them, by the habitual keeping of the Lord's New Testament commandments through the inner operation of the power of the divine life. The keeping of the Lord's commandments accompanies the practicing, the habitual doing, of the things that are pleasing in His sight, and it becomes the prerequisite for God's answering our prayers and constitutes a condition of the life that abides in the Lord (v. 24). ",
  "8365":"Lit., practice. See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8366":"This is a summary of the commandments in the preceding and succeeding verses. All the commandments are summarized in two: to believe in the name of God's Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another. The first concerns faith; the second, love. To have faith is to receive the divine life in our relationship with the Lord; to love is to live the divine life in our relationship with the brothers. Faith touches the source of the divine life; love expresses the essence of the divine life. Both are needed for the believers to live a life that abides in the Lord. ",
  "8367":"This verse is the conclusion of this section, which begins in 2:28, on our abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing, as unfolded in the preceding section (2:20-27). This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed (vv. 15, 9, and note 29 in ch. 2), which grows in the practicing of the righteousness of their begetting God (2:29; 3:7, 10) and the love of their begetting Father (vv. 10-11, 14-23). Such an abiding and its bases &#151; the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed &#151; are mysterious yet real in the Spirit. ",
  "8368":"We abide in the Lord; then He abides in us. Our abiding in Him is a condition for His abiding in us (John 15:4). We enjoy His abiding in us by our abiding in Him. ",
  "8369":"Lit., out of. The phrase by the Spirit ...modifies we know. ",
  "8370":"Thus far in this Epistle the Spirit has not been referred to, though the Spirit is anonymously implied in the anointing in 2:20 and 27. Actually, the Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit (see note 19 in Phil. 1), is the vital and crucial factor of all the mysteries unveiled in this Epistle: the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the abiding in the Lord, the divine birth, and the divine seed. It is by this Spirit that we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (Gal. 3:14); He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally (John 3:31-35). This Spirit and the eternal life (v. 15) are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continuously. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses assuringly with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16) and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us (4:13). It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). And it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14). ",
  "8371":"Verses 1-6 are parenthetical and are a warning to the believers to discern the spirits (since the Spirit, whereby we know that the Lord abides in us, is mentioned in the preceding verse, 3:24) that they may know the false prophets. A similar warning was given in 2:18-23. The expressions every spirit and the spirits refer to the spirits of the prophets (1 Cor. 14:32), which are motivated by the Spirit of truth, and the spirits of the false prophets, which are actuated by the spirit of deception. Hence, there is the need to discern the spirits by proving them to determine whether they are of God. ",
  "8372":"I.e., discern the spirits (1 Cor. 12:10) by putting them on trial. ",
  "8373":"Lit., out of; so also in succeeding verses. ",
  "8374":"In Matt. 24:24 the false prophets differ from the false Christs. But here the false prophets are the antichrists (v. 3), those who teach heretically concerning the person of Christ (2:18 and note 2; 2:22-23). ",
  "8375":"The spirit of a genuine prophet, which is motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth; such a spirit confesses the divine conception of Jesus, affirming that He was born as the Son of God. Every such spirit is surely of God. In this we know the Spirit of God. ",
  "8376":"Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). To confess that Jesus has come in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (Luke 1:31-35). Since He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception. ",
  "8377":"The spirit of a false prophet, which is actuated by the spirit of deception; such a spirit does not confess that Jesus came in the flesh. This is the spirit of the errors of the Docetists (or, Docetes). This name was derived from the Greek word meaning to seem, to appear to be. The heretical view of the Docetists was that Jesus Christ was not a real man but simply appeared to be; to them He was merely a phantasm. Docetism was intermixed with Gnosticism, which taught that all matter was essentially evil. Hence, the Docetists taught that since Christ is holy, He could never have had the defilement of human flesh. They taught that His body was not real flesh and blood but was merely a deceptive, transient phantom, and thus that He did not suffer, die, and resurrect. Such a heresy undermines not only the Lord's incarnation but also His redemption and resurrection. Docetism was a characteristic feature of the first antichristian errorists, whom John had in view here and in 2 John 7. The spirit of such errorists is surely not of God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. ",
  "8378":"See note 18 in ch. 2. ",
  "8379":"The believers are of God because they have been begotten of God (v. 7; 2:29; 3:9). ",
  "8380":"See note 1 in ch. 2. ",
  "8381":"The false prophets (v. 1), the antichrists (v. 3), who taught heretically concerning Christ's person. The believers have overcome them by abiding in the truth concerning Christ's deity and concerning His humanity through divine conception, according to the teaching of the divine anointing (2:27). ",
  "8382":"The Triune God, who dwells in the believers as the all-inclusive, life-giving, anointing Spirit and who strengthens them from within with all the rich elements of the Triune God (Eph. 3:16-19). Such a One is much greater and stronger than Satan, the evil spirit. ",
  "8383":"Satan, the fallen angel, who as the evil spirit usurps fallen mankind and who operates in evil persons, the components of his world system. This one is lesser and weaker than the Triune God. ",
  "8384":"Both the heretics and the heresies concerning Christ's person are of the satanic world system. Hence, the people who are the components of this evil system listen to them and follow them. ",
  "8385":"The apostles, the believers, and the truth that they believe and teach concerning Christ are of God. Hence, the God-knowing people, who have been begotten of God (v. 7), listen to them and stay with them. ",
  "8386":"The worldlings are not of God, because they have not been begotten of God. Hence, they do not listen to the believers. ",
  "8387":"Lit., out of this. This refers to what was mentioned in vv. 5 and 6. From the fact that the heretics and what they speak out of their spirit, actuated by the spirit of deception, are of the world, and we and what we speak out of our spirit, motivated by the Spirit of truth, are of God, we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception. This implies that the Holy Spirit of truth is one with our truth-speaking spirit and that the evil spirit of deception is one with the heretics' deception-speaking spirit. ",
  "8388":"The Spirit of truth is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13); the spirit of deception is Satan, the evil spirit, the spirit of falsehood (Eph. 2:2). ",
  "8389":"Denoting the divine reality revealed in the New Testament (see note 6 in ch. 1), especially, as seen here, concerning the divine incarnation of the Lord Jesus, to which the Spirit of God testifies (v. 2). This reality is in contrast to the deception of the evil spirit, the spirit of the antichrist, which denies the divine incarnation of Jesus (v. 3). ",
  "8390":"Verses 7-21 are an extension of the section from 2:28--3:24 and further stress brotherly love, already covered in 3:10-24, as a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord. ",
  "8391":"See note 5 in ch. 2. ",
  "8392":"The believers, who have been begotten of God and know God, love one another habitually with the love that is out of God and is the expression of God. ",
  "8393":"The apostle's emphasis here is still the divine birth, through which the divine life has been imparted into the believers, the life that affords them the life ability to know God. This divine birth is the basic factor of brotherly love, which is a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord. See note 29 in ch. 2. ",
  "8394":"A knowing by the divine life (John 17:3) received from the divine birth. ",
  "8395":"He who has not known God does not have the knowing ability of the divine life received from the divine birth. Such a one, who has not been begotten of God and does not have God as his life, does not love with God as love, since he does not know God as love. ",
  "8396":"See note 5 in ch. 2. This Epistle says first that God is light (1:5) and then that God is love. Love, as the nature of God's essence, is the source of grace, and light, as the nature of God's expression, is the source of truth. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth (see note 6 final par., in ch. 1). Both of these were manifested in this way in John's Gospel. We received both grace and truth there through the manifestation of the Son (John 1:14, 16-17). Now in John's Epistle we come in the Son to the Father and touch the sources of both grace and truth. These sources, love and light, are God the Father Himself for our deeper and finer enjoyment in the fellowship of the divine life with the Father in the Son (1:3-7) through our abiding in Him (2:5, 27-28; 3:6, 24). See note 5 in ch. 1. ",
  "8397":"Lit., in us; i.e., in our case, or, in regard to us. In God's sending of His Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him, the higher and nobler love of God was manifested among us. ",
  "8398":"As in 1 Tim. 1:15, the place where fallen mankind is. ",
  "8399":"We, the fallen people, are not only sinful in nature and conduct (Rom. 7:17-18; 1:28-32) but also dead in our spirit (Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13). God sent His Son into the world not only to be a propitiation for our sins that we might be forgiven (v. 10) but also to be life to us that we might have life and live through Him. In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood (Eph. 1:7; Rev. 1:5) but also from our death by His life (3:14-15; John 5:24). He is not only the Lamb of God who takes away our sin (John 1:29); He is also the Son of God who gives us eternal life (John 3:36). He died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that we might have eternal life in Him (John 3:14-16) and live through Him (John 6:57; 14:19). In this the love of God, which is God's essence, has been manifested. ",
  "8400":"Referring to the following fact: it is not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God. ",
  "8401":"See note 2 in ch. 2. ",
  "8402":"To love with the love of God, as He loved us. ",
  "8403":"This indicates that if we love one another with the love of God, as He loved us, we express Him in His essence, so that others can behold in us what He is essentially. ",
  "8404":"To love one another is a condition of our abiding in God (v. 13), and our abiding in God is a condition of His abiding in us (John 15:4). Hence, when we love one another, God abides in us and His love is manifested perfectly in us. ",
  "8405":"The love of God in 2:5 denotes God's love within us that becomes our love toward Him, and it is with this love that we love Him. His love here denotes God's love within us that becomes our love toward one another, and it is with this love that we love one another. This indicates that we should take God's love as our love with which we love Him and love one another. ",
  "8406":"The Greek word means to complete, to accomplish, to finish. In God Himself the love of God itself is perfect and complete. However, in us it needs to be perfected and completed in its manifestation. It was manifested to us in God's sending of His Son to be both a propitiatory sacrifice and life to us (vv. 9-10). Yet if we do not love one another with this love as it was manifested to us, that is, if we do not express it by loving one another with the love with which God loved us, it is not manifested perfectly and completely. This love is perfected and completed in its manifestation when we express it in our living by habitually loving one another with it. Our living in which we love one another in the love of God is the perfection and completion of this love in its manifestation in us. Thus, in our living in God's love, others can behold God manifested in His essence, which is love. ",
  "8407":"In that God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us (James 4:5; Rom. 8:9, 11), is the witness in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually. This is evidenced by our living, a living in which we love one another habitually with His love (v. 12). ",
  "8408":"To abide in God is to dwell in Him, to remain in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us. This is to practice our oneness with God according to the divine anointing (2:27) by living a life that practices His righteousness and His love. It is all carried out by the operation of the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who dwells in our spirit and who is the basic element of the divine anointing. ",
  "8409":"Lit., out of. God has given us out of His Spirit. This closely resembles, and almost repeats, the word in 3:24, which proves that this does not mean that God has given us something of His Spirit, such as the various gifts in 1 Cor. 12:4, but that He has given the Spirit Himself as the all-inclusive gift (Acts 2:38). Out of His Spirit is an expression that implies that the Spirit of God, whom God has given to us, is bountiful and without measure (Phil. 1:19; John 3:34). By such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other. ",
  "8410":"The Father's sending of the Son to be our Savior is an external act, so that through our confessing of the Son He can abide in us and we in Him (v. 15). The apostles have beheld and testify this. This is the outward testimony. In addition to this, God's internal act toward us is the sending of His Spirit to dwell in us as inward evidence that we abide in Him and He in us (v. 13). ",
  "8411":"Fallen mankind, as in John 3:16. ",
  "8412":"God the Father sent His Son as the Savior of the world (v. 14) that men may believe in Him by confessing that Jesus is the Son of God, so that God may abide in them and they in God. But the heretical Cerinthians did not confess this; hence, they did not have God abiding in them, nor did they abide in God. Whoever confesses this, God abides in him and he in God. He becomes one with God in the divine life and nature. ",
  "8413":"In sending the Son to be our Savior (v. 14). ",
  "8414":"See note 9. ",
  "8415":"See note 8. That God is love was manifested in His sending of His Son to be our Savior and life (vv. 9-10, 14). ",
  "8416":"To abide in love is to live a life in which we love others habitually with the love that is God Himself, that He may be expressed in us. ",
  "8417":"To abide in God is to live a life that is God Himself as our inward content and outward expression, that we may be absolutely one with Him. ",
  "8418":"God abides in us to be our life inwardly and our living outwardly. Thus He can be one with us practically. ",
  "8419":"I.e., our abiding in the love that is God Himself (v. 16). In this the love of God is perfected in us, that is, perfectly manifested in us, that we may have boldness without fear (v. 18) in the day of judgment. ",
  "8420":"See note 12. ",
  "8421":"See note 21 in ch. 3. There the boldness is for us to contact God in fellowship with Him. Here the boldness is for us to face the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ. ",
  "8422":"The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) at His coming back (1 Cor. 3:13; 4:5; 2 Tim. 4:8). ",
  "8423":"As in 3:3, 7, this refers to Christ, who lived in this world a life of God as love and who is now our life that we may live the same life of love in this world and be the same as He is. ",
  "8424":"Fear does not refer to the fear that we will offend God and be judged by Him (1 Pet. 1:17; Heb. 12:28) but to the fear that we have offended God and will be judged by Him. Love refers to the perfected love mentioned in the preceding verse, the love of God with which we love others. ",
  "8425":"Perfect love is the love that has been perfected (v. 17) in us by our loving others with the love of God. Such love casts out fear and has no fear of being punished by the Lord at His coming back (Luke 12:46-47). ",
  "8426":"I.e., not lived in the love of God that it might be perfectly manifested in him. See note 12. ",
  "8427":"God first loved us in that He infused us with His love and generated within us the love with which we love Him and the brothers (vv. 20-21). ",
  "8428":"He who hates a brother habitually proves that he is not abiding in the divine love or in the divine light (2:9-11). When we abide in the Lord, we abide in both the divine love and the divine light; we do not hate the brothers but love them habitually, living the divine life in the divine light and the divine love. ",
  "8429":"The Gnostics and the Cerinthians did not believe that Jesus and the Christ were identical (see notes 22 in ch. 2 and 3 in ch. 4). Hence, they were not the children of God, were not begotten of God. But whoever believes that the man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate (John 1:1, 14; 20:31), has been begotten of God and has become a child of God (John 1:12-13). Such a one loves God the Father, who has begotten him, and also loves the brother, who has been begotten of the same Father. This explains, confirms, and strengthens the word in the preceding verses (4:20-21). ",
  "8430":"Loving God and practicing His commandments are the prerequisites for our loving the children of God. This is based on the divine birth and the divine life. ",
  "8431":"Lit., practice. See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8432":"See notes 5 and 15 in ch. 2. ",
  "8433":"Keeping the commandments of God constitutes our love toward Him and is an evidence that we love Him. ",
  "8434":"Lit., heavy. To the divine life with its capability, the commandments of God are not heavy. ",
  "8435":"Referring to every person who has been begotten of God. Yet such an expression should refer especially to that part, i.e., the spirit of the regenerated person, that has been regenerated with the divine life (John 3:6). The regenerated spirit of the regenerated believer does not practice sin (3:9) and overcomes the world. The believer's divine birth with the divine life is the basic factor for such victorious living. ",
  "8436":"Both in his Gospel and in this Epistle John stressed the divine birth (John 1:13; 3:3, 5; 1 John 2:29 and note 7; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18), through which the divine life is imparted into the believers in Christ (John 3:15-16, 36; 1 John 5:11-12). This divine birth, which brings in the divine life, is the basic factor of all the mysteries concerning the divine life, such as the fellowship of the divine life (1:3-7), the anointing of the Divine Trinity (2:20-27), the abiding in the Lord (2:28--3:24), and the divine living that practices the divine truth (1:6), the divine will (2:17), the divine righteousness (2:29; 3:7), and the divine love (3:11, 22-23; 5:1-3) to express the divine Person (4:12). The divine birth with the divine life is also the basic factor in this section, vv. 4-21. It assures the God-begotten believers, giving them confidence in the ability and virtue of the divine life. ",
  "8437":"Since regenerated believers have the capability of the divine life to overcome the world, the powerful satanic world system, the commandments of God are not heavy or burdensome to them (v. 3). ",
  "8438":"See note 15 in ch. 2. ",
  "8439":"The faith that brings us into the organic union with the Triune God and that believes that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 5) that we may be begotten of God and have His divine life, by which we are enabled to overcome the Satan-organized-and-usurped world. ",
  "8440":"Such a believer is one who has been begotten of God and has received the divine life (John 1:12-13; 3:16). The divine life empowers him to overcome the evil world energized by Satan. The Gnostics and the Cerinthians, who were not believers of this kind, remained pitiful victims of the evil satanic system. ",
  "8441":"He, Jesus Christ, came as the Son of God that we might be born of God and have the divine life (John 10:10; 20:31). It is in His Son that God gives us eternal life (vv. 11-13). Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; John 1:31), by the blood He shed on the cross (John 19:31-35; Matt. 27:50-54), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (John 1:32-34; 3:34). By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us (vv. 7-10), that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name (vv. 11-13; John 3:16, 36; 20:31). The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life (Rom. 8:2), germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation, by regenerating them with the divine life. Thus they are born of God and become His children (John 3:5, 15; 1:12-13) and live a life that practices the truth (1:6), the will of God (2:17), the righteousness of God (2:29), and the love of God (3:10-11) for His expression. ",
  "8442":"Some MSS add, and Spirit. ",
  "8443":"Or, by. ",
  "8444":"The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality (John 14:16-17; 15:26), testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life. By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (Col. 3:4). ",
  "8445":"Denoting the reality of all that Christ as the Son of God is (John 16:12-15). See note 6 in ch. 1. ",
  "8446":"I.e., unto the one point or purpose in their testimony. ",
  "8447":"The testimony by the water, the blood, and the Spirit that Jesus is the Son of God is the testimony of God, which is greater than that of men. ",
  "8448":"God testified concerning His Son so that we might believe into His Son and have His divine life. If we believe into His Son, we receive and have His testimony in ourselves; otherwise, we do not believe what He has testified, and we make Him a liar. ",
  "8449":"The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son. His Son is the means through which He gives us His eternal life, which is His goal for us. ",
  "8450":"Because the life is in the Son (John 1:4) and the Son is the life (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), the Son and the life are one, inseparable. Hence, he who has the Son has the life, and he who does not have the Son does not have the life. ",
  "8451":"The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe into the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life. Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the Holy Writings are the assurance concerning this fact &#151; they are the title deed to our eternal salvation. By them we are assured and have the pledge that as long as we believe into the name of the Son of God, we have eternal life. ",
  "8452":"Verses 4-13 show us how we have received eternal life, which is mentioned in 1:1-2. Then vv. 14-17 tell us how we should pray in the fellowship of eternal life, which is mentioned in 1:3-7. ",
  "8453":"Referring to the boldness that we have for our prayer in fellowship with God. See note 21 in ch. 3. ",
  "8454":"Based on the fact that we have received eternal life through the divine birth by believing into the Son of God, we can pray, in the fellowship of eternal life, by contacting God in the boldness of a conscience void of offense (Acts 24:16), according to His will, assured that He will hear us. ",
  "8455":"This knowing is based on the fact that after receiving the divine life we abide in the Lord and are one with Him in our praying to God in His name (John 15:7, 16; 16:23-24). ",
  "8456":"Not in ourselves according to our mind but in the Lord according to God's will. ",
  "8457":"Lit., toward. ",
  "8458":"This must be a prayer made while we are abiding in fellowship with God. ",
  "8459":"The subject is still he, the subject of the first predicate shall ask, indicating that the asker will give life to the one for whom he is asking. This does not mean that the asker has life of himself and can give life by himself to others. It means that such an asker, who is abiding in the Lord, who is one with the Lord, and who is asking in one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), becomes the means by which God's life-giving Spirit can give life to the ones for whom he is asking. This is a matter of life-imparting in the fellowship of the divine life. To be one who can give life to others, we must abide in the divine life and walk, live, and have our being in the divine life. In James 5:14-16 the prayer is for healing; here the prayer is for life-imparting. ",
  "8460":"Undoubtedly, this refers to spiritual life imparted, through the prayer of the asker, into the one for whom he is asking. However, according to the context, this spiritual life will also rescue the physical body of the one for whom the asker is asking, from the danger of suffering death because of his sinning (cf. James 5:15). ",
  "8461":"Concerning sin unto death, Bible teachers have different interpretations. Some say that it refers to the sin of the antichrists in denying that Jesus is the Christ (2:22), which keeps them in death forever. But according to the context of this verse, sin unto death is related to a sinning brother, not to an antichrist or any other unbeliever. Since this section, vv. 14-17, is related to prayer in the fellowship of eternal life (covered in 1:3--2:11), whatever it deals with must be related to the matter of the fellowship of the divine life. In the fellowship of the divine life there is the governmental dealing of God according to the spiritual condition of each of His children. In God's governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age because of a certain sin, and others may be destined to physical death because of other sins. The situation is like that of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, who were dealt with by physical death because they lied to the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:1-11), and like that of the Corinthian believers, who were dealt with by the same judgment because they did not discern the Body (1 Cor. 11:29-30). This was typified by God's dealing with the children of Israel in the wilderness (1 Cor. 10:5-11). All the Israelites except Caleb and Joshua were judged by God with physical death because of certain sins. God's governmental dealing is severe. Miriam, Aaron, and even Moses were not spared from this kind of dealing, which came because of certain of their failures (Num. 12:1-15; 20:1, 12, 22-29; Deut. 1:37; 3:26-27; 32:48-52). The punishment of God's governmental dealing with His children is not at all related to eternal perdition; it is a dispensational dealing according to the divine government, a dealing that is related to our fellowship with God and with one another. Whether or not a sin is unto death depends on God's judgment according to the sinning believer's position and condition in the house of God. In any case, for the children of God to sin is a serious matter. It may be judged by God with physical death in this age! The apostle did not say that we should make request concerning a sin that is unto death. ",
  "8462":"Every wrongdoing, everything that is not just or righteous, is sin (cf. 3:4 and note 2). ",
  "8463":"That we might avoid sinning, which not only interrupts the fellowship of the divine life (1:6-10) but may even bring in physical death (vv. 16-17), here the apostle again stressed, by the assurance of the capability of the divine life, our divine birth, which is the basis of the victorious life. The basic fact of our divine birth prevents us, the regenerated ones, from practicing sin (3:9 and note 2), that is, from living in sin (Rom. 6:2). See note 29 in ch. 2. ",
  "8464":"Some teachers say, based on John 17:15, that he here refers to Christ, who was begotten of God and keeps the regenerated one. But the phrase begotten of God in this clause, a repetition of the phrase in the preceding clause, is the factor that, according to logic, determines that he refers still to the regenerated believer. A regenerated believer (especially his regenerated spirit, which is born of the Spirit of God &#151; John 3:6) keeps himself from living in sin, and the evil one does not touch him (especially his regenerated spirit). His divine birth with the divine life in his spirit is the basic factor of such a safeguard (see note 4). ",
  "8465":"I.e., guards himself by watchful care. ",
  "8466":"See note 19. ",
  "8467":"I.e., grasp, lay hold of, for doing harm and fulfilling evil purposes. ",
  "8468":"Lit., out of. Since we have been begotten of God, we are out of Him and thus possess His life and partake of His nature. By this we are separated unto God from the satanic world, which lies in the evil one. ",
  "8469":"\"The whole world\" comprises the satanic world system (2:15 and note 2) and the people of the world, the fallen human race. ",
  "8470":"I.e., remains passively in the sphere of the evil one's influence, under the evil one's usurpation and manipulation. While the believers are living and moving actively by the life of God, the whole world (and especially the people of the world) is lying passively under the usurping and manipulating hand of Satan, the evil one. ",
  "8471":"The Greek word does not refer to an essentially worthless and wicked character, nor does it indicate worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue. It refers to one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, one who affects others, influencing them to be evil and vicious. Such an evil one is Satan, the devil, in whom the whole world lies. ",
  "8472":"I.e., come through incarnation to bring God to us as grace and reality (John 1:14) that we may have the divine life, as revealed in John's Gospel, to partake of God as love and light, as unveiled in this Epistle. ",
  "8473":"The faculty of our mind enlightened and empowered by the Spirit of reality (John 16:12-15) to apprehend the divine reality in our regenerated spirit. ",
  "8474":"This is the ability of the divine life to know the true God (John 17:3) in our regenerated spirit (Eph. 1:17) through our renewed mind, enlightened by the Spirit of reality. ",
  "8475":"The genuine and real God. ",
  "8476":"The Greek word (an adjective akin to the word reality in John 1:14; 14:6, 17) means genuine, real, as opposed to false and counterfeit. ",
  "8477":"We not only know the true God; we are also in Him. We not only have the knowledge of Him; we are in an organic union with Him. We are one with Him organically. ",
  "8478":"To be in the true God is to be in His Son Jesus Christ. Since Jesus Christ as the Son of God is the very embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), to be in Him is to be in the true God. This indicates that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the true God. ",
  "8479":"This refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him as the genuine God and be one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ. All this is the genuine and real God and eternal life to us. All that this genuine and real God is to us is eternal life to us, that we may partake of Him as everything to our regenerated being. ",
  "8480":"See note 1 in ch. 2. ",
  "8481":"I.e., garrison yourselves against attacks from without, such as the assaults of the heresies. ",
  "8482":"Referring to the heretical substitutes for the true God that were brought in by the Gnostics and the Cerinthians, as revealed in this Epistle and in John's Gospel and as referred to in the preceding verse. The idols here also refer to anything that replaces the real God. As genuine children of the genuine God, we should be on the alert to guard ourselves from these heretical substitutes and from all vain replacements for our genuine and real God, with whom we are organically one and who is eternal life to us. This is the aged apostle's word of warning to all his little children as a conclusion to his Epistle. <br><br>   The center of this Epistle's revelation is the divine fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship between the children of God and their Father God, who is not only the source of the divine life but is also light and love as the source of the enjoyment of the divine life (1:1-7; 4:8, 16). To enjoy the divine life we need to abide in its fellowship according to the divine anointing (2:12-28; 3:24), based on the divine birth with the divine seed for the development of the divine birth (2:29--3:10). This divine birth was carried out by three means: the terminating water, the redeeming blood, and the germinating Spirit (vv. 1-13). By these we have been born of God to be His children, possessing His divine life and partaking of His divine nature (2:29--3:1). He is now indwelling us through His Spirit (3:24; 4:4, 13) to be our life and life supply that we may grow with His divine element unto His likeness at His manifestation (3:1-2). To abide in the divine fellowship of the divine life, that is, to abide in the Lord (2:6; 3:6), is to enjoy all His divine riches. By such abiding we walk in the divine light (1:5-7) and practice the truth, righteousness, love, the will of God, and the commandments of God (1:6; 2:29, 5; 3:10-11; 2:17; 5:2) by the divine life received through the divine birth (2:29; 4:7). To preserve ourselves in this abiding in the divine fellowship, three main negative things need to be dealt with. The first is sin, which is lawlessness and unrighteousness (1:7--2:6; 3:4-10; 5:16-18); the second is the world, which is composed of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this life (2:15-17; 4:3-5; 5:4-5, 19); and the last is idols, which are the heretical substitutes for the genuine God and the vain replacements for the real God (v. 21). These three categories of exceedingly evil things are weapons used by the evil one, the devil, to frustrate, harm, and, if possible, even annihilate our abiding in the divine fellowship. The safeguard against his evildoings is our divine birth with the divine life (v. 18); and, based on the fact that through His death on the cross the Son of God destroyed the works of the devil (3:8), we overcome him by the word of God that abides in us (2:14). By virtue of our divine birth we also overcome his evil world by our faith in the Son of God (vv. 4-5). Moreover, our divine birth with the divine seed that was sown into our inner being enables us not to live habitually in sin (3:9; 5:18), because Christ has taken away sins through His death in the flesh (3:5). In case we sin occasionally, we have our Advocate as our propitiatory sacrifice to take care of our case before our Father God (2:1-2), and His everlasting efficacious blood cleanses us (1:7). Such a revelation is the basic and substantial element of the apostle's mending ministry. ",
  "8483":"The apostle John, like Peter, was an elder in the church at Jerusalem before its destruction in A.D. 70 (Gal. 2:9, and note 1 in 1 Pet. 5). According to history, after returning from his exile, John stayed in Ephesus to care for the churches in Asia. Thus, he was probably also an elder in the church at Ephesus, where he wrote this Epistle. ",
  "8484":"Gk. kuria, the feminine form of kurios, which means lord, master. There are different interpretations of the word here. The most preferred is as follows: it refers to a Christian sister of some prominence in the church, as does co-chosen in 1 Pet. 5:13. Kuria might have been her name, since it was a common name at that time. Some mention that according to history she lived near Ephesus and that her sister (v. 13) lived in Ephesus, where the church was under John's care. There was a church in her locality, and it met in her home. ",
  "8485":"The same as the Greek word for truth. According to John's usage of this word, especially in his Gospel, here it denotes the revealed divine reality &#151; the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son, Jesus Christ &#151; becoming man's genuineness and sincerity, that man may live a life that corresponds with the divine light (John 3:19-21) and worship God, as God seeks, according to what He is (John 4:23-24). This is the virtue of God (Rom. 3:7; 15:8) becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers (see note 6 point 7, in 1 John 1). In such genuineness the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved the one to whom he wrote. ",
  "8486":"Those who not only have received Christ by believing that He is both God and man but also fully know the truth concerning the person of Christ. ",
  "8487":"Denoting the divine reality of the gospel (see note 6 in 1 John 1), especially concerning the person of Christ as revealed in John's Gospel and first Epistle, that is, that Christ is both God and man, having both deity and humanity, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature, to express God in human life and to accomplish redemption with divine power in human flesh for fallen human beings that He may impart the divine life into them and bring them into an organic union with God. The second and third Epistles of John stress this truth. The second warns the faithful believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth &#151; in the teaching concerning Christ. The third encourages the believers to receive and help those who work for this truth. ",
  "8488":"With his mending ministry concerning the revelation of the person of Christ, the apostle John, in his Gospel and first Epistle, inoculated the believers against the heresies regarding Christ's divinity and humanity. Because of such an inoculating truth, he and all those who knew this truth loved those who were faithful to this truth (v. 1). ",
  "8489":"The divine reality, defined in note 1. This divine reality, which is actually the Triune God, abides in us now and will be with us for eternity. ",
  "8490":"Some MSS read, you. ",
  "8491":"Truth here denotes the divine reality of the gospel, as defined in note 1 especially concerning the person of Christ, who expressed God and accomplished God's purpose; love is the believers' expression in loving one another through receiving and knowing the truth. These two matters are the basic structure of this Epistle. In them grace, mercy, and peace will be with us. The apostle greeted and blessed the believers with grace, mercy, and peace, based on the fact that these two crucial things existed among the believers. When we walk in the truth (v. 4) and love one another (v. 5), we will enjoy the divine grace, mercy, and peace. ",
  "8492":"The truth concerning the person of Christ is the basic and central element of John's mending ministry. When he found the children of the faithful believer walking in truth, he rejoiced greatly (3 John 3-4). ",
  "8493":"The divine reality, especially concerning the person of Christ, as defined in note 1. The Father commands us to walk in this reality, that is, in the realization of the divine fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (cf. Matt. 17:5), that we may honor the Son as the Father desires (John 5:23). ",
  "8494":"See note 34 in John 13. So in the succeeding verses. ",
  "8495":"The commandment given by the Son that we love one another (John 13:34). The Father commands us to walk in the truth that we may honor the Son, and the Son commands us to love one another that we may express Him. ",
  "8496":"See note 1 par. 2, in 1 John 1. ",
  "8497":"Lit., it. ",
  "8498":"Heretics, such as the Cerinthians, the false prophets (1 John 4:1). ",

  "8502":"I.e., watch yourselves, watch for yourselves. ",
  "8503":"Or, destroy, ruin. ",
  "8504":"The things that the apostles wrought were the things of the truth concerning Christ, which the apostles ministered and imparted to the believers. To be influenced by the heresies regarding the person of Christ was to lose, destroy, and ruin the precious things concerning the person of Christ that the apostles had wrought into the believers. The apostle warned the believers to watch for themselves lest they be influenced by the heresies and lose the things of the truth. ",
  "8505":"According to the context, especially v. 9, the full reward must be the Father and the Son as the full enjoyment to the faithful believers, who abide in the truth concerning the person of Christ and do not deviate from it under the influence of the heresies regarding Christ. This interpretation is justified by the fact that there is no indication that this reward will be given in the future, as will the rewards mentioned in Matt. 5:12; 16:27; 1 Cor. 3:8, 13-14; Heb. 10:35-36; and Rev. 11:18; 22:12. If we would not be led astray by the heresies but would abide faithfully in the truth concerning the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ, who is both God and man, both our Creator and our Redeemer, we will enjoy in Him the Triune God to the fullest extent as our full reward, even today on earth. ",
  "8506":"Lit., leads forward (in a negative sense); i.e., goes further than what is right, advances beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. This is in contrast to abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, practiced this. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently, they could not have God in salvation and in life. ",
  "8507":"Not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception. ",
  "8508":"To have God is to have both the Father and the Son. It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father (1 John 2:23) to be our enjoyment and reality (John 1:1, 14). In the incarnated God we have the Son in His redemption and the Father in His life. We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life. Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment; but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life. ",
  "8509":"Not only teach it as a theory but bring it as a reality. ",
  "8510":"A heretic, an antichrist (v. 7; 1 John 2:22), a false prophet (1 John 4:1), one who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ, as today's modernists do. Such a one we must reject, not receiving him into our house nor greeting him. Thus we will not have any contact with him or any share in his heresy, heresy that is blasphemous to God and contagious like leprosy. ",
  "8511":"The Greek word means be happy, rejoice, hail; it is used for greeting or bidding farewell. ",
  "8512":"Just as bringing to others the divine truth of the wonderful Christ is an excellent deed (Rom. 10:15), so spreading the satanic heresy, which defiles the glorious deity of Christ, is an evil work. It is a blasphemy and abomination to God. It is also a damage and curse to men. No one who is a believer in Christ and a child of God should have any share in this evil! Even to greet such an evil one is prohibited! A severe and clear separation from this evil should be maintained! ",
  "8513":"The apostle expressed his desire for a deeper and richer fellowship with the church member for fullness of joy in the enjoyment of the divine life (1 John 1:2-4). ",
  "8514":"Lit., mouth to mouth. ",
  "8515":"Some MSS read, your. ",
  "8516":"This indicates what an intimate fellowship with the church members and what an endearing care for them the aged elder had. <br><br>   In carrying out his mending ministry with the divine life of the Triune God, the aged apostle John's endearing care for the believers was that the believers would walk in God's truth. God's truth is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man, Christ, who had both divinity and humanity, who through crucifixion accomplished eternal redemption and through resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, to be received by those who repent and believe in Him, as their life and as their everything. The aged apostle's desire was that the believers would love one another in this truth by the divine love of the Triune God to express Him. This truth, this reality, became the genuineness in the apostle's walk, the divine virtue expressed in his redeemed humanity. He loved the believers whom he cared for, in the genuineness of the divine virtue. His love toward the believers was his living, in which the reality, the truth, of the Triune God was joined to the love of the Triune God. Based on this love, he also earnestly hoped that the believers whom he cared for would be the same as he, that they would love one another and have nothing to do with the heretics, those who went beyond the truth concerning the Trinity. The aged apostle's desire was that the believers whom he cared for would remain continually in the divine truth to enjoy the Father and the Son by the Spirit unto eternity. ",
  "8517":"That she did not join in the greeting may indicate that she had died. ",
  "8518":"See note 1 in 2 John. ",
  "8519":"Not the Gaius of Macedonia in Acts 19:29, nor the Gaius of Derbe in Acts 20:4, nor the Gaius of Corinth in 1 Cor. 1:14 and Rom. 16:23, but another named Gaius (the name was very common at that time). According to the contents of this Epistle, he must have been an outstanding brother in the church. ",
  "8520":"See note 1 in 2 John. ",
  "8521":"According to the context of the verse, this refers to external and material things. ",
  "8522":"Probably in the sense of prayer. ",
  "8523":"The Greek word means to go on well, as in a journey (Rom. 1:10). I.e., to succeed in reaching a desired end; thus, to prosper. ",
  "8524":"Bodily health, as in Luke 5:31; 7:10; 15:27. ",
  "8525":"Man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23 and note 5). The soul is the organ that mediates between the body and the spirit; it possesses self-consciousness, that man may have his personality. It is contained in the body and is the vessel to contain the spirit. As to the believer, God as the Spirit dwells in his regenerated spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16) and spreads from his spirit to saturate his soul that it may be transformed to express Him (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). This is the prosperity of the believer's soul. When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit so that it directs and uses our body for God's purposes, it prospers. The apostle wished that the recipient, who was a beloved brother, outstanding in such a prosperity of his soul, might prosper in all things and in bodily health, just as his soul prospered in the divine life. ",
  "8526":"See note 4 in 2 John. ",
  "8527":"Lit., your truth. This is the truth concerning Christ, especially His deity (see note 1 in 2 John). By the revelation of this truth the recipient's way of life was determined, and the recipient held to this truth as his fundamental belief. It is the objective truth that had become subjective in the recipient's daily walk. ",
  "8528":"The recipient not only held to the truth but also walked and lived in the truth. The truth concerning the person of Christ should be not only our belief but also our living, a living that testifies to our belief. ",
  "8529":"See note 4 in 2 John. So also in v. 4.",
  "8530":"Referring to the providing of hospitality (as taught by Paul in Rom. 12:13 and Heb. 13:2), the receiving of the brothers (vv. 7-8) who traveled for the gospel and the ministry of the word. ",
  "8531":"Most of the recipients of the hospitality were strangers, unacquainted with Gaius. ",
  "8532":"In the past. ",
  "8533":"The church where the apostle was. ",
  "8534":"In the future. On one hand, the apostle praised Gaius for what he had done in receiving the traveling brothers in the past; on the other hand, he encouraged him to send them forward in the future. ",
  "8535":"The sending forward should be in a manner that matches God, who is generous, indicating that the sending forward must be with generosity. ",
  "8536":"The exalted and glorious name of the wonderful Christ (Phil. 2:9 and note 3; Acts 5:41; James 2:7). ",
  "8537":"The pagans, who have nothing to do with God's move on this earth to carry out His economy. If anyone who works for God's New Testament economy receives help for God's work, especially financial support, from the unbelievers, this is a shame and even an insult to God. In the apostle's time, the brothers who worked for God took nothing from the pagans. ",
  "8538":"The Greek word is made up of two words: under and to take; thus, to take up (from underneath), that is, to undertake, to sustain, to support. We, the believers, including the apostle, ought to support and undertake for the needs of the brothers who work for God in His divine truth and who take nothing from the Gentiles. ",
  "8539":"Denoting the revealed divine reality as the contents of the New Testament, according to the apostles' teaching concerning the Divine Trinity, especially the person of the Lord Jesus, for God's economy. All the apostles and faithful brothers worked for this. ",
  "8540":"Of which Gaius was a member. ",
  "8541":"The Greek word is made up of of Zeus (Zeus was the chief of the gods in the Greek pantheon) and to nourish; hence, Zeus-nourished. This indicates that Diotrephes, a professing Christian, never dropped his pagan name, contrary to the practice of the early believers, who took a Christian name at their baptism. According to history, he advocated the Gnostic heresy, which blasphemed the person of Christ. It is no wonder that he mingled with the believers as one who loved to be first among them. ",
  "8542":"This is against the words of the Lord in Matt. 20:25-27 and 23:8-11, which keep all His believers on the same level, that of brothers. In 2 John 9 the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ. Here in 3 John 9 is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine and loved to be first in the church. The former was a matter of intellectual arrogance; the latter, of self-exaltation in one's actions. These two evils are sharp weapons used by God's enemy, Satan, to execute his evil plot against God's economy. One damages the believers' faith in the divine reality; the other frustrates the believers' work in God's move. ",
  "8543":"I.e., receive hospitably. ",
  "8544":"The Greek word is derived from a word meaning to boil over, to overflow with words, to talk idly; hence, to babble, to speak folly or nonsense. ",
  "8545":"The Greek word means pernicious, as in 1 John 5:19 (see note 4 there). ",
  "8546":"The Greek word means worthless, wicked, depraved. ",
  "8547":"The Greek word means to be a well-doer (as a favor or a duty), practicing good; hence, to do good. ",
  "8548":"Lit., out of (see note 19 in 1 John 5). God is the source of good. A well-doer, a doer of good, is one who is out of God and who belongs to God (cf. 1 John 3:8). ",
  "8549":"The Greek word means to be an evildoer, practicing evil; hence, to do evil. ",
  "8550":"An evildoer not only is not out of God but has not even seen God. ",
  "8551":"Demetrius, who might have been one of the brothers who traveled in working for the Lord (vv. 5-8), perhaps was the one who bore this Epistle to Gaius. Hence, it was necessary that he receive a favorable and strong commendation from the writer. ",
  "8552":"This indicates that Demetrius must have been a brother working among the churches, and thus was well known. ",
  "8553":"The revealed truth of God as the reality of the essence of the Christian faith (see note 6 in 1 John 1). This truth is the divine rule for the walk of all believers, and by it the believers' walk is determined. Thus, it gives good testimony to him who walks in it, as it did to Demetrius. ",
  "8554":"The apostle John and his associates. ",
  "8555":"The Greek word (an adjective akin to truth (reality) &#151; cf. note 20 in 1 John 5) means genuine, real; hence, true. ",

This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should earnestly contend (1 Tim. 6:12). ",

Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:16), and (2) their denying of the headship and lordship of the Lord. These two go together. Turning the grace of God into an abuse of freedom for the purpose of wantonness requires denying the Lord's rule and authority. ",

This proves that the angels in the preceding verse were the sons of God in Gen. 6:2, who, putting on human bodies, took humans as wives and committed fornication with different flesh, i.e., with human beings, who are different from angels. The males of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities indulged their lust with males (Rom. 1:27; Lev. 18:22), with flesh that was different from what God had ordained, according to the nature of His creation, for human marriage (Gen. 2:18-24).

In view of this, probably, the devil attempted to do something to Moses' body, and the archangel argued with him concerning this.

  "8597":"The Greek word means a rock. It \"may allude here to a sunken rock with the sea over it\" (Darby); hence, hidden reefs. The Greek word for spots in 2 Pet. 2:13 is very similar to the word here for hidden reefs; hence, some translations render this word spots. Actually, these two words refer to two different things. The spots are defects on the surface of precious stones; the hidden reefs are at the bottom of the water. The early heretics were not only spots on the surface but also hidden reefs at the bottom, both of which were a damage to the believers in Christ. ",
  "8598":"Feasts of love motivated by God's love (the higher love &#151; 1 John 4:10-11, 21). In early days the believers often ate together in love for fellowship and worship (Acts 2:46). This kind of feasting was joined to the Lord's supper (1 Cor. 11:20-21, 33) and was called a love feast. ",
  "8599":"The pleasure-seeking heretics (2 Pet. 2:13) pretended to be shepherds, but at the love feasts they fed only themselves, having no concern for others. Toward others, they were waterless clouds, having no life supply to render. ",
  "8600":"Cf. 2 Pet. 2:17 and note 1. ",
  "8601":"Autumn is a season for reaping fruit. The self-seeking apostates seemed to be fruit trees in season, but they had no fruit to satisfy others. They had died twice, not only outwardly, in appearance, as most trees do in autumn, but also inwardly, in nature. They were thoroughly dead; hence, it was right that they were uprooted. ",
  "8602":"Shepherds, clouds, trees, and stars are positive figures in biblical metaphor, but hidden reefs, waves, and the sea are negative. These apostates were false shepherds, empty clouds, dead trees, and wandering stars; they were also hidden reefs and wild, raging waves of the sea, foaming out, without restraint, their own shames. ",
  "8603":"The metaphor of wandering stars indicates that the erratic teachers, the apostates, were not solidly fixed in the unchanging truths of the heavenly revelation but were wandering about among God's starlike people (Dan. 12:3; Rev. 1:20). Their destiny is the gloom of darkness, which has been kept for them for eternity. The erratic apostates are wandering stars today, but they will be imprisoned in the gloom of darkness. ",
  "8604":"This must be the manifestation of the Lord's parousia (coming) as mentioned in 2 Thes. 2:8 and note 3, Matt. 24:27, 30, and Zech. 14:4-5. ",
  "8605":"Lit., in, or, among. ",

It is in each man bound to the spirit, man's higher part, and to the body, man's lower part; drawn upwards by the one, downwards by the other. He who gives himself up to the lower appetites, is fleshly: he who by communion of his spirit with God's Spirit is employed in the higher aims of his being, is spiritual. He who rests midway, thinking only of self and self's interests, whether animal or intellectual, is the psychikos, the selfish man, the man in whom the spirit is sunk and degraded into subordination to the subordinate psyche [soul]\" (Alford). ",
  "8611":"The human spirit, not the Spirit of God. The apostates are devoid of spirit. They \"have not indeed ceased to have a spirit, as a part of their own tripartite nature [1 Thes. 5:23]: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the psyche [soul], the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own\" (Alford). They do not care for their spirit or use it. They do not contact God by their spirit in communion with the Spirit of God; neither do they live and walk in their spirit. They have been drawn downward by their flesh and have become fleshy, so that they have lost the consciousness of their conscience (see note 12 in 2 Pet. 2) and have become like animals without reason (v. 10).

The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit enjoyed through our prayer are necessary for our building up. Both the faith and the Spirit are holy. ",
  "8614":"We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves upon our holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit (v. 20); thus we await and look for the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity (Matt. 19:29). ",

  "8623":"In this concluding praise the writer indicated clearly that although he had charged the believers to endeavor in the things mentioned in vv. 20-23, only God our Savior was able to guard them from stumbling and set them before His glory without blemish in exultation. To Him be glory...! ",

  "8630":"As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the entire divine revelation, the whole Bible. The seeds of most of the truths of the divine revelation were sown in Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The growth of all these seeds is progressively developed in the succeeding books, especially in the books of the New Testament, and the harvest is reaped in the book of Revelation. Hence, most of the things covered in this book are not absolutely new but are in the preceding books and are perfected in this book, the focus of which is the unique, ultimate revelation of Christ, the particular, consummate testimony of Jesus, and the universal, eternal economy of God. <br><br>   This book is a book of prophecy &#151; not prophecy merely in words but in visions revealed to the seer. In the eyes of God, all the things prophesied in this book have already taken place. Thus, all were shown to the seer, vision after vision. Therefore, most of the verbs used in this book are in the past tense. <br><br>   The whole Bible reveals Christ; the book of Revelation especially, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the whole Bible, is \"the revelation of Jesus Christ.\" Although this book also reveals many other things, the focus of its revelation is Christ. Several aspects concerning Christ, such as the vision of Christ as the High Priest in the midst of the churches, caring for them in love yet with a judging attitude (vv. 13-16), the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God's throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God's universal administration (5:1--6:1), and the vision of Him as \"another strong Angel\" coming down out of heaven to take possession of the earth (10:1-8; 18:1), etc., were never unveiled as they are in this book. ",
  "8631":"The revelation of this book is composed mainly of signs, i.e., symbols with spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands, signifying the churches; the seven stars, signifying the messengers of the churches (v. 20), etc. Even the New Jerusalem is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God's economy (chs. 21--22). This book, then, is a book of signs through which the revelation is made known to us. <br><br>   John's Gospel is a book of signs signifying how Christ came to be our life to produce the church, His bride. John's Revelation is a book of signs showing how Christ is now caring for the church and how He is coming to judge and possess the earth and bring the church, His bride, into God's full economy. ",
  "8632":"On one hand, this book gives us the revelation of Christ, and on the other hand, it shows us the testimony of Jesus, which is the church. It presents to us the revealed Christ and the testifying church. The lampstands in ch. 1, the great multitude of the redeemed in ch. 7, the bright woman with her man-child in ch. 12, the harvest with its firstfruits in ch. 14, the overcomers on the sea of glass in ch. 15, the bride ready for marriage in ch. 19, and the New Jerusalem in chs. 21 and 22 are all the testimony of Jesus. This testimony of Jesus is the spirit &#151; the substance, the disposition, and the characteristic &#151; of the prophecy (19:10). <br><br>   Christ is the Witness of God (1:5), the testimony and the expression of God. The church is the testimony and the expression of Christ. As such, the church is the reproduction of the testimony and the expression of God in Christ. ",
  "8633":"The revelation in this book is in the nature of prophecy. Most of the visions refer to things to come. Even the seven epistles to the seven churches in chs. 2 and 3, in the sense of their being signs, are prophecies concerning the church on earth in the period until the Lord's coming back. ",
  "8634":"Seven is the number for completion in God's operation &#151; e.g., the seven days for God's creation (Gen. 1:31--2:3) and the seven seals (5:5), seven trumpets (8:2), and seven bowls (15:7) for God's move on the earth. Hence, the seven churches are for God's move in completion. ",
  "8635":"Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province were the seven cities mentioned in v. 11. The seven churches were in those seven cities, respectively; they were not all in one city. This book does not deal with the one universal church but with the local churches in many cities. First, in Matt. 16:18 the church is revealed as universal, and then in Matt. 18:17 it is revealed as local. In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Ephesus (Acts 20:17), and the churches in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:41). The Epistles were written to the local churches, except for a few written to individuals. Not one was written to the universal church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality or actuality. The universal church is realized in the local churches. Knowing the church in its universal aspect must be consummated in knowing the church in its local aspect. It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches. Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage. To know this book, we must advance from the understanding of the universal church to the realization and practice of the local churches, because this book is written to the local churches. Only those who are in the local churches are positioned rightly, with the right angle and the proper perspective, to see the visions in this book. <br><br>   The Triune God is expressed in Christ (John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Col. 2:9); Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit (John 14:16-18; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19) and is expressed in His Body, the universal church (Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:4); and the universal church is expressed in the local churches. Therefore, to know and experience God, we need to know and experience Christ; to know and experience Christ, we need to participate in the universal church through the Spirit; and to participate in the universal church, we need to participate in the local churches. ",
  "8636":"He who is and who was and who is coming is God the eternal Father. The seven Spirits who are before God's throne are the operating Spirit of God, God the Spirit. Jesus Christ, to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth (v. 5), is God the Son. This is the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's operation (see note 5). As God the Son, He is (1) the Witness, the testimony, the expression of God; (2) the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation; and (3) the Ruler of the kings of the earth for the world. From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted to the churches. ",
  "8637":"Him ...who is coming may imply Christ's coming again, indicating that to His creatures, especially His redeemed, what the Triune God is will be more real at that time than in the past or in the present.",
  "8638":"The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God in vv. 4 and 5. As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on the earth. In essence and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold. This is similar to the lampstand in Zech. 4:2. In its existence it is one lampstand, but in its function it is seven lamps. At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded; the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God's move and work on the earth. <br><br>   In Matt. 28:19 the sequence of the Triune God is: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit's speaking in 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; 22:17. <br><br>   At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers. Here, however, the Spirit is included; from Him grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church for God's move. ",
  "8639":"To be released from sins is more significant than to be washed from sins. ",
  "8640":"Lit., in. ",
  "8641":"The believers, redeemed by the blood of Christ, not only have been born of God into His kingdom (John 3:5) but also have been made a kingdom for God's economy. This kingdom is the church (Matt. 16:18-19). John, the writer of the book, was in this kingdom (v. 9), and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom (Rom. 14:17). <br><br>   One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth in order to make the whole earth His kingdom (11:15). When Christ came, He brought the kingdom of God with Him (Luke 17:21; Matt. 12:28). This kingdom has been enlarged into the church (Matt. 16:18-19), which will accomplish the establishing of the kingdom of God on the whole earth. On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers (12:10). Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom (2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6). ",
  "8642":"The redemption accomplished through Christ's blood made us not only a kingdom to God but also priests to God (1 Pet. 2:5). The kingdom is for God's dominion, whereas priests are for the expression of God's image. This is the kingly, royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9), which is for the fulfillment of God's original purpose in creating man (Gen. 1:26-28). This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today's church life (5:10). It will be practiced intensively in the millennial kingdom (20:6) and will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem (22:3, 5). ",
  "8643":"In this book, Christ's coming back is revealed in two aspects. In one aspect Christ will come secretly as a thief (3:3; 16:15), and in another aspect He will come openly on the cloud (v. 7; 14:14). This corresponds with Matt. 24:43, 30. The day and hour of His coming in the first aspect are unknown (Matt. 24:36), whereas the day of His coming in the second aspect is clearly revealed &#151; it will be at the last trumpet (the seventh trumpet), at the end of the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52; 2 Thes. 2:1-3). ",
  "8644":"Christ went to heaven on a cloud. He will come back to earth in the same way (Acts 1:9, 11; Matt. 26:64; Rev. 14:14). ",
  "8645":"Referring to the tribes of the land of Israel, those who had pierced Christ. See reference 7c. ",
  "8646":"Or, earth. The same Greek word as in 6:8, 10, and 8:13. ",
  "8647":"Lit., beat (the breasts). ",
  "8648":"The eternal and Almighty God is the Alpha, the beginning for the origination, and the Omega, the ending for the completion of God's eternal purpose. He was the Alpha in the book of Genesis. Now, in this book, He is the Omega. Whatever He originated He will complete. Governmentally, He continues His universal operation, which He originated from ancient times and will bring to completion (21:6). ",
  "8649":"For the tribulation and kingdom, endurance is needed. ",
  "8650":"Jesus denotes the suffering and sorrowing Savior (Isa. 53:3). ",
  "8651":"The island of Patmos was the place where John had been exiled for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus when he received the revelation of this book. ",
  "8652":"This book stresses not only the Spirit of God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's intensified move, but also our human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God's move. Only spirit (our spirit) can respond to Spirit (God's Spirit). This book is composed of four major visions: (1) the vision of the churches (chs. 1--3), (2) the vision of the destiny of the world (chs. 4--16), (3) the vision of Babylon the Great (chs. 17--20), and (4) the vision of the New Jerusalem (chs. 21--22). John was in his spirit when he saw these four visions (v. 10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10); that is, he received the revelation of the mystery of Christ in his spirit, according to what is mentioned in Eph. 3:5. We too need to be in our spirit to see the visions in this book. It is a matter not merely of mental understanding in our mind but of spiritual realization in our spirit. ",
  "8653":"Here the Lord's Day should be the first day of the week, the day the Lord was resurrected (John 20:1). The early church met regularly on this day (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2). It was on this day that John was in spirit and saw the visions of God's economy. ",
  "8654":"This book's being sent to the seven churches equals its being sent to the seven cities. This shows clearly that the practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church. In no city was there more than one church. This is the local church, with the city, not the street or the area, as the unit. The jurisdiction of a local church should cover the whole city in which the church is located; it should not be greater or lesser than the boundary of the city. All the believers within that boundary should constitute the one unique local church within that city. ",
  "8655":"To see anything requires the right position with the right angle. First, the apostle John heard the voice (v. 10), and then, when he turned to see the voice, he saw the golden lampstands. He was rightly positioned, but he still needed the right angle to see the vision concerning the churches; so he turned. It is the same with us today. Many Christians need to be adjusted in their position and to be turned that they may see the vision of the churches. ",
  "8656":"In figure, gold signifies the divine nature. Here the lampstands are golden, signifying that the churches are constituted with the divine nature. ",
  "8657":"In the Bible the lampstand is always related to God's building. The first time the lampstand was mentioned was in Exo. 25:31-40, when the tabernacle was built. The second instance was in regard to the building of the temple in 1 Kings 7:49. The third instance was closely related to the rebuilding of God's temple in Zech. 4:2-10. Here in Revelation the lampstand is related to the building of the churches. In Exo. 25 the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as seven lamps with the Spirit (the oil). In Zech. 4 the emphasis is on the Spirit (Zech. 4:6) as seven lamps shining, these seven lamps being the seven eyes of God (Zech. 4:2, 10). The seven eyes of God are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 5:6) for God's intensified move. This indicates that the lampstand in Zechariah is the reality of the lampstand in Exodus, and that the lampstands in Revelation are the reproduction of the lampstand in Zechariah. Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed as the churches. The shining Spirit is the reality of the shining Christ, and the shining churches are the reproduction and expression of the shining Spirit to accomplish God's eternal purpose that the New Jerusalem as the shining city may be consummated. Christ, the Spirit, and the churches are all of the same divine nature. ",
  "8658":"Christ today is in the midst of the churches. On one hand, as the High Priest, He is interceding in the heavens for the churches (Heb. 9:24; 7:25-26; Rom. 8:34), and on the other hand, He is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. To participate in His move and enjoy His care, we must be in the churches. ",
  "8659":"Christ not only is depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, but also is unveiled as being like the Son of Man. He is both divine and human. As our High Priest, He is caring for the churches in His humanity. <br><br>   Christ as the Son of Man is not only for the accomplishing of redemption but also for the church life, because the church is composed of human beings. That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection. His dealings here with the churches are based on His humanity. In His humanity He was altogether victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God. The churches also, being in humanity, surely can be victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God. ",
  "8660":"The garment reaching to the feet is the priestly robe (Exo. 28:33-35) and signifies the fullness of Christ's divine attributes and human virtues (cf. Isa. 6:1, 3). ",
  "8661":"The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry (Exo. 28:4). In Dan. 10:5 Christ also is girded at His loins, with fine gold. But here Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts. The breasts signify love. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for the work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love. Christ's work in producing the churches has been accomplished. He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for the work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. This requires that He be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle. The golden girdle signifies the divine strength. Christ is moving in the churches to care for them in His humanity and with His divine strength. ",
  "8662":"White hair signifies great age (Job 15:10). Here it indicates the ancientness of the Lord. In S. S. 5:11 He is depicted as having black hair, which signifies His unfading and everlasting strength. ",
  "8663":"White wool issues from the nature of life, and white snow comes from the sky, from heaven. Hence, white wool here and in Dan. 7:9 signifies that the ancientness of Christ is out of His nature, not out of His becoming old, while white snow signifies that His ancientness is heavenly, not earthly. ",
  "8664":"In S. S. 5:12 the eyes of Christ are like doves. That is for the expression of His love. Here His eyes are like a flame of fire. This is for Him to observe and search that He may exercise judgment by enlightening. In this book His eyes are not two but seven (5:6). Seven is the number of completion in God's move. Hence, Christ's eyes in this book are for God's operation. These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire (cf. Dan. 10:6) burning before the throne, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (4:5). The \"fire burning\" equals the \"flame of fire\" and is for observing and searching. The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth (5:6) also are for God's move on the earth. Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God's move and operation on earth today. ",
  "8665":"This book has a judging nature. Fire is for divine judgment (1 Cor. 3:13; Heb. 6:8; 10:27). \"Our God is also a consuming fire\" (Heb. 12:29); His throne is a fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him (Dan. 7:9-10). All this is for judgment. The Lord's eyes being like a flame of fire is mainly for His judgment (2:18-23; 19:11-12). When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire (10:1). ",
  "8666":"Feet signify the walk. In typology bronze signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). The feet of Christ are like shining bronze, as mentioned also in Dan. 10:6, signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment. Hence, when He comes to possess the earth by judging it, His feet will be like pillars of fire (10:1). ",
  "8667":"To be fired in a furnace is to be tried by being burned. Christ's walk was tried by His sufferings, even by His death on the cross. Hence, His walk is bright, like shining bronze, which qualifies Him to judge the unrighteous. ",
  "8668":"The sound of many waters, a tumultuous sound, is the sound of the voice of the Almighty God (Ezek. 1:24; 43:2). It signifies the seriousness and solemnity of His speaking (cf. 10:3). ",
  "8669":"Both lampstands and stars are for shining in the night. A lampstand, representing a local church, is a collective unit, whereas a star, representing a messenger of a local church, is an individual entity. In the dark night of the church's degradation, the shining of both the collective churches and the individual messengers is needed. ",
  "8670":"In S. S. 5:16, \"His mouth is most sweet,\" and in the Gospels \"words of grace [proceeded] out of His mouth\" (Luke 4:22); but here, \"out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.\" This is Christ's discerning, judging, and slaying word (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17). The words of grace are for His supply of grace to His favored ones, whereas the sharp two-edged sword is for His dealing with negative persons and things. ",
  "8671":"In S. S. 5:10, 13, Christ's face appears lovely for His seeker's appreciation of Him, and in the Epistles His face reflects God's glory (2 Cor. 4:6) for the imparting of life into His believers. Here, however, His face shone as the sun shines in its power (cf. Dan. 10:6); this shining is the judging enlightenment for bringing in the kingdom. When He was transfigured and His face shone like the sun, that was His coming in the kingdom (Matt. 16:28--17:2). When He comes to take over the earth for the kingdom, His face will be like the sun (10:1). ",
  "8672":"Christ's being the First and the Last implies that He will accomplish what He has begun. See note 13 in ch. 22.",
  "8673":"The very Christ who walks in the midst of the churches, who is the Head of the churches and to whom the churches belong, is the living One. Hence, the churches also, as the expression of His Body, should be living, fresh, and strong. ",
  "8674":"Because of the fall and sin of man, death came in and is now working on earth to gather all the sinful people into Hades. Thus, death is a collector and Hades is a keeper. However, the keys of death and of Hades are in the hand of our Savior, who died and was resurrected. ",
  "8675":"When John saw the seven stars upon the right hand of Christ and the seven golden lampstands in the midst of which was Christ, it was a mystery to him. He did not realize the significance of the seven heavenly stars and the seven golden lampstands. Hence, the Lord unveiled the mystery to him, saying that \"the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.\" The significance of this not only was a mystery to John but also is a mystery to believers today. All believers need the unveiling of this mystery that they may see the churches and their messengers. <br><br>   The churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands, are the testimony of Jesus (vv. 2, 9) in the divine nature, shining in the dark night locally yet collectively. The churches should be of the divine nature &#151; golden. They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil (Christ as the life-giving Spirit) and shine in the darkness individually and collectively. They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally. They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe. They are of the same nature and in the same shape. They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness. The differences among the seven churches recorded in chs. 2 and 3 are all of a negative nature, not a positive one. Negatively, in their failures, the churches are different and separate from one another; but positively, in their nature, shape, and purpose, they are absolutely identical and are connected to one another. <br><br>   It is easy for believers to see the universal church, but it is difficult for them to see the churches. The revelation of the local churches is the Lord's ultimate unveiling concerning the church, and it is recorded in the last book of the divine Word. To fully know the church, believers must follow the Lord from the Gospels through the Epistles to the book of Revelation until they are enabled to see the local churches as unveiled here. In Revelation the first vision is concerning the churches. The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose. <br><br>   The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches, the ones who bear the responsibility for the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly position like stars. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the managing of the local churches (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Titus 1:5). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time this book was written the offices in the churches had deteriorated because of the degradation of the church. In this book the Lord calls our attention back to the spiritual reality. Hence, this book emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church's degradation. In the first vision of this book, the vision concerning the churches, both Christ and the messengers of the churches are unveiled with the churches as never before, and this in a most particular way. For this the believers need to see a particular vision in their spirits. ",
  "8676":"The same Greek word as for angels. The same word as in v. 1. ",
  "8677":"The seven epistles in chs. 2 and 3 are the record of the actual situation existing in the seven churches at the time these epistles were written. However, since this book is a book of signs with a prophetic nature, the situations of the seven churches also are signs, signifying prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages. The first epistle, to the church in Ephesus, provides a picture of the end of the initial church, the church in the first stage, during the latter part of the first century. The second epistle, to the church in Smyrna, prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire, from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great, the Caesar of the Roman Empire, brought the church into imperial favor. The third epistle, to the church in Pergamos, pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world, from the day Constantine accepted Christianity to the time the papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. The fourth epistle, to the church in Thyatira, depicts prophetically the apostate church, from the ordaining of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of this age, when Christ comes back. The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis, prefigures the Protestant Church, from the Reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ's coming back. The sixth epistle, to the church in Philadelphia, predicts the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church outside all denominational and divisive systems, to the second appearing of the Lord. The seventh epistle, to the church in Laodicea, foreshadows the degraded church life of the brothers in the nineteenth century, from the latter part of the nineteenth century until the Lord's return. ",
  "8678":"In Greek the names of the seven cities are full of significance, each name exactly matching the spiritual condition of the church in that particular city. Ephesus in Greek means desirable. This signifies that the initial church at its end was still desirable to the Lord; the Lord still had much expectation in her. ",
  "8679":"At the beginning of each of these seven epistles the Lord told us what kind of person He is, according to the condition of the church revealed in that particular epistle. ",
  "8680":"The messengers of the churches, the spiritual ones, signified by the shining stars, who bear the testimony of Jesus, are held in the right hand of the Lord, and the Lord is walking in the midst of the churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands. What a wonderful scene! On one hand, the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God, as our High Priest interceding for us, the churches (Heb. 7:25); on the other hand, He is holding the messengers of the churches and is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. ",
  "8681":"The Greek word for first is the same as that translated best in Luke 15:22. Our first love toward the Lord must be the best love for Him. ",
  "8682":"As the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23), the church is a matter of life; as the new man (Eph. 2:15), it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ (John 3:29), it is a matter of love. The first Epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:16-19); and it is for the church life that grace is with all those who love the Lord Jesus (Eph. 6:24). Now this second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord. Nothing but love can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles (vv. 2-3), but she left her first love toward the Lord. The leaving of the first love is the source of all the degradation in the succeeding stages of the church. ",
  "8683":"If we have left our first love toward the Lord and do not repent, we will lose the testimony of the Lord, and the lampstand will be removed from us. ",
  "8684":"The Greek word is composed of two words, one meaning conquer or be victorious over and another meaning common people, secular people, or laity. Thus, it means conquering the common people, being victorious over the laity. Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteem themselves higher than common believers. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy adopted and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. The Lord hates the works, the behavior, of these Nicolaitans, and we must hate what the Lord hates. <br><br>   God in His economy intended that all His people be priests serving Him directly. In Exo. 19:6, God ordained the children of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. This means that God wanted them all to be priests. However, because they worshipped the golden calf (Exo. 32:1-6), they lost the priesthood, and only the tribe of Levi, because of its faithfulness to God, was chosen to replace the whole nation of Israel as priests to God (Exo. 32:25-29; Deut. 33:8-10). Hence, there was a mediatorial class between God and the children of Israel. This became a strong system in Judaism. In the New Testament, God has returned to His original intention according to His economy, in that He has made all believers in Christ priests (1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). But at the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God's economy. According to church history, this became a system that was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and has been retained by the Protestant churches. Today in the Roman Catholic Church there is the priestly system, in the state churches there is the clerical system, and in the independent churches there is the pastoral system. All these are a mediatorial class, spoiling the universal priesthood of all believers. Thus, there are two distinct classes &#151; the clergy and the laity. But in the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be priests of God. Because the mediatorial class destroys the universal priesthood in God's economy, the Lord hates it. <br><br>   Among the seven serving ones in Acts 6:5, one was named Nikolaos (Gk.). There is nothing in church history to indicate that this Nikolaos was the first of the Nicolaitans. ",
  "8685":"Although our angle and position may be right, we still may not have the proper ear to hear. Chapter 1 emphasizes seeing and chs. 2 and 3 emphasize hearing. In spiritual things, seeing depends on hearing. The writer of this book first heard the voice (1:10) and then saw the vision (1:12). If our ears are heavy and cannot hear, then we cannot see (Isa. 6:9-10). The Jews would not hear the word of the Lord, so they could not see what the Lord was doing according to the new testament (Matt. 13:15; Acts 28:27). The Lord always wants to open our ears to hear His voice (Job 33:14-16; Isa. 50:4-5; Exo. 21:6) that we may see things according to His economy. The heavy ears need to be circumcised (Jer. 6:10; Acts 7:51). The sinners' ears need to be cleansed with the redeeming blood and anointed with the Spirit (Lev. 14:14, 17, 28). To serve the Lord as priests, we must have our ears cleansed with the redeeming blood (Exo. 29:20; Lev. 8:23-24). According to this book, as the Spirit is speaking to the churches, we all need an opened, circumcised, cleansed, and anointed ear to hear the Spirit's speaking. ",
  "8686":"At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chs. 2 and 3, it is the Lord who speaks (vv. 1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). But at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit who speaks to the churches (vv. 7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes that in the darkness of the church's degradation the Spirit is vitally important, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in 1:4. The same emphasis is seen also in 14:13 and 22:17. ",
  "8687":"On one hand, each of the seven epistles is the Lord's word to a particular church, but on the other hand, it is the Spirit's word to all the churches. Every church needed to give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches. This implies that all the churches, as the Lord's testimony in the Spirit, should be the same. <br><br>   Since the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we must be in the churches to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit's speaking. Otherwise, how could we hear? ",
  "8688":"In these seven epistles, to overcome is to overcome the degraded situation of the churches. In this epistle, to overcome is to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy that the Lord hates. ",
  "8689":"Religion always teaches, but the Lord feeds (John 6:35). The apostle Paul did the same thing; that is, he fed the believers (1 Cor. 3:2). For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings but the eating of the Lord as our bread of life in our spirit (John 6:57). Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit (Matt. 4:4; Heb. 5:12-14). Here in this epistle the Lord promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. This points back to Gen. 2:8-9, 16, which concerns the matter of eating ordained by God. In the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the Lord promised the overcomer that he would eat of the hidden manna (v. 17), which refers to the eating of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness (Exo. 16:14-16, 31). And in the epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord promised to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is to eat not merely one kind of food but the riches of a feast. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel (Josh. 5:10-12). This indicates that the Lord desires to recover the eating of the proper food by God's people, the food ordained by God and typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us. The degradation of the church distracts God's people from the eating of Christ as their food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. In the church's degradation there are the teaching of Balaam (v. 14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans (v. 15), the teaching by Jezebel (v. 20), and the teaching of the deep things of Satan (v. 24). Now in these epistles the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply. We must eat Him not only as the tree of life and the hidden manna but also as a feast full of His riches. ",
  "8690":"In Greek the word for tree here, as in 1 Pet. 2:24, means wood; it is not the word usually used for tree. In the Bible the tree of life always signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Here it signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood &#151; 1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the life of God &#151; John 11:25) Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God's redeemed people for eternity (22:2, 14). <br><br>   God's original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). Because of the fall, the way to the tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, was opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). But in the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave religion with its knowledge and return to the enjoyment of Himself. This promise of the Lord restores the church to God's original intention according to His economy. What the Lord wants the overcomers to do is what the whole church should do in God's economy. Because of the church's degradation, the Lord came to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishing of God's economy. <br><br>   The eating of the tree of life not only was God's original intention concerning man but also will be the eternal issue of God's redemption. All God's redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as the redeemed's eternal portion for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Because of religion's distraction and the church's degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion's distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God's economy. <br><br>   Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. If we leave our first love toward the Lord, we will miss the enjoyment of Christ and lose the testimony of Jesus; consequently, the lampstand will be removed from us. These three things &#151; loving the Lord, enjoying the Lord, and being the testimony of the Lord &#151; go together. ",
  "8691":"The Paradise in Luke 23:43 is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are (Luke 16:23-26). But the Paradise of God in this verse is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church. This enjoyment of the foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, our nourishment of life in the New Jerusalem for eternity. <br><br>   Strictly, to eat of the tree of life ... in the Paradise of God in this verse refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God's redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a reward given only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church's degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we will be thus rewarded. Otherwise, we will miss this particular enjoyment in the coming kingdom, though we will still enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The Lord's promises concerning the reward and the Lord's predictions concerning the loss, at the end of each of the seven epistles, refer to His dealing with His believers in the coming millennial kingdom. They have nothing to do with the believers' eternal destiny &#151; eternal salvation or eternal perdition. ",
  "8692":"The Greek word means myrrh, and myrrh in figure signifies suffering. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church. It signifies the church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century. ",
  "8693":"In suffering, the church must know that the Lord is the First and the Last, the ever-existing, unchanging One. Whatever the persecuting environment may be, the Lord remains the same; nothing can precede Him, nor can anything exist after Him. All things are within the limits of His control. ",
  "8694":"Lived again refers to resurrection. The Lord suffered death and lived again. He entered into death, but death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24) because He is the resurrection (John 11:25). The suffering church needs to know Him as such a One also, so that she can endure any kind of suffering. However severe the suffering, the church will still be alive. The resurrection life of Christ can endure death. ",
  "8695":"Tribulation is precious to the church because it tests the life of the church. The Lord's purpose in allowing the church to suffer tribulation is not only to testify that His resurrection life overcomes death but also to enable the church to enjoy the riches of His life. ",
  "8696":"The suffering church was poor in material things but rich in the Lord with the riches of His life. ",
  "8697":"The Judaizers slandered the suffering church by evilly criticizing her. They stubbornly insisted on keeping their Judaistic system, consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple, which were all types that had been fulfilled and replaced by Christ. Since the church under the new covenant in God's economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her. In principle, it is the same today, in that religious people slander the churches in the Lord's recovery, which seek the Lord and follow Him in spirit and in life and do not care for any religious system or practice. ",
  "8698":"The Judaizers were Jews in the flesh but not Jews in spirit (Rom. 2:28-29). Merely being the seed of Abraham did not constitute them true Jews. Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God (Rom. 9:7-8). ",
  "8699":"The goal of God's economy is to have a unique temple on earth to testify of God and of the oneness of God's people. In the Old Testament, the place that God chose for the establishing of His unique temple was Jerusalem. Because God's people became fallen, divided, and scattered, numerous fallen, divided centers of worship were raised up; these became the synagogues. These synagogues were the places in which the Jews worshipped God mainly by studying their Scriptures, the Old Testament. However, because of their stubbornness in clinging to their traditional religious concepts, the Jews became one with Satan in opposing God's way of life, by which He fulfills His purpose. Under the manipulating, maneuvering hand of Satan, their synagogues opposed the Lord Jesus (Matt. 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22), then the apostles (Acts 13:43, 45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6), and then the churches. Therefore, the Lord called them \"a synagogue of Satan.\" Even when He was on earth, He considered the synagogues to be of Satan, as implied in Matt. 12:25-29 and John 8:44. Apparently, those in the synagogues were worshipping God; actually, they were opposing God. They persecuted and killed God's true worshippers, yet they considered that they were offering service to God (John 16:2). Through all the centuries since then, religious people have followed in their steps, persecuting those who genuinely seek and follow the Lord in spirit and life, while still considering that they are defending the interests of God. Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, as well as Judaism, all fall into this category, having become an organization of Satan as his tool to damage God's economy. ",
  "8700":"Satan, from Hebrew, means adversary. Satan is not only the enemy of God from without but also His adversary from within. ",
  "8701":"The Greek word means accuser, slanderer (12:9-10). The devil, who is Satan, the adversary of God, accuses us before God and slanders us before men. ",
  "8702":"The number ten signifies fullness; e.g., the ten commandments, which express God's demand in full. Ten days signifies a period of time that is full, yet brief (Gen. 24:55; Jer. 42:7; Dan. 1:12-14). Here it signifies that the affliction of the suffering church was full, yet short-lived. As a sign, the ten days here indicate prophetically the ten periods of persecution that the church suffered under the Roman emperors, beginning with Caesar Nero in the second half of the first century and ending with Constantine the Great in the first part of the fourth century. However severe were the persecutions instigated by the devil, Satan, through the Roman Caesars, who did their utmost to destroy and eliminate the church, they could not subdue and terminate the church. History demonstrates that the church of the living Christ, who became dead and lived again, withstood the persecutions victoriously and multiplied flourishingly by the indestructible resurrection life. ",
  "8703":"A crown in New Testament usage always denotes a prize that is in addition to salvation (see reference 10j). The crown of life, as a prize to those who are faithful unto death in overcoming persecution, denotes the overcoming strength that is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10); it also denotes that these overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead (Phil. 3:11), i.e., the outstanding resurrection. ",
  "8704":"In this epistle to overcome is to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death. ",
  "8705":"Because of the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once (Heb. 9:27). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. All the dead, except those who through faith in the Lord Jesus have been recorded in the book of life, will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment of the great white throne at the close of the millennium, i.e., at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth. As a result of this judgment, the condemned ones will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement (20:11-15). Hence, the second death is God's dealing with man after man's death and resurrection. Since the overcomers will have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and will require no further dealing by God after their resurrection, they will be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death after their resurrection; i.e., they will not be hurt by the second death. ",
  "8706":"The Greek word means marriage (implying union) and fortified tower. As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, equivalent to the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed (Matt. 13:31-32). When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine's welcoming of Christianity as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine's encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelievers were baptized into the \"church,\" and the \"church\" became monstrously great. Since the church as a chaste bride is espoused to Christ, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God. ",
  "8707":"Satan's throne is in the world, the place where he dwells and the sphere of his reign. Since the worldly church entered into union with the world, she dwells where Satan dwells. ",
  "8708":"The Lord's name denotes the Lord's person; the person is the reality of the name. The Lord's faith denotes all that we must believe in concerning the Lord's person and work. It does not denote the subjective faith within us, i.e., our believing, but the objective faith, i.e., the things in which we believe. Because the church entered into union with the world, she began to disregard the Lord's name and deny the proper Christian faith. ",
  "8709":"In Greek Antipas means against all. Antipas, a faithful witness of the Lord, stood against all that the worldly church brought in and practiced. Hence, he became a martyr of the Lord. In Greek the word for martyr is the same as that for witness. Antipas, as an anti-witness, bore an anti-testimony, a testimony against anything that deviated from the testimony of Jesus. It must have been through his anti-testimony that in his days the church in Pergamos still held fast the Lord's name and did not deny the proper Christian faith. ",
  "8710":"In these epistles the Lord desired, according to God's economy, that we eat Him as the tree of life (v. 7), the hidden manna (v. 17), and the rich produce of the good land (3:20; see note 7 in this chapter); but the worldly church turned from life to mere teachings, thus distracting the believers from enjoying Christ as their life supply for the fulfillment of God's purpose. The enjoyment of Christ builds up the church, whereas teachings issue in a religion. ",
  "8711":"Balaam was a Gentile prophet who for wages enticed God's people into fornication and idolatry (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). In the worldly church some began to teach such things. ",
  "8712":"Idolatry always brings in fornication (Num. 25:1-3; Acts 15:29). When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication. ",
  "8713":"The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication, whereas the teaching of the Nicolaitans destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body as His expression. The former teaching disregards the Head, and the latter destroys the Body. This is the subtle intention of the enemy in all religious teachings. <br><br>   In the church in Ephesus only the works of the Nicolaitans were found (v. 6), whereas in the church in Pergamos their works had progressed to become a teaching. First, the Nicolaitans practiced the hierarchy in the initial church; then they taught it in the degraded church. Today, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, this Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching. ",
  "8714":"See note 6. ",
  "8715":"This should refer not to the Lord's coming back but to His coming to war with the Nicolaitan teachers in the degraded church, when He will judge the degraded church with the slaying word out of His mouth. However, the worldly church, signified by the church in Pergamos, issued in the Roman Catholic Church, signified by the church in Thyatira, and the worldliness and evil brought in by that degraded church will continue in the Roman Catholic Church until the Lord comes back to exercise His full judgment. ",
  "8716":"Here to overcome is specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of hierarchy. ",
  "8717":"Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). The open manna was for the Lord's people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is being fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom. ",
  "8718":"In the Bible a stone signifies material for God's building (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). In our natural being we are not stones but clay. Because we received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (2 Cor. 3:18). If we do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. These stones will be justified and approved by the Lord, as indicated by the color white, while the worldly church will be condemned and rejected by Him. God's work of building the church depends on our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply. ",
  "8719":"A name designates a person; a new name designates a transformed person. Every transformed believer, as a white stone, bears \"a new name ... which no one knows except him who receives it.\" Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one who has been transformed. Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name. ",
  "8720":"The Greek word means sacrifice of perfume, or unceasing sacrifice. As a sign, the church in Thyatira prefigures the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully formed as the apostate church by the establishing of the universal papal system in the latter part of the sixth century. This apostate church is full of sacrifices, as demonstrated in her continual Masses. ",
  "8721":"The apostate Roman Catholic Church strongly emphasizes Christ as the son of Mary. Thus, here the Lord, protesting against the apostate heresy, said that He is the Son of God. ",
  "8722":"Lit., His eyes. In dealing with the worldly church, the church in Pergamos, the Lord referred to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. In dealing with the apostate church, the church in Thyatira, He referred to Himself as the One who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze. The worldly church requires the dealing of His smiting and killing word, whereas the apostate church needs the judging of His searching eyes and treading feet. ",
  "8723":"The apostate Catholic Church has many works and services. Her works in the last days are more than those in the past. ",
  "8724":"The woman here is the same as the one prophesied by the Lord in Matt. 13:33. There the woman added leaven (signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things) into the fine flour (signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man). This woman is the great harlot of Rev. 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things. Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of this apostate church (see reference 20). ",
  "8725":"A prophet is one who speaks for God with God's authority. Here the Lord used Jezebel as a type, indicating that the apostate Roman Catholic Church is a self-appointed prophetess, one who presumes to be authorized by God to speak for God. ",
  "8726":"The church in Pergamos had the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, and these are continued in this apostate church. Furthermore, the Catholic Church herself teaches, causing her people to listen to her rather than to the holy Word of God. Her adherents are all drugged by her heretical, religious teaching and thus do not care for Christ as their life and life supply, indicated by the tree of life and the hidden manna, which the Lord promised to the churches in Ephesus and Pergamos (vv. 7, 17). ",
  "8727":"The apostate church is filled with all manner of fornication and idolatry, both spiritual and physical. In ch. 17 she is even called \"the great harlot.\" ",
  "8728":"A bed is normally used for sleep and rest, and abnormally, for sickness. The Lord indicated here that the apostate church is incurably sick and will remain so until her final judgment. ",
  "8729":"Not the tribulation that the church has suffered throughout the centuries of persecution (7:14) nor the great tribulation in the last three and a half years of this age, which will fall upon all those who dwell on the earth (Matt. 24:21), but the particular portion of affliction that the Lord will cause the apostate Roman Catholic Church to suffer when He judges her. See note 23. ",
  "8730":"This may refer to God's destroying of the Roman Catholic Church through Antichrist and his followers (17:16-17). ",
  "8731":"Lit., kidneys. ",
  "8732":"In Greek the word for deep things means depths, as in Eph. 3:18. It is used figuratively here and denotes mysterious things. The Roman Catholic Church has many mysteries or deep doctrines. The synagogue of Satan (v. 9) was against the suffering church; the throne of Satan (v. 13) was with the worldly church; and the deep things of Satan are within the apostate church. The religion of the synagogue, the world under Satan's throne, and the philosophy of the satanic mysteries are all used by Satan to damage and corrupt the church. ",
  "8733":"This indicates that the apostate Roman Catholic Church will remain until the Lord comes back. ",
  "8734":"To overcome here is to overcome Roman Catholicism. ",
  "8735":"My works refers to the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing. These works are in contrast to the works of the apostate church, which are carried out under the influence of Satan. ",
  "8736":"To reign with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom is a prize to the overcomers (20:4, 6). This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to overcome degraded Christianity will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom. ",
  "8737":"In the millennial kingdom, the ruler is a shepherd. ",
  "8738":"In Psa. 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations; here Christ gives the same authority to His overcomers. ",
  "8739":"At Christ's first appearing the magi, not the Jewish religionists, saw Christ's star (Matt. 2:2, 9-10). At His second appearing Christ will be the morning star to His overcomers who watch for His coming. To all the others He will appear only as the sun (Mal. 4:2). ",
  "8740":"The number seven in the Bible is composed either of six plus one, e.g., six days plus one day equals one week; or of three plus four, as in these two chapters, in which the seven churches are divided into one group of three and another group of four. At the end of each of the first three epistles, the ear for hearing is mentioned first, and then the call for overcoming. At the end of each of the last four epistles, the order is reversed. This proves that the first three epistles form one group, and the last four another. Six plus one is seen in God's creation, whereas three plus four is seen in God's new creation, the church. Since all things were created in six days, the number six signifies the creation, especially man, who was created on the sixth day; and since the seventh day, as the conclusion of the six days, was the one day of God's rest, the number one signifies the unique Creator. Hence, six plus one signifies that all things were created unto God for the accomplishing of His purpose. The unique Creator, God, is triune, signified by the number three. Since the creation is represented before God by four living creatures (4:6-9), the number four signifies the creatures, especially man. Hence, three plus four means that God is added to the created man, and thus His purpose is being accomplished. The church is not only the creature but the creature with the Creator as the Triune God dispensed into her. She is the real number seven: the real three, the Triune God, added to the real four, created man. Therefore, the number seven denotes completion in God's move, first in the old creation and then in the new creation, the church. ",
  "8741":"The Greek word means the remains, the remainder, or the restoration. As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant church, from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. The Reformation was God's reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, which is signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. It was accomplished by a minority of the believers, the remainder. Hence, it was a restoration by the remainder. ",
  "8742":"The seven Spirits of God enable the church to be intensely living, and the seven stars enable her to be intensely shining. To the church in Ephesus, Christ was the One who held the seven stars and walked in the midst of the seven lampstands. The initial church needed the care of Christ, and her leaders needed His keeping grace. To the church in Smyrna, He was the One who became dead and lived again. The suffering church needed the resurrection life of Christ. To the church in Pergamos, Christ was the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. The degraded, worldly church needed His judging and slaying word. To the church in Thyatira, He was the One who has eyes like flaming fire and feet like shining bronze. The apostate church needed His searching and judging. Here, to the church in Sardis, He was the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. The dead, reformed church needed the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God and the shining leaders. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is living and can never be replaced by the dead letters of knowledge (2 Cor. 3:6). ",
  "8743":"Many have considered the reformed Protestant Church to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, she needs the living Spirits and the shining stars. ",
  "8744":"\"The things which remain\" are the things that had been lost and were restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith, the open Bible, etc. Though these things had been restored, they were about to die. Hence, they needed to be revived. This is the actual situation of the Protestant churches. ",
  "8745":"Nothing begun in the Reformation has ever been completed. Therefore, the church in Philadelphia is needed for the completion. ",
  "8746":"A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. Since the reformed Protestant churches are dead, they will be unaware of the Lord's coming as a thief in His secret appearing to His seekers. Hence, there is the need of watchfulness. ",
  "8747":"Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living. To defile one's garments means particularly to stain them with deadness. Death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6-7, 9). ",
  "8748":"White signifies not only purity but also approvedness. White garments here signify the walk and living that are unspotted by death and that will be approved by the Lord. This is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom. ",
  "8749":"To overcome here is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, i.e., to overcome dead Protestantism. ",
  "8750":"Being clothed in white garments, as promised here, will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. What they have been walking in in this age will be a prize to them in the coming age. Every Christian needs two garments. The first is the garment of justification for our salvation, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we received, as our objective righteousness (Luke 15:22; 1 Cor. 1:30). The second is the garment of approvedness for our acceptance, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we live out, as our subjective righteousness (Phil. 1:21; 3:9). The white garments mentioned here refer to the second garment, which is needed for us to receive the reward and enter into the kingdom to walk with the Lord, that is, to reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:11-12). See note 8 in ch. 19. ",
  "8751":"The entire verse is the Lord's promise to the overcomers. It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after the Lord comes back. That a name is erased out of the book of life indicates that that name has already been written in the book of life. The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book (Luke 10:20). These blessings are in three stages: (1) in the church, (2) in the millennial kingdom, and (3) in eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, the divine nature, etc., are the initial portions. All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they cooperate with God's supplying grace, they will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward them at His coming back. That prize will be the entrance into the millennial kingdom and participation in the divine blessings in that stage, such as the joy and rest of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23; Heb. 4:9-11), the reign over the nations (2:26-27; 20:4, 6), etc., which God has prepared as an incentive for His chosen ones to go on with Him in the church age. However, many of His chosen ones, after receiving His forgiveness, redemption, eternal life, divine nature, etc., will not cooperate with His grace and will not go on with Him. Hence, they are unable to mature in life in the church age and thus will not be ready at the Lord's coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessings of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity, such as the eternal priesthood with God's eter-nal presence, the eternal kingship (22:3-5), the New Jerusalem, the tree of life (22:14), the water of life (22:17), etc. At that time their names should again be written in the book of life. This means that all God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church \"shall by no means perish forever,\" (John 10:28); that is, they shall by no means lose the divine blessings of eternity. But some, those who do not cooperate with the Lord in the church age, will be dispensationally disciplined by the Lord during the millennial kingdom and will miss the divine blessings in that stage. ",
  "8752":"Lit., scroll. ",
  "8753":"In the kingdom age the Lord will confess the name of the overcomer because the overcomer's name will not have been erased out of the book of life but will still be written in it. This implies that if the believers are not overcomers, in the kingdom age their names will be erased out of the book of life (see note 5) and therefore will not be confessed by the Lord. ",
  "8754":"The Greek word means brotherly love. As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love was a reaction to the dead reformed church. This reaction will continue as an anti- testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back. ",
  "8755":"To the church of brotherly love, the Lord is the Holy One, the true One, by whom and with whom the recovered church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God. ",
  "8756":"To the recovered church, the Lord is also the One who has the key of David, the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut. The Lord uses this key to deal with the recovered church. ",
  "8757":"As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one will shut, the Lord has given the recovered church an opened door, which no one can shut. Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been opened wide to the Lord's recovery. The more organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is opened. In spite of much opposition, today the door is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers. ",
  "8758":"This indicates that what pleases the Lord is not our doing much for Him but our doing our best for Him with what we have. ",
  "8759":"The Lord's word is the Lord's expression, and the Lord's name is the Lord Himself. The apostate church has deviated from the Lord's word and become heretical. The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord's word to some extent, has denied the Lord's name by denominating herself, taking many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. The recovered church not only has returned in a full way to the Lord's word but also has abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). To deviate from the Lord's word is apostasy, and to denominate the church by taking any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication. The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2), should have no name other than her Husband's. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God. In the recovered church life there are no teachings of Balaam (2:14), no teachings of the Nicolaitans (2:15), no teachings of Jezebel (2:20), and no mysterious doctrines of Satan (2:24); there is only the pure word of the Lord. The recovered church has no denominations (names); it has only the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The deviation from the word to heresies and the exalting of many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. The return to the pure word from all heresies and traditions and the exalting of the Lord's name by abandoning every other name constitute the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church. This is why the church in the Lord's recovery has the revelation and presence of the Lord and expresses the Lord in a living way, full of light and with the riches of life. ",
  "8760":"See note 9 in ch. 2. ",
  "8761":"See note 9 in ch. 2. ",
  "8762":"The Jewish synagogue holds on to Judaism, which comprises the mediatorial priests, the ordinances of letters, the material temple, and the earthly promises. The recovered church has subdued Judaism by exposing its error and stubbornness in holding on to the above four things and has caused the Jews to know that the Lord has loved her. ",
  "8763":"The word of the Lord's endurance is the word of the Lord's suffering. The Lord today is still bearing rejection and persecution by His endurance. We are the joint partakers not only of His kingdom but also of His endurance (1:9). Hence, His word to us today is the word of endurance. To keep the word of His endurance, we must bear His rejection and persecution. ",
  "8764":"Trial here undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, as indicated by the fifth trumpet, the sixth trumpet, and the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet (8:13--9:21; 11:14-15; 15:1; 16:1-21). The trial also includes the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets at the beginning of the great tribulation. The Lord promised the recovered church that He would keep her out of the hour of trial (not only out of the trial, but out of the hour of trial) because she has kept the word of the Lord's endurance. This promise of the Lord, like His promise in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who keep the word of the Lord's endurance will be raptured before the great trial, implying that those who do not keep the word of the Lord's endurance will be left in the trial. ",
  "8765":"In this epistle the Lord brings the church in His recovery into the sensation of His coming, because she loves Him. ",
  "8766":"The recovered church has gained the crown already. However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone. ",
  "8767":"To overcome here is to hold fast what we have in the recovered church. ",
  "8768":"In 2:17 the overcomer will become a transformed stone for God's building. Here the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God. Because he is built into God's building, he shall by no means go out anymore. This promise, as a prize to the overcomer, will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. ",
  "8769":"That the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord's new name are written upon the overcomer indicates that the overcomer is possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord; that God Himself, His city (the New Jerusalem), and the Lord Himself all belong to him; and that he is one with God, with the New Jerusalem, and with the Lord. The name of God denotes God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem denotes the city itself, and the name of the Lord denotes the Lord Himself. That the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the name of the Lord are written upon the overcomer indicates that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomer. The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity. ",
  "8770":"The Greek word means opinion, judgment, of the people or of the laymen. As a sign, the church in Laodicea prefigures the degraded recovered church. Less than one century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered \"assemblies\" (called such by the Brethren) became degraded. The degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church, signified by the church in Sardis, and from the proper recovered church, signified by the church in Philadelphia. It will exist until the Lord comes back. ",
  "8771":"In addressing each of the seven churches, the Lord referred to what He is and what He does, respectively, according to the situation and condition of each. Here, in addressing the church in Laodicea, He referred to Himself as \"the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.\" Amen, from Hebrew, means firm, steadfast, or trustworthy. The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Hence, He is the faithful and true Witness. This indicates that the degraded church in Laodicea is not firm, steadfast, trustworthy, or faithful and true as the Lord's witness. The beginning of the creation of God refers to the Lord as the origin or source of God's creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God's work. This indicates that the degraded recovered church has changed by leaving the Lord as the source. ",
  "8772":"Or, origin, source; that is, the originating source. ",
  "8773":"Lit., boiling. So in the next verse. ",
  "8774":"To be spewed out of the Lord's mouth is to be rejected by the Lord and to lose the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to His church. ",
  "8775":"The degraded recovered church boasts of her riches (which are mainly in the knowledge of doctrines). She does not realize that she is poor in life, blind in sight, and naked in conduct. Therefore, she needs to buy gold to make herself rich, white garments to cover her nakedness, and eyesalve to cure her blindness, as mentioned in the next verse. ",
  "8776":"In the eyes of the Lord the degraded recovered church is (1) wretched because she is proud of being rich in the vain knowledge of doctrine, but in reality is sorely poor in the experience of the riches of Christ; (2) miserable because she is naked, blind, and full of shame and darkness; (3) poor because she is poor in the experience of Christ and in the spiritual reality of God's economy; (4) blind because she lacks true spiritual insight in the genuine spiritual things; and (5) naked because she does not live by Christ or live Christ as her subjective righteousness, as the second garment in her daily walk. ",
  "8777":"Buying requires the paying of a price. The degraded recovered church must pay a price for gold, white garments, and eyesalve, which she desperately needs. ",
  "8778":"In the Bible our operating, working faith (Gal. 5:6) is likened to gold (1 Pet. 1:7), and the divine nature of God, which is the divinity of Christ, is typified by gold (Exo. 25:11). By faith we partake of the divine nature of God (2 Pet. 1:1, 4-5). The degraded recovered church has the knowledge of the doctrines concerning Christ but not much living faith to partake of the divine element of Christ. She needs to pay the price to gain the golden faith through the fiery trials that she may participate in the real gold, which is Christ Himself as the life element to His Body. Thus she can become a pure golden lampstand (1:20) for the building of the golden New Jerusalem (21:18). ",
  "8779":"In figure, garments signify conduct. White garments here signify conduct that can be approved by the Lord. Such conduct is the Lord Himself lived out of the church, and it is required by the degraded recovered church for the covering of her nakedness. ",
  "8780":"The eyesalve needed to anoint their eyes must be the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27), who is the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The degraded recovered church needs this kind of eyesalve also for the healing of her blindness. For the three items mentioned in this verse, she must pay the price. ",
  "8781":"Lit., boiling. Dead, vain knowledge and doctrinal forms have made the degraded recovered church lukewarm. She needs to repent of her lukewarmness and be zealous, boiling, burning, that thereby she may regain the enjoyment of the reality of Christ. ",
  "8782":"This door is not the door of the hearts of individuals but the door of the church. The Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door. The degraded recovered church must realize this! ",
  "8783":"The door is the door of the church, but the door is opened by individual believers. The church in Laodicea has knowledge but does not have the Lord's presence. The Lord is dealing with the whole church, but the acceptance of the Lord's dealing must be a personal matter. The Lord's dealing is objective, but the believers' acceptance must be subjective. ",
  "8784":"The Greek word denotes taking the principal meal of the day at evening. See note 7 in ch. 2. ",
  "8785":"Here to overcome is to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to pay the price to buy the needed items, and to open the door so that the Lord can come in. ",
  "8786":"To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer, that he may participate in the Lord's authority and be a co-king with Him in ruling over the whole earth in the coming millennial kingdom. ",
  "8787":"The seven churches not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven ages, as we have seen, but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church. The initial church had its continuation in the suffering church; the suffering church became the worldly church; and the worldly church became the apostate church. Hence, the first four churches issued eventually in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. Then the reformed church, as a reaction to the apostate church, came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered. Hence, after this, the recovered church was raised up as a full recovery of the proper church life. This can be considered the third kind of church. Through the degradation of the recovered church, the degraded recovered church came into being. This can be counted as the fourth kind of church. These four kinds of churches will all remain until the Lord comes back. Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God's eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after. We must take the Lord's choice. ",
  "8788":"God's plan is hidden in heaven. When God finds a man on earth after His heart, heaven is opened to him. It was opened to Jacob (Gen. 28:12-17), to Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1), to Jesus (Matt. 3:16), to Stephen (Acts 7:56), and to Peter (Acts 10:11). Here and in 19:11 it was opened to John, the writer of this book, and it will be opened to all believers in the Lord in eternity (John 1:51). ",
  "8789":"The voice heard in 1:10. ",
  "8790":"See note 10 in ch. 1. ",
  "8791":"In this book the throne of God is the center of God's administration. In the Epistles the throne is the throne of grace, from which we receive mercy and find grace (Heb. 4:16). In this book the throne is the throne of judgment, from which the world receives judgment. Eventually, after all God's judgments have been executed, the throne of God will be the throne of the supply of eternal life, out of which will proceed the living water of life, in which the tree of life grows, as the supply of God's redeemed in eternity. ",
  "8792":"According to 21:11, the jasper is \"a most precious stone ... as clear as crystal.\" Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as indicated in 21:11, signifies God's communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2). God's appearance is like jasper, as also the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem, will be (21:11). The city's wall and first foundation are built with jasper (21:18-19). ",
  "8793":"The sardius too is a most precious stone, and its red color signifies redemption. While jasper signifies God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption. On the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament, the first stone was a sardius and the last a jasper (Exo. 28:17, 20). This signifies that God's redeemed people have their beginning in God's redemption and their consummation in God's glory of life. ",
  "8794":"The rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with man and all living creatures that He will not destroy them again with a flood (Gen. 9:8-17). This book shows that God will judge the earth with all its inhabitants. The rainbow around His throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His covenant while executing His judgment upon the earth. He will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep a part of mankind to be the nations on the new earth for His glory (21:24, 26). ",
  "8795":"The rainbow around God's throne is like an emerald in appearance. An emerald is a precious stone whose grass-green color signifies the lives on earth. This indicates that as God is executing His judgment upon the earth, He will remember His covenant and will spare some of the lives on earth, as indicated in Gen. 9:11. ",
  "8796":"Twenty-four is formed by multiplying twelve by two. Twelve indicates the completion of God's administration (Matt. 19:28). David divided both the priests and the Levites into twenty-four groups to carry out God's administrative service. Therefore, before they are replaced by the church, the twenty-four angelic elders are the ones who carry out God's administration. Twelve multiplied by two signifies strengthening by doubling, indicating that the divine administration carried out by the twenty-four angelic elders is strong. ",
  "8797":"The elders here are not the elders of the church but the elders of the angels, because here, before the Lord's second coming, they are sitting on thrones already (cf. Matt. 19:28; Rev. 20:4). Among God's creation the angels are the most ancient ones. Their elders are the elders of the whole creation of God. That they sit on thrones with golden crowns on their heads indicates that they must be the ones who rule the universe until the millennial kingdom, when the authority to rule the earth will be given to the overcoming saints (Heb. 2:5-9; Rev. 2:26-27; 20:4). That they are clothed in white garments and have a harp and golden bowls full of incense (5:8) indicates that now they are also priests before God; in the millennial kingdom, however, the reigning overcomers will be the priests of God and of Christ (20:6). The elders' golden crowns indicate that they are also ruling ones. Therefore, they are priests serving God and kings reigning over His creation. ",
  "8798":"The white garments here indicate that these angelic elders are sinless and, unlike the redeemed saints, have no need to be washed by the blood of the Lamb (7:14). ",
  "8799":"The seven lamps here are based upon the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exo. 25:37 and Zech. 4:2. The seven lamps of fire, which are the seven Spirits of God, signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. In Exo. 25 and Zech. 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God's move, are for God's building, either for the building of the tabernacle or for the rebuilding of the temple. Here the seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue also in God's building &#151; the building of the New Jerusalem. ",
  "8800":"See note 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "8801":"This glassy sea is not of water but of fire (15:2). Since the deluge, God, in accordance with His promise that He would not judge the earth and all living creatures again with water (Gen. 9:15), always exercises His judgment upon man with fire (Gen. 19:24; Lev. 10:2; Num. 11:1; 16:35; Dan. 7:11; Rev. 14:10; 18:8; 19:20; 20:9-10; 21:8). God's throne of judgment is like the fiery flame out of which a fiery stream issues (Dan. 7:9-10). The flame of God's judging fire sweeps all negative things in the entire universe into this glassy sea, which eventually becomes the lake of fire (20:14). The glassy sea, being the aggregate of all God's fiery judgment, is like crystal, signifying that every negative thing under God's judgment is crystal clear. Here we have the rainbow around the throne of God, signifying that God will keep His promise recorded in Gen. 9:8-17. We also have the glassy sea of fire, indicating that God will judge all negative things still with fire. ",
  "8802":"The twenty-four elders around the throne of God represent all the angels, whereas the four living creatures represent all other living creatures. The first, which is like a lion, represents the beasts; the second, which is like a calf, represents the cattle; the third, which is like a man, represents mankind; and the fourth, which is like an eagle, represents the fowl (v. 7). Of the six categories of living things created by God (Gen. 1:20-28), two are not represented here &#151; the creeping things on the earth and the living things in the water. The head of the creeping things is the serpent, a symbol of God's enemy, Satan, who will be cast into the lake of fire and will have no place in the new heaven and new earth. The living things in the water are in the water of God's judgment, which will no longer exist in the new heaven and new earth (21:1). Hence, for eternity these two categories are not represented before God. <br><br>   Among the four living creatures, the calf is clean, but the lion and the eagle are unclean (Lev. 11:3, 27, 13-19). After being redeemed, they all became clean (Acts 10:11-16). Among them the calf and the man are meek and gentle, but the lion and eagle are wild and fierce. Through redemption they can all dwell together (Isa. 11:6-9). Christ's redemption is not only for man but for all things (Col. 1:20), for He died on behalf of everything (Heb. 2:9). ",
  "8803":"Eyes enable living things to receive light and vision. The four living creatures are full of eyes, not only in front and behind but also around and within (v. 8), indicating that they are absolutely not opaque but are crystal clear in every aspect. In the presence of God we, the redeemed people, should be like this. ",
  "8804":"In appearance, the four living creatures resemble the cherubim in Ezek. 1:5-10 and 10:14-15. In that they each have six wings (v. 8), they are like the seraphim in Isa. 6:2. (The cherubim in Exo. 25:20 and 1 Kings 6:27 have two wings, and the cherubim in Ezek. 1:6 have four wings.) They must be a combination of the cherubim and the seraphim. As the seraphim, they are for God's holiness (Isa. 6:3), referring to God's nature, and as the cherubim, they are for God's glory (Ezek. 10:18-19; Heb. 9:5), referring to God's expression. Hence, they stand for God's nature and expression. ",
  "8805":"The mentioning of holy three times, as in Isa. 6:3, implies that God is triune. ",
  "8806":"The use of three tenses in speaking of God's existence also implies that God is triune. See note 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "8807":"The praises of both the four living creatures in this verse and the twenty-four elders in v. 11 are composed of three items, implying that both the living creatures and the elders are praising the Triune God. The first two items, glory and honor, are the same in both places, but the last item is different: In the praises of the four living creatures the last item is thanks &#151; they are redeemed and are grateful for the redemption of God's grace; whereas in the praises of the twenty-four elders the last item is power &#151; as the rulers of the universe (they are not the redeemed creatures), they appreciate the power of God, by which they rule. ",
  "8808":"According to the preceding verses, this section of the holy Word implies that when the redeemed saints &#151; represented by the man among the four living creatures, who are redeemed &#151; have been perfected and glorified to be the proper priests and kings (20:6), the temporary priests and kings, the twenty-four angelic elders, will resign from their offices. This is implied by the fact that they will cast their crowns before the throne. ",
  "8809":"See note 9. ",
  "8810":"God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure. He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose. This book, which unveils God's universal administration, shows us the purpose of God. Hence, in the twenty-four elders' praise to God concerning His creation, His creation is related to His will. ",
  "8811":"This scroll must be the new covenant, the grand title deed in the universe, enacted with the blood of the Lamb for God's redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe. This book is a record of God's thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe. ",
  "8812":"The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed up are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation is just the opening, the unveiling, of the seven seals. ",
  "8813":"If actually no one in the whole universe was found worthy to open the scroll, we would surely need to weep, for the whole universe would be vanity, with none qualified to unveil its secret. ",
  "8814":"The lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy, as prophesied in Gen. 49:8-9. Christ's overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals. ",
  "8815":"The title Root of David (He is also the Root of David's father, Jesse &#151; Isa. 11:1) signifies that Christ is the source of David. Therefore, David, His forefather, called Him \"Lord\" (Matt. 22:42-45). ",
  "8816":"As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ overcame and defeated the rebellious Satan, the enemy of God, and as the redeeming Lamb, He took away the sin of fallen man. By so doing, He removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God's purpose. Therefore, He is worthy to open the scroll concerning God's economy. ",
  "8817":"In ch. 4 is the scene in the heavens, its center being the throne of God, on which God sits, ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Here in ch. 5 is the same scene in the heavens after Christ ascended there. He was recommended to the apostle John as the Lion of the tribe of Judah by one of the elders, but He appeared to John as a Lamb. As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. He fought to redeem us, and He won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us. To the enemy He is a Lion; to us He is a Lamb. Hence, He is the Lion-Lamb. ",
  "8818":"As far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down at the right hand of God in the heavens after His ascension (Heb. 1:3; 10:12), whereas regarding the carrying out of God's administration, He is still standing in His ascension. ",
  "8819":"Having just been slain indicates that the Lamb had just been slain and also that the scene in the heavens that is depicted in this chapter took place immediately after Christ's ascension into the heavens. ",
  "8820":"Horns signify strength in fighting (Deut. 33:17). Christ is the redeeming Lamb, yet He has horns for fighting. He is the fighting Redeemer. His fighting is complete (perfect and complete) in God's move, as signified by the number seven. ",
  "8821":"Eyes are for observing and searching. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God's judgment upon the universe to fulfill God's eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in Zech. 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, the topstone (Zech. 4:7, lit.) with seven eyes for God's building. These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth (Zech. 4:10). See note 14 in ch. 1. ",
  "8822":"According to Greek grammar, the antecedent of which is seven eyes. Hence, the seven Spirits of God refer only to the seven eyes of the Lamb, and not to His seven horns. ",
  "8823":"The bowls are the saints' prayers brought to God by the angelic elders (cf. 8:3-4), whereas the incense is Christ added to the saints' prayers. See note 3 in ch. 8. That in their worship to God the twenty-four angelic elders are holding the golden bowls full of incense shows that they, as priests, are ministering to God by bringing the saints' prayers to Him. ",
  "8824":"Lit., incenses. ",
  "8825":"The song here is new because the Lamb whom it praises had just been slain. ",
  "8826":"In the whole universe no one is worthy to open the mystery of God's economy but Christ, the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb. As the overcoming Lion, He defeated Satan for God, and as the redeeming Lamb, He put sin away for us. He is the only One qualified to unveil and carry out the mystery of God's economy. ",
  "8827":"Lit., in. ",
  "8828":"Them refers to the redeemed ones (v. 9). That the twenty-four elders referred to these redeemed ones as them in their praise proves that the praising elders are not of the church but of the angels. ",
  "8829":"The kingdom is for kingship, for the exercising of God's authority, and the priests are for the priesthood, for the accomplishing of the divine ministry. ",
  "8830":"Or, over. ",
  "8831":"The many angels, represented by the twenty-four elders, follow the elders to render to the Lamb the angelic praise. ",
  "8832":"All the creatures, who are represented by the four living creatures, follow the living creatures to give the Lamb the universal praise of all creatures other than the angels. ",
  "8833":"The opening of the seven seals by the Lamb occurred immediately after Christ ascended to the heavens. Through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ became fully qualified in His ascension to open the mystery of God's economy, which is contained in the seven seals. ",
  "8834":"Because God's economy concerning the creatures is contained in the seven seals, the four living creatures are interested in announcing, respectively, the opening of the first four seals. ",
  "8835":"White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable. The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable in the eyes of both man and God. ",
  "8836":"The first four seals consist of four horses with their riders, as in a four-horse race. The four riders are not persons but personified things. It is evident that the rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war (v. 4), that the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine (v. 5), and that the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death (v. 8). According to historical facts, the rider of the first horse, the white horse, must be the gospel, not Christ or Antichrist as some interpret. Immediately after Christ's ascension, these four things &#151; the gospel, war, famine, and death &#151; began to run like riders on four horses, and they will continue until Christ comes back. Beginning from the first century the gospel has been spreading throughout all these twenty centuries. Simultaneously, war among the human race has been proceeding. War has always caused famine, and famine issues in death. All these will continue until the end of this age. ",
  "8837":"A bow with an arrow is for fighting. But here there is a bow without an arrow. This indicates that the arrow has already been shot to destroy the enemy and that the victory has been won for the constituting of the gospel of peace. Now the fighting is over, and the gospel of peace is being proclaimed in a peaceful way. ",
  "8838":"A crown is a sign of glory. The gospel has been crowned with the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4). ",
  "8839":"Or, overcoming and to overcome. Throughout all the centuries, wherever the gospel has been proclaimed, it has conquered and overcome all kinds of opposition and attack. ",
  "8840":"Some ancient MSS omit, I saw, and behold. ",
  "8841":"Red here signifies the shedding of blood. The red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood. ",
  "8842":"To take peace from the earth, men should slay one another, and to him a great sword was given all clearly indicate war. ",
  "8843":"Black here, indicating dearth (Jer. 14:1-4), signifies the color of the visage of famished people (Lam. 4:8-9; 5:9-10). The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes people to have a black visage. ",
  "8844":"A balance is a scale used to weigh precious things. But here it is used to weigh food (see v. 6), thus showing that food is scarce (cf. Lev. 26:26; Ezek. 4:16). ",
  "8845":"A dry measure almost equal to a quart. ",
  "8846":"A denarius (singular for denarii) was the chief silver coin of the Romans; it was considered good pay for a day's labor (cf. Matt. 20:2). ",
  "8847":"Oil and wine are for man's pleasure (Psa. 104:15). They are always in short supply and become precious in a famine. During the famine, oil and wine should be preserved and not harmed. ",
  "8848":"Or, pale green; signifying the facial color of those stricken with the plague. The pale horse is a symbol of the killing of death, which causes a pale appearance. ",
  "8849":"Hades is the place under the earth where the souls of the unsaved dead are kept before the dead are resurrected for the judgment of the great white throne (20:11-15). After this judgment the unsaved will be cast into the lake of fire for eternity. Hades can be likened to a temporary jail, and the lake of fire to a permanent prison. Here Hades follows death to receive those whom death kills. ",
  "8850":"Or, pestilence. ",
  "8851":"To be killed by beasts is God's judgment (2 Kings 2:24; 17:25; Num. 21:6). ",
  "8852":"The seven seals are divided, first, into groups of four and three and, second, into groups of six and one. The number four signifies the creatures, symbolized by the four living creatures, and the number six signifies creation (creation was completed in six days). The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number one signifies the unique God. Hence, both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals, through God's judgment, bring God's creation, with all the creatures, to God. <br><br>   The fifth seal discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age. (This may include the martyrdom of the Old Testament saints &#151; Matt. 23:34-36.) While the preaching of the gospel, as indicated by the first seal, is progressing, the faithful saints are continually being martyred. ",
  "8853":"In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth. Hence, the area underneath the altar is the region underneath the earth, where the souls of the martyred saints are. It is the Paradise to which the Lord Jesus went after His death (Luke 23:43). It is in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40) and is a section of Hades (Acts 2:27), the comfortable section, where Abraham is (Luke 16:22-26). ",
  "8854":"According to the word \"yet a little while, until also the number ... is completed\" (v. 11), this cry of the martyred saints must occur near the end of this age. ",
  "8855":"The white robes here signify that their martyrdom was approved by God. ",
  "8856":"This will be the martyrdom during the great tribulation (20:4). ",
  "8857":"The sixth seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal and is a warning to those who dwell on the earth. According to Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets (9:1-11). Joel 2:30-31 first mentions the blood of the first and second trumpets, the fire of the first, second, and third trumpets (8:7-10), and the smoke of the fifth trumpet (9:1-3), and then mentions the sun and moon of the sixth seal. A comparison of 9:4 and 7:3 indicates that the fifth trumpet occurs very close to the time of the sixth seal. ",
  "8858":"There will be two calamities of the shaking and changing of the earth and the hosts in heaven. The first will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation (Joel 2:30-31), and the second will occur after the great tribulation (Joel 3:11-16; Matt. 24:29-30; Luke 21:25-26). What is covered in the sixth seal is the first calamity. It can be considered not only a warning but also an initiation of the coming great tribulation. ",
  "8859":"Lit., captains over 1,000 men. ",
  "8860":"They say this according to the feeling of their conscience, fearing the coming of the judgment of God. It is not a proclamation of God concerning the coming of His judgment. ",
  "8861":"This chapter is an insertion between the sixth seal (6:12-17) and the seventh seal (8:1), showing how God cares for His people while He is about to execute His judgment on the earth. ",
  "8862":"The winds here are for God's judgment (Jonah 1:4; Isa. 11:15; Jer. 22:22; 49:36; 51:1). ",
  "8863":"The opening of the seventh seal will bring in the seven trumpets (8:1-2). At the first trumpet, the third part of the earth and the third part of the trees will be burned up (8:7). At the second trumpet, the third part of the sea will be destroyed (8:8-9). Before all this takes place, God will seal all the Israelites whom He intends to preserve (v. 3). ",
  "8864":"This Angel, as well as the One in 8:3, 10:1, and 18:1, is Christ. In the Old Testament, Christ was called \"the Angel of Jehovah\"; that Angel was God Himself (Gen. 22:11-12; Exo. 3:2-6; Judg. 6:11-24; Zech. 1:11-12; 2:8-11; 3:1-7). Here in the New Testament He is again referred to as an Angel (a messenger). The expression another Angel indicates that Christ is not a common angel but a special Angel sent by God. ",
  "8865":"These are the Israelites who will keep the commandments of God during the great tribulation (12:17; 14:12). ",
  "8866":"Reuben was the firstborn of Israel, but because of his sinfulness he lost his birthright, and Judah prevailed above his brothers (1 Chron. 5:1-2). Hence, here the tribe of Judah is mentioned first. ",
  "8867":"Because Joseph (v. 8) and Manasseh, one of Joseph's two sons (Gen. 48:5), represent two different tribes, Joseph will still have the double portion of the birthright (1 Chron. 5:1-2) during the millennium (Ezek. 48:4-5). <br><br>   In the account here, as in 1 Chron. 2--9, the tribe of Dan was omitted because of its idolatry (Judg. 18:30-31; 1 Kings 12:29-30; 2 Kings 10:29; cf. Gen. 49:17). However, Dan will still be counted during the millennium (Ezek. 48:1) because Jacob's blessing was upon him, so that through the Lord's salvation Dan will still be included as one of the tribes (Gen. 49:16-18). ",
  "8868":"The great multitude consists of the redeemed ones from the nations, throughout all generations. These constitute the church (5:9; Rom. 11:25; Acts 15:14, 19). ",
  "8869":"Standing before the throne indicates that the great multitude of the redeemed must have been raptured to the heavens, to the presence of God. Standing ...before the Lamb corresponds with stand before the Son of Man (Luke 21:36), which clearly indicates the rapture. That this is mentioned immediately after the opening of the sixth seal implies that the rapture of the believers must begin before the sixth seal. The record in vv. 9-17 describes in a general way the scene from the time of the rapture of the believers to their enjoyment in eternity. ",
  "8870":"Robes (plural) signify the righteousness of the believers' conduct. White indicates that the conduct of the believers is pure and has been approved by God through having been washed in the blood of the Lamb (v. 14). ",
  "8871":"Palm branches signify the victory of the saints over tribulation, which they have undergone for the Lord's sake (v. 14; cf. John 12:13). Palm trees are also a sign of satisfaction gained through being watered (Exo. 15:27). Palm branches were used for the Feast of Tabernacles, in which the people of God rejoiced because of the satisfaction of their enjoyment (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15). The Feast of Tabernacles was a type that will be fulfilled by this great multitude of God's redeemed enjoying the eternal Feast of Tabernacles. In the temple of God this multitude will flourish like the palm tree (Psa. 92:12-13). ",
  "8872":"The loud praise in which only salvation is mentioned indicates that the praisers are the saved ones. The great multitude, those who are saved, are grateful for God's salvation. ",
  "8873":"This is similar to the word in Luke 15:7, which says that there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents. Here the angels say Amen to the redeemed ones' praise of salvation. ",
  "8874":"The great tribulation here is different from the great tribulation mentioned in Matt. 24:21. The great tribulation here refers to the tribulations, sufferings, persecutions, and afflictions experienced by God's redeemed people throughout the ages. ",
  "8875":"What is depicted in vv. 15-17, similar to what is depicted in 21:3-4 and 22:3-5, is a portrait of eternity. ",
  "8876":"This great multitude of redeemed ones has come out of the great tribulation into a heavenly state, into the temple of God, where they serve Him day and night. Their service to God is the issue of God's salvation. ",
  "8877":"Christ is the tabernacle of God (John 1:14), and the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate enlargement of Christ, will be God's eternal tabernacle (21:2-3), in which all God's redeemed ones will dwell with Him forever. God will overshadow them with Himself as the One who is embodied in Christ. Christ, as the embodiment of God, will be their tabernacle. The record in vv. 15-17 very much resembles that in 21:3-7. ",
  "8878":"Lit., fall. ",
  "8879":"Shepherding includes feed-ing. Under the shepherding of Christ, \"I shall not want\" (Psa. 23:1). ",
  "8880":"The tear in the eyes of the saved ones is a sign of their dissatisfaction. The waters of life are for their satisfaction. Because the Lamb will supply them with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction. The waters of life will be supplied, and the water of tears will be wiped away. ",
  "8881":"Silence in heaven indicates solemnity. At the opening of the seventh seal, all heaven becomes silent be-cause the age is about to be changed from the age of God's toleration to the age of God's wrath. ",
  "8882":"The seventh seal brings in the seven trumpets, which are the contents of the seventh seal. The seven seals are opened secretly, whereas the seven trumpets are sounded openly. ",
  "8883":"See note 2 in ch. 7. ",
  "8884":"The altar of burnt offering (cf. Exo. 27:1-8). ",
  "8885":"The golden censer signifies the prayers of the saints (5:8), which are brought to God by Christ as \"another Angel.\" ",
  "8886":"Incense signifies Christ with all His merit to be added to the prayers of the saints that the saints' prayers offered upon the golden altar might be acceptable to God. ",
  "8887":"Lit., give. ",
  "8888":"At the opening of the seventh seal, there still will be saints praying on the earth. ",
  "8889":"The golden altar is the incense altar (cf. Exo. 30:1-9). ",
  "8890":"The smoke of the incense indicates that the incense is burned and ascends to God with the prayers of the saints. This implies that the prayers of the saints become effective and are acceptable to God. ",
  "8891":"Lit., incenses. ",
  "8892":"The implication here is that this is the answer to the prayers of the saints, especially the prayer in the fifth seal, mentioned in 6:9-11, and the prayer mentioned in Luke 18:7-8. The prayer of the saints in this chapter must be for the judgment of the earth, which opposes God's economy. The answer to the saints' prayers is the executing of God's judgment upon the earth through the succeeding seven trumpets. ",
  "8893":"To cast fire to the earth is to execute God's judgment upon the earth. Therefore, the thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake came as signs of God's judgment. ",
  "8894":"The seven trumpets were given to the seven angels (v. 2). But it is after the prayers of the saints (vv. 3-5) are answered that the seven angels are prepared to trumpet. For God's will in heaven to be carried out on earth, the saints' prayer is required. ",
  "8895":"The third part of the earth refers probably to certain regions of the earth that are most evil and sinful. ",
  "8896":"Referring probably to the sea that adjoins the regions that commit evil against God. This part of the sea also will be damaged by God's judgment. ",
  "8897":"Lit., souls. ",
  "8898":"A bitter plant. ",
  "8899":"Today those who oppose God and those who practice evil against Him still enjoy God's creation. Because of man's evil opposition against God, the water of God's creation, which is crucial to human life, will probably be damaged in a limited way by God's judgment. ",
  "8900":"The first four trumpets, which are not yet the direct judgment on men, form one group, like the first four seals. The first trumpet is a judgment on the earth, including the trees and all the grass, as occurred in Egypt (Exo. 9:18-25); the second, a judgment on the sea, including the living creatures and ships; the third, a judgment on the rivers and springs of waters, as occurred in Egypt (Exo. 7:17-21); the fourth, a judgment on the sun, the moon, and the stars that they may be darkened, as also occurred in Egypt (Exo. 10:21-23). By the judgments of these four trumpets, the third part of the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the hosts in the heavens are damaged and are thus caused to be no longer good for man's living. At the sixth seal, before the seven trumpets, there was already a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of the heavens (6:12-14). The extent of the damage caused by that judgment was not as definite as the extent of the damage caused by the first four trumpets. At the seventh trumpet, through the seven bowls there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun (16:1-21). Those will be God's most severe judgments on the earth and heaven. ",
  "8901":"Referring probably to that part of the sun that shines upon the evil regions of the earth (cf. Matt. 5:45). God knows which part this is, and it will be damaged by God's judgment. ",
  "8902":"The last three trumpets will be the last three woes (9:12; 11:14) of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which will occur in the last half of the seventieth week (Dan. 9:27), a period of three and a half years (Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 12:14), that is, forty-two months (11:2; 13:5), or twelve hundred and sixty days (11:3; 12:6). ",
  "8903":"The star here refers to Satan, who will be cast down from heaven to earth. The angels are likened to stars (Job 38:7; Rev. 12:4). Satan, as the archangel, was the daystar (Isa. 14:12, lit.). In Luke 10:18 the judgment upon him was mentioned. Here, and in 12:9-10, is the execution of that judgment. ",
  "8904":"The abyss is the dwelling place of the demons (Luke 8:31). ",
  "8905":"The locusts here are not like the locusts in Exo. 10:12-15, in that these have tails like scorpions, and stings, and they harm men (v. 10). They must be demon possessed, because they come out of the smoke that issues from the pit of the abyss, the dwelling place of the demons (v. 2). ",
  "8906":"Lit., authority. So in vv. 10, 19. ",
  "8907":"The plagues of the first four trumpets are not directly upon man, whereas the woes of the last three trumpets are. Only the Israelites who have the seal of God on their foreheads will not be harmed by the demon possessed locusts (7:3-8). ",
  "8908":"Lit., the likenesses of the locusts were like. ",
  "8909":"Verses 7 and 9 are very similar to Joel 2:4-5, 25, and 1:6, which are words spoken concerning Israel. This, along with the fact that the Israelites need to be sealed by God (7:3-8) to escape the harm of the locusts, may indicate that the woe of the fifth trumpet will come especially upon the Israelites. ",
  "8910":"The angel of the abyss is the beast, Antichrist, who will come out of the pit of the abyss (11:7; 17:8). ",
  "8911":"The Hebrew word means destruction; it is used also in Job 26:6; 28:22; Prov. 15:11. ",
  "8912":"The Greek word means destroyer. As the destroyer, Antichrist will do much destroying (Dan. 8:23-25). ",
  "8913":"In the first woe, the woe of the fifth trumpet, Satan falls from heaven to earth and Antichrist comes up from the abyss, and the two work together to torment man. Since it is at the fifth trumpet that Satan falls from heaven to damage the earth and persecute the people of God for three and a half years (12:10, 12-17, 6); and since it is at the same time (the last three and a half years) that Antichrist comes up out of the abyss to collaborate with Satan to torment people, persecute the saints, and blaspheme God (13:5-7; 11:7); and since it is in the same three and a half years that the holy city, Jerusalem, is given over to the Gentiles for destruction (11:2), the woe of the fifth trumpet must be the beginning of the most severe woes of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21; see note 2 in ch. 11). The second woe, the woe of the sixth trumpet, and the third woe, the woe of the seventh trumpet (8:13; 9:12; 11:14), must also be two parts of the most severe woes of the great tribulation. These three woes, with the damage from the sixth seal and the first four trumpets, will be a trial upon all those who dwell on the earth (3:10). ",
  "8914":"The two woes are the sixth trumpet itself and the woe of the seventh trumpet (vv. 13-21; 11:14-15), that is, the seven bowls (ch. 16). ",
  "8915":"The blood of propitiation was put on the four horns of the golden altar, the incense altar, for propitiation (Lev. 16:18), i.e., for redemption. The voice that comes out of the four horns of the golden altar indicates that God's judgment on man is based on the redemption of Christ; i.e., it comes because men do not believe in Christ's redemption. ",
  "8916":"For the hour and day and month and year indicates that the four angels had been prepared unto the hour, plus the day, plus the month, and plus the year &#151; altogether thirteen months, one day, and one hour &#151; for the killing of men. The killing will last first one hour, then one day, then one month, and finally one year. ",
  "8917":"The two hundred million horsemen from the rising of the sun will join the war at Armageddon (16:12-16; 19:17-21). ",
  "8918":"The horses' tails here, which are like serpents, are more poisonous than the locusts' tails, which are like scorpions (v. 10). The locusts only torment men for five months (vv. 5, 10), whereas the horses kill the third part of men (vv. 15, 18). This means that the woe of the sixth trumpet is more severe than that of the fifth. ",
  "8919":"The goal of God's judgment is that men would repent. ",
  "8920":"In contrast to Psa. 115:5; 135:16, this verse does not say that the idols cannot speak, because the image of Antichrist does speak (13:15). ",
  "8921":"The section from 10:1--11:13 is an insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets. ",
  "8922":"\"Another strong Angel\" here, as well as the One in 7:2, 8:3, and 18:1, is Christ. At this point He is coming down out of heaven. This vision, part of the insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets, is a hint that before the seventh trumpet, Christ is on the way to earth. At this time He is clothed with a cloud and is not yet on the cloud, in contrast to 14:14 and Matt. 24:30; 26:64. To be on the cloud is to come openly, whereas to be clothed with a cloud is to come secretly. This indicates that even after the sixth trumpet, Christ still is coming secretly, not openly. He will come secretly until He is seen by all the tribes of the earth, as mentioned in 1:7 and Matt. 24:30, at which time He will come openly. ",
  "8923":"The rainbow here indicates that Christ in His judgment upon the earth will keep the covenant that God made with Noah concerning the earth (Gen. 9:8-17). It indicates also that Christ will execute judgment according to the God who sits on the throne with the rainbow around it (4:2-3), the faithful and covenant-keeping God. ",
  "8924":"Near the time of His coming to the people on the earth openly, Christ will be like the sun, not like the morning star, which appears before the darkest time, prior to dawn, to those who love Him and wait for Him (see 2:28 and note 1; 2 Pet. 1:19 and note 4). ",
  "8925":"Pillars here indicate steadfastness (Jer. 1:18; Gal. 2:9). ",
  "8926":"Fire here signifies the holiness of God (Exo. 19:18; Heb. 12:29), according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth. ",
  "8927":"This little opened scroll is the scroll in 5:1, which only Christ is worthy to open and which He took out of the hand of God (5:5, 7). Now it is in His hand. In 5:1 it was sealed; here it is open. Being only a part of the scroll, it is called here \"a little ... scroll.\" The main part of the scroll has already been revealed. ",
  "8928":"Christ's placing His feet on the sea and on the land is His treading on them, and to tread on them is to take possession of them (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3; Psa. 8:6-8). This indicates that Christ is coming down to take possession of the earth. Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God's economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth. ",
  "8929":"A lion's roaring is likened to a king's wrath (Prov. 19:12; 20:2). This indicates that Christ, as the King of the earth, is provoked to wrath. ",
  "8930":"The seven thunders must be the ultimate utterances of God's full wrath. ",
  "8931":"To swear is the practice of the Old Testament, not of the New (Matt. 5:34-36). ",
  "8932":"The main item of the things in heaven is the angels. ",
  "8933":"The main item of the things in the earth is men. ",
  "8934":"The main item of the things in the sea is the demons. ",
  "8935":"Lit., space of time. After the sixth trumpet, there will be no more time of toleration in God's judgment upon the earth. Hence, the seventh trumpet is the most serious of God's judgments. It is God's answer in full to the martyred saints' prayer in 6:10. ",
  "8936":"The trumpeting voice of the seventh trumpet will last a period of days. ",
  "8937":"In the dispensations from Adam to Moses and from Moses to Christ, everything was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery. It will be the same in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth &#151; everything will be unveiled and there will be no more mystery. But in the dispensation from Christ to the millennial kingdom, everything is a mystery. The incarnation of Christ, as the beginning of this dispensation of mystery, is a mystery (1 Tim. 3:16). Christ Himself (Col. 2:2), the church (Eph. 3:4-6), the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13:11), the gospel (Eph. 6:19), the indwelling of Christ (Col. 1:26-27), and the coming resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the end of this dispensation of mystery (1 Cor. 15:51-52) are all mysteries that were hidden in the times of the ages (Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:5; Col. 1:26). All these mysteries will be completed, finished, and will be over at the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet. ",
  "8938":"At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, not only God's judgment of wrath upon the earth but also the mystery of God are finished. ",
  "8939":"Or, completed. ",
  "8940":"In the seventh trumpet the good news that God announced to His own slaves the prophets, as in Isa. 2:2-4; 11:1-10; 65:17-20; 66:22, will be fulfilled; that is, the kingdom in its manifestation will come (11:15), and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem will follow (21:1-3). ",
  "8941":"The writer of this book not only received but also devoured the scroll. To devour anything is to receive it into one's being. We must receive the divine revelation, especially the book of Revelation, in this way. Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel did this (Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 2:8; 3:1-3). ",
  "8942":"When we receive the divine revelation by devouring it, it is sweet as we eat it, but it becomes bitter as we digest it, that is, as we experience it. ",
  "8943":"Referring to the angels. ",
  "8944":"The prophecy of this book is composed of two sections. From the first seal to the sixth trumpet (chs. 6--10) is the first section; it is in secret. From the seventh trumpet to the new heaven and new earth (chs. 11--22) is the second section; it is openly manifested. John prophesied in the first section. He must prophesy again, that is, prophesy in the second section of the prophecy of this book, the section that concerns Christ's coming to possess the earth as His kingdom (11:15). This is the content of the little scroll, the last part of God's economy. ",
  "8945":"A reed, as in 21:15 and Ezek. 40:3; 42:16-19, is for measuring, which is for taking possession, whereas a rod implies punishment (Prov. 10:13; Isa. 10:5; 11:4). Hence, a reed like a rod indicates measuring with punishment in order to possess. ",
  "8946":"I.e., sanctify, preserve, and possess (Num. 35:2, 5; Ezek. 45:1-3; 42:15, 20; 48:8, 12, 15). The measuring of the temple of God and the incense altar in the heavens indicates that during the great tribulation the heavens will be preserved from being damaged, because in that three and a half years Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth. ",
  "8947":"The Greek word refers to the inner temple. ",
  "8948":"The altar here is the golden altar of incense, because it is with the temple; it is not the bronze altar of sacrifice in the court that is outside the temple (v. 2). ",
  "8949":"The court is on earth. The earthly temple and Jerusalem on earth will be given over to be trampled by Antichrist and the Gentiles. ",
  "8950":"See note 1. ",
  "8951":"The holy city here is the earthly Jerusalem (Isa. 52:1; Matt. 27:53). ",
  "8952":"At the end of this age Antichrist will make a firm covenant with the Jews for one week (seven years), which will be the last week of the seventy weeks that God appointed for the Jewish nation in Dan. 9:24-27. In the middle of the last week (that is, after the first half of the seven years) Antichrist will break the covenant and destroy the worship of God (Dan. 9:27). Then he will blaspheme God and persecute His people for three and a half years (13:5-7; Dan. 7:25; 12:7), which is the forty-two months mentioned here and the last half of the last week in Dan. 9:27, during which Antichrist will also destroy the holy city, Jerusalem. According to Matt. 24:15 and 21, these last three and a half years must be the time of the great tribulation, which comes as a trial on the inhabitants of the earth (3:10). ",
  "8953":"Lit., give. ",
  "8954":"Two witnesses give an adequate testimony (Deut. 17:6; 19:15; Matt. 18:16). The two witnesses here are Moses and Elijah. What they do in vv. 5-6 is the same as what Moses and Elijah did (Exo 7:17, 19; 9:14; 11:1; 2 Kings 1:10-12; 1 Kings 17:1). Moses and Elijah appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-3). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (Luke 16:16), both testified for God. Elijah's mission was predicted (Mal. 4:5; Matt. 17:11). They are the two olive trees, the two sons of oil, in Zech. 4:3, 11-14 (see note 9 in Matt. 25). ",
  "8955":"This is the forty-two months mentioned in v. 2, the period of time during which Antichrist will blaspheme God (13:5-6) and persecute His people (12:6, 14). Under Antichrist's evil power and persecution, the two witnesses will prophesy, speak for God, and testify against the evildoings of Antichrist. ",
  "8956":"Sackcloth is a symbol of mourning (2 Sam. 3:31). The two witnesses will wear funeral clothes as a warning to the inhabitants of the earth, telling them to stay away from the worship of Antichrist that they may escape God's judgment. ",
  "8957":"The olive trees produce oil for the lamps. Oil signifies the Holy Spirit. In Zech. 4:14 the two witnesses here are called \"the two sons of oil\" (lit.), indicating that they are full of the Holy Spirit. ",
  "8958":"The lampstands give light by means of the oil of the olive trees. In the church age, the churches are the lampstands for God's testimony (1:20), whereas in the last three and a half years of this age, the two witnesses will be the lampstands for God's testimony. ",
  "8959":"During the great tribulation the two witnesses will give an adequate testimony for God (v. 4) and against Antichrist. ",
  "8960":"The beast here is Antichrist, who will come up out of the abyss (17:8) and out of the sea (13:1) and who will make war with the two witnesses and with the saints (13:7). ",
  "8961":"The great city is the holy city mentioned in v. 2, the earthly Jerusalem. ",
  "8962":"After the restoration of the nation of Israel in 1948, the Jews who returned to their fathers' land were still in unbelief. They will be as sinful as Sodom (cf. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:9; Jer. 23:14) and as worldly as Egypt (cf. Ezek. 23:3, 8, 19, 27) until the return of Christ, their Messiah, at which time all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:26). ",
  "8963":"The three and a half days must be included in the one thousand two hundred and sixty days in which they prophesy and bear testimony for the Lord; otherwise, those days would extend beyond the great tribulation. ",
  "8964":"Or, Spirit of life. ",
  "8965":"That they stood on their feet indicates that they had been resurrected. Their resurrection is separate from the one predicted in 1 Thes. 4:16. ",
  "8966":"Indicating that they are raptured. Their being killed, resurrected, and raptured are a part of their testimony and must all be within the one thousand two hundred and sixty days of their ministry. Thus, their rapture must take place on the last day of their ministry, which is also the last day of the great tribulation. It will be on the same day as the rapture predicted in 1 Thes. 4:17, and it may even be at the same time, or it may be later. ",
  "8967":"The city here is the great city in v. 8, Jerusalem. A tenth part of the city of Jerusalem fell because of the earthquake mentioned in this verse. In the last earthquake the city will be divided into three parts, as mentioned in 16:19. ",
  "8968":"Lit., names of men; implying people of renown. ",
  "8969":"The third woe is a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet (see note 15) which consists of the seven bowls of God's wrath (ch. 16). Since the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet is recorded after the vision concerning the destruction of Jerusalem during the last three and a half years (v. 2), and since the seven bowls are the last plagues at the consummation of God's wrath (15:1; 16:1), the woe of the seventh trumpet must mark the end of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). See note 12 in ch. 9 and note 2 in this chapter. ",
  "8970":"The seventh trumpet, the last one (1 Cor. 15:52), has two aspects, the negative and the positive. <br><br>   The negative aspect includes (1) the last plagues, the plagues of the seven bowls, in which the wrath of God is finished (15:1; 16:1-21), as the last woe to those who dwell on the earth (8:13; 9:12; 11:14) &#151; v. 18; and (2) the destruction of the destroyers of the earth immediately upon the Lord's coming back to the earth (17:14; 18:1-2; 19:19--20:3) &#151; v. 18. <br><br>   The positive aspect includes (1) the coming of the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom in its manifestation &#151; vv. 15, 17; (2) the judgment of the dead (see note 18) before the resurrection of the saints &#151; v. 18; and (3) the giving of the reward, at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), to the prophets and the saints after the resurrection and rapture of the saints (1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17), and the giving of the reward, at the throne of God's glory (Matt. 25:31-34), to those who fear God's name (14:6-7) &#151; v. 18. <br><br>   Hence, the seventh trumpet comprises all the things from the end of the great tribulation to eternity future, such as the last plagues, i.e., the seven bowls (ch. 16); the resurrection and rapture of the saints (including the two witnesses); the rewarding of the saints; the marriage of the Lamb (19:7-9); the coming back of Christ to the earth; the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, their followers, the material Babylon the Great, and Satan (18:1--19:4; 19:11--20:3); the reigning in the millennial kingdom (20:4-6); the final judgment upon the earth and Satan (20:7-10); the final judgment of the dead (20:11-15); and the ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity (21:1--22:5). ",
  "8971":"At the sounding of the seventh trumpet, not only will the great tribulation end, but also this age will close, the mystery of God will be finished (10:7), and another age, the age of the kingdom, the millennium, will begin. ",
  "8972":"The kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back after He executes His judgment upon the nations (Dan. 7:13-14; 2:44-45). ",
  "8973":"Here the Lord's reigning forever and ever is the Lord's reigning in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:5). This indicates that the seventh trumpet includes the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. ",
  "8974":"The wrath here refers to the wrath contained in the seven bowls in ch. 16, which are a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet. ",
  "8975":"Since for the dead to be judged is mentioned before to give the reward to Your slaves ..., the former must not refer to the judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). Rather, it refers to the fact that at the close of this age, before the millennium, according to John 5:27-29, the dead will be judged concerning who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium (1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 20:4-6) and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-12). ",
  "8976":"The reward will be given by the Lord to His faithful ones at His coming back (22:12; Matt. 16:27). After the resurrection and rapture of the saints (1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17), Christ at His judgment seat will judge the prophets and the saints (2 Cor. 5:10) to determine who among the saved persons is worthy of a reward and who needs further discipline. ",
  "8977":"Those who fear God's name are the \"sheep\" mentioned in Matt. 25:33-40. They are those who will heed the eternal gospel, fearing God and worshipping Him and not worshipping Antichrist and his image (14:6-7). During the great tribulation they will care for the Lord's needy people, His little brothers (the believers who suffer persecution and the Jews who fear God). Hence, they will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to become there the nations on the earth (2:26; 12:5). ",
  "8978":"Those who destroy the earth are Babylon the Great (18:2-3), Antichrist (13:3), the false prophet (13:14), and Satan (20:7-10), and the people who follow them (17:12-14; 19:19; 20:8-9). All of them will be destroyed in the seventh trumpet. ",
  "8979":"The Greek word refers to the inner temple. This verse is continued by 15:5. On the negative side, the throne with the rainbow (4:2-3) is the center of all the judgments executed over the earth in chs. 6--11, whereas, on the positive side, the temple with the ark is the center of all God's accomplishments in the universe carried out in chs. 12--22. ",
  "8980":"Four earthquakes are predicted in this book. The first, in 6:12, occurs at the time of the sixth seal; the second, in 8:5, before the seven trumpets; the third, in 11:13, at the time of the rapture of the two witnesses, which should be on the day of the beginning of the seventh trumpet, before the pouring out of the seven bowls; and the fourth, in this verse, still at the time of the seventh trumpet, that is, in 16:17-20, at the time of the seventh bowl, which constitutes the most severe calamity of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet. ",
  "8981":"The first section of this book, composed of the first eleven chapters, covers all things that occur from Christ's ascension to eternity. The second section, composed of the last eleven chapters, gives details of the important things and crucial matters occurring from the last three and a half years of the present age, which will be the period of the great tribulation, to the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. The first of the important things and crucial matters revealed in this section is a woman who brought forth a man-child. <br><br>   This woman is \"clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.\" In Gen. 37:9, Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers. There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, plus Joseph himself, signified the totality of God's people on the earth. Based on the principle of that dream, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars here must signify the totality of God's people on earth, which is symbolized here by a woman. Most of her being is clothed with the sun. The sun signifies God's people in the New Testament age. Before Christ came to the world, it was the dark night of the Old Testament age. When Christ as the rising sun came from on high (Luke 1:78), the age of the sun came. Before that, it was the age of the moon, which signifies God's people in the Old Testament time. The moon is underneath the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars are. The stars, which signify the patriarchs, God's people before the law was given, are on her head as a crown. All God's people in these three ages, who together constitute this woman, are light bearers. Hence, she is the bright woman shining throughout all generations. ",
  "8982":"The child here, being a man-child (v. 5), signifies the stronger part of God's people. Throughout all generations there are some stronger ones among God's people. These are considered in the Bible a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God's kingdom down to earth. ",
  "8983":"To cry out here is to pray. ",
  "8984":"Travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth signifies that throughout all generations God's people have been suffering the travail of delivery (Isa. 26:17-18; Jer. 6:24; 13:21; 30:6; Micah 4:9-10; 5:3; Gal. 4:19) to bring forth the man-child that he may fight for God's kingdom. ",
  "8985":"The dragon signifies Satan (v. 9). In Gen. 3 Satan was a serpent, a smaller creature, a subtle one. Here he has become a dragon, much larger than a serpent and cruel. Hence, he is called \"a great red dragon.\" Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan's murders (John 8:44). ",
  "8986":"The seven heads and ten horns are those of the beast, Antichrist (13:1). This indicates that the dragon and the beast are one and shows that Antichrist is the embodiment of Satan. ",
  "8987":"The seven diadems indicate the glory of the seven Caesars' extraordinary kingship. Since each of these seven Caesars was one with Satan, each assumed deity, claimed to be God, and forced the people to worship him as God. ",
  "8988":"The stars of heaven here signify the angels (Job 38:7; Isa. 14:12). The third part of the stars of heaven must be the fallen angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. Satan drags all of them away, and as the angels of Satan they will be cast to the earth with Satan (v. 9). Hence, at that time the earth will be filled with these fallen angels, who will damage the dwelling place of the people who rebel against God. The earth will thus become a dreadful place. ",
  "8989":"That the dragon stood before the woman signifies that Satan is always against the people of God, opposing them. From the time of Gen. 3:15 to this day, Satan, the ancient serpent, has been fighting continually against the woman with the intention of devouring her child. ",
  "8990":"Brought forth here signifies resurrection, as in Acts 13:33-34. The man-child is composed of the overcoming saints who have died and been resurrected. This is proved by the words unto death in v. 11. ",
  "8991":"In the Bible, woman signifies the weaker one and man the stronger one (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child here signifies the stronger part of God's people. That the man-child is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in 2:26-27. ",
  "8992":"See note 17 in 1 Thes. 4. To be caught up is to be raptured. The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers, which is mentioned in 1 Thes. 4:17. There, the majority of the believers are raptured (1) to the air, and (2) at the last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16), which is the seventh trumpet (11:15). But here, the man-child is raptured (1) to the throne of God, and (2) before the one thousand two hundred and sixty days, which is the time of the great tribulation of three and a half years (forty-two months, v. 14; 13:5; 11:2), beginning from the sixth seal, before the fifth trumpet (9:1). ",
  "8993":"After the rapture of the man-child, the woman is left on earth to suffer persecution (v. 13). During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place where she can be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days before He brings His people into the millennial kingdom. (This is similar to the time when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel and God brought His people to the wilderness, where He nourished them before bringing them into the good land.) That the woman (the remaining and living majority of the believers) will be preserved and nourished by God for a thousand two hundred and sixty days during the great tribulation is a strong proof that their rapture will take place on the last day of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, that is, the last day of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days. ",
  "8994":"Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, Michael and his angels begin to war against Satan. This indicates that the man-child, the stronger part of God's people, is always engaged in fighting God's enemy, Satan. They have been fighting Satan continually on earth. Heaven is waiting for them to arrive that a war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven. ",
  "8995":"The Bible reveals the names of two angels &#151; Michael and Gabriel. Gabriel is a reporter bringing news to God's people (Dan. 8:16; 9:21-22; Luke 1:19, 26), whereas Michael is a fighter contending for God's people (Dan. 10:13, 21; 11:1; 12:1; Jude 9). ",
  "8996":"These angels must be the fallen angels, who follow Satan to rebel against God (Matt. 25:41). See note 4. ",
  "8997":"Satan, the enemy of God, was judged by the Lord Jesus on the cross (John 12:31; 16:11). After that, the overcoming believers are needed for the carrying out of that judgment, for the executing of that sentence. The war waged by the overcoming believers against Satan is actually the executing of the Lord's judgment upon him. Eventually, through their fighting, he is cast out of heaven. See note 1 in ch. 9. ",
  "8998":"By the time of Rev. 12, Satan has become old; hence, he becomes the ancient serpent. ",
  "8999":"See note 10 in ch. 2. ",
  "9000":"The word Satan means adversary. Satan is not only God's enemy outside God's kingdom but also God's adversary from within God's kingdom, rebelling against God. ",
  "9001":"The overcoming believers fight against Satan to usher in God's kingdom. The Lord taught us to pray for the coming of the kingdom (Matt. 6:10). Along with our praying for the kingdom's coming, we need to fight for it. The coming of the kingdom has two aspects: the reality of the kingdom (Matt. 5:3), which is in the proper church life today (Rom. 14:17), and the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium, which will be brought in through the overcoming believers. <br><br>   When the manifestation of the kingdom comes, the salvation of God will come in full with the kingdom. God's salvation has already been manifested to us today, but it will come in full in the kingdom age. It is the same with the power of God and the authority of His Christ. We have participated in God's power and Christ's authority today, but our full enjoyment of them will be in the kingdom age. ",
  "9002":"The accuser is the devil, who accused Job (Job 1:9; 2:4-5) and Joshua (Zech. 3:1-2) and who is now accusing the believers before God, even day and night. ",
  "9003":"Referring to the overcoming believers who constitute the man-child in v. 5. These have been opposed and slandered by God's enemy, Satan, whom they overcame. ",
  "9004":"The blood of the Lamb, which is for our redemption, answers before God all the accusations of the devil against us and gives us the victory over him. We need to apply this blood whenever we sense the accusation of the devil. ",
  "9005":"The word of their testimony is their word that testifies that the devil has been judged by the Lord. Whenever we sense the devil's accusation, we should verbally testify how the Lord has already dealt with him. We must declare with the uttered word the Lord's victory over him. ",
  "9006":"Because of Adam's fall, Satan joined himself to man's soul-life &#151; man's self (Matt. 16:23-24). Hence, to overcome Satan we must not love our soul-life; rather, we must hate it and deny it (Luke 14:26; 9:23). ",
  "9007":"Unto death indicates martyrdom. The overcoming believers who constitute the man-child do not love their soul-life even unto death. ",
  "9008":"Lit., tabernacle. ",
  "9009":"The dragon is angry because he has been cast down and limited to the earth, thereby losing his territory in the heavens and in the air. ",
  "9010":"The short time here will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation (v. 14; 13:5; 11:2). ",
  "9011":"Satan, the angry dragon, will concentrate his hatred upon God's people. ",
  "9012":"The great eagle signifies God, and the two wings signify His strength to rescue (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12). As He brought the children of Israel out from Pharaoh's persecution, so He will bring His people away from Satan's persecution in the great tribulation. ",
  "9013":"A time and times and half a time denotes three and a half years, that is, one thousand two hundred and sixty days. ",
  "9014":"Water here signifies the armies (see marginal references) that will be sent by Satan to destroy the people of God. ",
  "9015":"The earth will open, just as in Num. 16:31-33, and swallow the armies sent by Satan. ",
  "9016":"The rest of her seed signifies the people of God other than the man-child; those people constitute the weaker part of the woman. Among them, some are the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and some are the believers, who have the testimony of Jesus. Both will pass through the great tribulation and suffer the dragon's persecution and attack. ",
  "9017":"He denotes the dragon. ",
  "9018":"The sea here is the same as that in 13:1, the Mediterranean Sea. The sand of the sea here should be the seashore of the Holy Land, where the nation of Israel is. That the dragon will stand on the sand of the sea and that the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled for forty-two months (11:2) indicate that Satan's persecution during the great tribulation will be carried out mainly in the land of Israel. ",
  "9019":"This beast, the fourth beast mentioned in Dan. 7:7, is Antichrist. In 9:11 he is the king of the locusts. ",
  "9020":"The sea here is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. In 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8 we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. Here we are told that he will come up out of the sea, as is mentioned also in Dan. 7:3. This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which exists in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. (See notes 8 10 and 11 in ch. 17.) His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. In biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (17:15; Isa. 57:20). <br><br>   That Antichrist will come up out of both the abyss and the sea may indicate also that the sea is the mouth of the abyss, because the abyss is in the heart of the earth (Rom. 10:7; Matt. 12:40) and the sea is above the earth. ",
  "9021":"The ten horns and seven heads of the beast are those of the dragon (12:3). This indicates that the beast is one with the dragon. The ten horns are the ten coming kings (17:12; Dan. 7:24); the seven heads are the seven Caesars (17:10). The ten horns correspond with the ten toes of the great image mentioned in Dan. 2:42-44. The word here indicates that the Roman Empire, Antichrist, and the ten kings are one with Satan. ",
  "9022":"The seven Caesars symbolized by the seven heads of the beast claimed deity and called for their people to worship them as gods. That was truly a blasphemy against God. ",
  "9023":"The beast, Antichrist, is \"like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.\" According to Dan. 7:4-6, the leopard, which is characterized by swift and cruel movement, was the symbol of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece. The bear, characterized by its destroying feet, was the symbol of the monarchy of Medo-Persia. The lion, characterized by its devouring mouth, was a symbol of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in Dan. 7:4-7. He is the totality of all the evil powers in human history. ",
  "9024":"That the dragon gives his power, his throne, and great authority to the beast indicates that he makes the beast one with him so that on behalf of the dragon the beast can resist God and persecute God's people on the earth. ",
  "9025":"One of his heads refers to one of the Caesars, who will be slain and resuscitated. His death stroke was healed means that the Caesar will be resuscitated from death. (See note 11 in ch. 17.) Because of this the whole earth will marvel and follow after him. ",
  "9026":"The forty-two months here and in 11:2 are the three and a half years in 12:14, and are also the one thousand two hundred and sixty days in 11:3 and 12:6, the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). At the end of this age Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant with the nation of Israel. Three and a half years after the covenant is made, he will break it, terminate all the Jewish worship and service to God (Dan. 9:27), persecute the saints (v. 7), and destroy the holy city (11:2) for three and a half years. ",
  "9027":"The saints here constitute the rest of the woman's seed mentioned in 12:17, which consists of the Jews, who keep God's commandments, and the believers, who bear the testimony for Christ. This proves that in the great tribulation there will still be believers on the earth who are not yet raptured. ",
  "9028":"Or, written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. ",
  "9029":"Lit., scroll. ",
  "9030":"See note 7. ",
  "9031":"This other beast is the false prophet (16:13; 19:20; 20:10). ",
  "9032":"This other beast will come up out of the earth. Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, as mentioned in note 1 this other beast, the false prophet, will come out of the Jews. This one may be Judas Iscariot (John 6:70-71), because after Judas died, he went to \"his own place\" (Acts 1:25), not to his people as others did (Gen. 25:17; 35:29). Geographically, this false prophet will come up out of the earth, and figuratively, he will come out of the Jews. ",
  "9033":"The false prophet looks like a lamb but speaks like a dragon. That he appears to be a lamb but speaks like the dragon, Satan, indicates his falsity. ",
  "9034":"The false prophet will employ satanic power to perform great signs, such as calling down fire out of heaven as Elijah did (1 Kings 18:36-38); thus, it will be difficult for people to distinguish the real prophets from the false prophet (cf. 11:5). ",
  "9035":"Lit., telling. ",
  "9036":"Or, spirit. ",
  "9037":"No idol made by man has ever been able to speak (Psa. 115:5), but this last idol will be enabled to speak as a living image. This surely will be a marvelous sign to those who dwell on the earth, and will cause them all to worship the idol. ",
  "9038":"Lit., mind. ",
  "9039":"The number of the beast is the number of a man. This man is Caesar Nero, who is the coming Antichrist. (See notes 8 10 and 11 in ch. 17.) The number represented by the Hebrew letters of the name Caesar Nero is 666, as follows: <br><br>   Because the book of Revelation was written during the time of the Roman Empire, John did not mention the name of Nero but indicated it with a number. Therefore, wisdom is needed to understand. ",
  "9040":"Zion here is not the Zion on the earth but the one in the heavens (Heb. 12:22). ",
  "9041":"This must be an actual number with a symbolic meaning. One hundred forty-four thousand is one thousand times twelve times twelve. Twelve is the number of completion in God's eternal administration. One hundred forty-four (21:17) is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way. The number here is one thousand times this ultimate completion. ",
  "9042":"That these early overcomers have the name of the Lamb and the name of the Father written on their foreheads signifies that they are one with the Lamb and with the Father and that they belong to the Lamb and to the Father. They are in contrast to those who worship the beast and have the name of the beast written on their foreheads (13:16-17). ",
  "9043":"Many waters signifies the tumultuousness of the sound. ",
  "9044":"Loud thunder signifies the solemnity of the sound. ",
  "9045":"Harp-singers signifies the pleasantness of the sound. ",
  "9046":"No one can learn the new song sung by these first overcomers, a song that must be in accord with their experiences of the Lamb, because no one else has their specific and particular experiences of Christ. ",
  "9047":"From the earth proves that they are no longer on the earth but have been raptured to the heavens. ",
  "9048":"This should be the virginity mentioned by the Lord in Matt. 19:11-12. However, the same principle could be applied to the sisters (1 Cor. 7:7, 37). ",
  "9049":"These early overcomers will be the first-ripe ones in God's field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. The harvest will be reaped later, in vv. 14-16. This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19). The events recorded in vv. 6-13, all of which will take place during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), indicate clearly and prove strongly that the first overcomers, the firstfruits in vv. 1-5, will be raptured before the great tribulation, and that the harvest in vv. 14-16, composed of the majority of the believers, will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation. See note 6 in ch. 12. ",
  "9050":"The devil is the father of all liars, and lies come out of him (John 8:44). That no lie was found in the mouth of the overcomers indicates that there is nothing of Satan in their expression. ",
  "9051":"Without blemish indicates that they are without spot or wrinkle and are perfect in the holiness of God (Eph. 5:27), absolutely sanctified to God and fully saturated with God (1 Thes. 5:23). ",
  "9052":"The eternal gospel, which will be preached during the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), differs from the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) preached in the church age. The basic contents of the gospel of grace are repentance unto God and faith in the Lord Jesus (Acts 20:21) that men may be forgiven of their sins and be born again as the children of God (Luke 24:47; John 1:12); whereas the basic content of the eternal gospel is that men should fear God and worship God that they may not be deceived and follow Antichrist but may be brought back to the genuine worship of God, who made heaven and earth (v. 7). Only man is privileged to preach the gospel of grace on the earth today (Acts 10:3-6). But the eternal gospel will be preached by the angel in the air at the close of this age. ",
  "9053":"Lit., sitting. ",
  "9054":"\"Fear God and give Him glory\" is a commandment given to those who dwell on the earth. It counters the false prophet's deceit that says that men should follow Antichrist and neutralizes the death threat against those who refuse to worship Antichrist during the great tribulation (13:14-15). ",
  "9055":"The judgment here is the judgment that Christ will execute over all the nations at His coming back to earth, as He predicted in Matt. 25:31-46. This judgment will be executed on the living. It differs from the judgment on the dead, which will take place after the millennium, as mentioned in Rev. 20:11-15. All the people of the nations who remain at the Lord's coming back to earth will be judged according to the eternal gospel preached by the angel during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). If in fearing and worshipping God they have treated well the Christians and Jews, the Lord's brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist's persecution during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they can enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34). If in following Antichrist and worshipping his image they have ill-treated the Christians and Jews, they will be condemned and cast into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). ",
  "9056":"The worship of Him who has made heaven and earth is in contrast to the worship of Antichrist and his image in v. 9. ",
  "9057":"The modifying clause who has made all the nations drink ...indicates that Babylon here is the religious, mysterious Babylon, which is the Roman Catholic Church, as in 17:2-6, not the material Babylon, as in 18:2. Antichrist will destroy all religions when he breaks the covenant with Israel in the middle of the last week (seven years &#151; Dan. 9:27; 11:31). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which will last for three and a half years. Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods and force people to worship him (Dan. 8:9-11; 11:36-37; 2 Thes. 2:3-4; Rev. 13:4-6, 12, 14-15). At that time, he will destroy the religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church (17:16). Hence, the religious Babylon will fall at the beginning of the great tribulation, whereas the material Babylon will fall at the end of the great tribulation (18:2). ",
  "9058":"Wine of ...her fornication refers to the spiritual fornication of the Roman Catholic Church, of which she has made all the nations drink (17:2-6). While she commits her fornication, she is furious with the saints who do not consent to her fornication. This is the fury of her fornication. Hence, the wine of her fornication is also called \"the wine of the fury of her fornication.\" ",
  "9059":"This is the fire and brimstone in the lake of fire (19:20; 20:10, 14). ",
  "9060":"The endurance to suffer Antichrist's persecution will be needed by the saints who remain in the great tribulation. ",
  "9061":"The saints who remain in the great tribulation are of two peoples: the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who keep the faith of Jesus. ",
  "9062":"The dead here are those who are martyred under the persecution of Antichrist during the great tribulation. This is proved by 20:4. ",
  "9063":"This book, written in the time of the degradation of the church, stresses the Spirit. It does not say here \"says the Scripture,\" but \"says the Spirit.\" ",
  "9064":"In 10:1 Christ is still clothed with a cloud, whereas here He is on the cloud. His being on the cloud corresponds with 1 Thes. 4:17 and indicates that at this point the Lord's coming back is made public in the air. ",
  "9065":"At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man. As the Son of Man, He is qualified to execute God's judgment on everyone (John 5:27). ",
  "9066":"The golden crown on the Lord's head indicates that the Lord is the One crowned with glory (Heb. 2:9). ",
  "9067":"The sharp sickle in the Lord's hand indicates that the Lord is the One who reaps God's field. ",
  "9068":"The harvest of the earth is God's people on earth, the believers in Christ (1 Cor. 3:9). At His first coming to the earth, the Lord sowed Himself into His believers (Matt. 13:3-8, 24). All the believers since that time, who have received Him as the seed of life, have become God's crop on the earth. The first-ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation, as indicated in vv. 1-5. The majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped, raptured, at the end of the great tribulation. ",
  "9069":"Lit., dried. To be ripe is to be \"dried\" of all the earthly water. The suffering of the great tribulation, like the parching sun, will dry up the earthly waters from the believers who are left on the earth in the great tribulation, enabling the believers to ripen. ",
  "9070":"The sickle here signifies the angels sent by the Lord to reap the harvest (Matt. 13:39). ",
  "9071":"The reaping here will take place after Antichrist forces people to worship him and his image (v. 9). Hence, it refers to the rapture of the majority of the believers, who are left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation. ",
  "9072":"Him refers not to the Lord but to the angel in v. 17. ",
  "9073":"In the Bible the Jews are likened to the fig tree (Matt. 24:32), the believers are likened to wheat (Matt. 13:25, 30), and the wicked Gentiles are likened to the grapevine (v. 19), which is a counterfeit of the true vine composed of Christ and His members (John 15:1-6). The wheat is ripe when its water content is dried up, whereas the grapes are ripe when the water has filled them up. Fully ripened indicates that the Gentiles as the grapevine are filled to the brim with their sin and that the time of their judgment has come. ",
  "9074":"The great winepress of the fury of God is the war at Armageddon (16:12-16), which is in the valley of Jehoshaphat (Joel 3:9-16). All the Gentile evil worldly forces will be gathered there, and the Lord with His overcoming saints will fight against them and destroy them there (19:11-21; Joel 3:9-13; Isa. 63:1-6). ",
  "9075":"The city here is the city of Jerusalem. ",
  "9076":"The horses here correspond with the horses in 19:18. ",
  "9077":"A thousand six hundred stadia, 182 miles, is the distance from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon (16:16). ",
  "9078":"A stadion equals about 600 feet. ",
  "9079":"The seven plagues are the fury of God contained in the seven bowls (16:1). These plagues constitute the third woe (11:14), which comes at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (11:15, 18). ",
  "9080":"See note 6 in ch. 4. ",
  "9081":"These are the late overcomers who will pass through the great tribulation and overcome Antichrist and the worshipping of Antichrist. They will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected to reign with Christ in the millennium (20:4). ",
  "9082":"Standing on the glassy sea signifies that these ones have been (1) resurrected from the dead and (2) raptured to be above the lake of fire (which the glassy sea refers to and which is the second death &#151; note 6 in ch. 4; 20:14), that is, to be above God's eternal, fiery judgment (14:9-11). ",
  "9083":"The song of Moses, recorded in Exo. 15:1-18, praises God for the victory over the forces of Pharaoh gained by God's triumphant deliverance through the judging waters of the Red Sea. Moses and the children of Israel sang that song on the shore of the Red Sea. Now these late overcomers sing the song again, on the glassy sea, indicating that they are victorious over the power of Antichrist, who will be judged by God with the fire of the glassy sea (19:20). ",
  "9084":"The song of Moses, indicating God's triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people, praises God for His judgment, which is on the negative side; whereas the song of the Lamb, indicating Christ's redemption experienced by God's people in the presence of their enemy, praises God for Christ's redemption, which is on the positive side. The late overcomers are positioned to stand on the glassy sea because of two facts: (1) God's judgment over the enemy and (2) Christ's redemption for God's people. ",
  "9085":"God's ways are His governing principles, while God's works are His judgments (v. 4). Moses knew God's ways (principles), but the children of Israel knew only His works (acts) (Psa. 103:7). God's ways are righteous in His principles and true in His promises, while His works are great in manifestation and wonderful in nature. Your works here refers mainly to God's judgment, God's verdict, upon Antichrist (14:17-20). ",
  "9086":"Some MSS read, ages. ",
  "9087":"The Greek word refers to the sum of the qualities that fit and form the divine character. Hence, holy refers to God's nature, while righteous refers to God's principles. ",
  "9088":"Judgments that are made according to righteousness. ",
  "9089":"See note 19 in ch. 11. ",
  "9090":"The testimony is the law of God, which testifies God and was put into the ark (Exo. 25:16). Because the ark was put in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called \"the tabernacle of the testimony.\" The tabernacle here is the one in heaven. ",
  "9091":"The seven angels are clothed like priests (Ezek. 44:17). ",
  "9092":"This means that no one can enter the temple to pray in order to appease the fury of God until it is fully poured out upon the rebellious people instigated by Satan and influenced by Antichrist. ",
  "9093":"The bowls here signify that though the seven last plagues, the plagues of the seven bowls, are the ultimate fury of God, His fury is limited; otherwise, the entire earth with its inhabitants would be destroyed. For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God, in His judgment upon the earth, still places a limit on His ultimate fury. ",
  "9094":"In His ultimate fury God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast. This shows that what God does in His ultimate fury toward the rebellious ones is a reaction to what Antichrist does. ",
  "9095":"Or, every soul of life; referring to every animal that has a soul. ",
  "9096":"See note 4 in ch. 15. ",
  "9097":"Unlike 1:8 and 4:8, neither this verse nor 11:17 says \"who is coming.\" This proves that the Lord's coming back must be after 4:8 and before 11:17. See note 4 in ch. 1. ",
  "9098":"This is the praise from the altar concerning God's judgments over Antichrist's territory. ",
  "9099":"See note 3 in ch. 15. ",
  "9100":"The throne here indicates that the seven bowls are for the judging of the beast and of his kingdom and territory. ",
  "9101":"The plague of the second bowl is more severe than that of the second trumpet (8:8-9); the plague of the third bowl is more severe than that of the third trumpet (8:10-11); and the plague of the fourth bowl is more severe than that of the fourth trumpet (8:12). The plague of the fifth bowl, the judgment upon the throne of Antichrist and his kingdom, is related to the fifth trumpet, in which Antichrist, as the king of the demon possessed locusts, torments men (9:7-11); and the plague of the sixth bowl is related to the sixth trumpet (9:14), because the plagues of both the sixth bowl and the sixth trumpet are related to the same river, the Euphrates. ",
  "9102":"The unclean spirits will stir up the rebellious kings (v. 14) to send forth their forces to persecute God's people. Being spirits, the unclean spirits should be in the heavenlies, but having become frogs, they can move about only on the earth. This indicates that Satan and his power to act will be confined to the earth. ",
  "9103":"According to the context, this word must be spoken by the Lord at the end of the great tribulation, before the war at Armageddon. This proves that at that time there will still be believers (the remaining, living majority of the believers) left on the earth. To them, the appearing of the Lord in His coming back will still be like the coming of a thief, at an hour unknown to them. ",
  "9104":"At the end of the great tribulation three unclean spirits out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will go forth to stir up the kings of the whole inhabited earth and to gather their forces (vv. 13-14) &#151; including the two hundred million horsemen mentioned in 9:14-16 (see note 12) &#151; to the war at Armageddon, which will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. In that war Satan's intention will be to destroy Israel (Zech. 14:12) and fight against Christ and His army. For this he will use all of rebellious mankind (17:12-14; 19:11-19). Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy them all (19:20-21; Micah 4:11-13; Zeph. 3:8; Zech. 14:3, 12-15; 12:4, 9) and will save the nation of Israel (Zech. 12:3-8; 14:4-5; Joel 3:14-17). This is the treading of the winepress, which is recorded in 14:17-20, Isa. 63:1-6, and Joel 3:9-13. ",
  "9105":"The word is a Hebrew compound of Har, meaning mountain, and Megiddon, i.e., Megiddo (Judg. 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech. 12:11), meaning slaughter; hence, the mountain of slaughter. ",
  "9106":"The temple is for God's testimony, whereas the throne is for God's judgment. Out of the temple from the throne indicates that God's judgment comes out of God's testimony and is for God's testimony. Once the last bowl has been poured out, marking the end of the great tribulation, every negative thing will have been eradicated, and then the bride will appear (19:7-9). ",
  "9107":"Or, over, passed, accomplished. This refers to the fact that everything has been accomplished for God's judgment and for God's expression, God's testimony. ",
  "9108":"This earthquake is the same as that associated with the seventh trumpet (11:19). See note 19 in ch. 11. ",
  "9109":"The great city is the city of Jerusalem. See note 8 in ch. 11. ",
  "9110":"The religious, mysterious Babylon mentioned in 14:8 will be destroyed at the beginning of the great tribulation (see note 8 in ch. 14); therefore, Babylon the Great here, which will be destroyed immediately after the war at Armageddon at the end of the great tribulation, must be the material Babylon, the city of Rome. The Babylon in 14:8 corresponds with the one in ch. 17, while the Babylon here corresponds with the one in ch. 18. The sketches of the two Babylons are recorded in 14:8 and this verse; the details are given in chs. 17 and 18. ",
  "9111":"Rome gave the wine of the fury of her fornication to the nations (18:3). Now God in His vengeance gives her the wine of the fury of His wrath. ",
  "9112":"A talent equals about 100 pounds. ",
  "9113":"This proves that the people have no intention of repenting; rather, they will oppose God to the end. ",
  "9114":"Or, sentence, condemnation. ",
  "9115":"Great here corresponds with greater in Matt. 13:32. ",
  "9116":"Harlot here refers to the apostate Roman Catholic Church. A harlot does not have a husband. This indicates that God never admitted having any relationship with the apostate Roman Church. ",
  "9117":"What the apostate church commits is not adultery, the sin of an unfaithful spouse, but fornication, the sin of a harlot. This is more sinful than adultery. The fornication of the apostate church consists of her having sinful relationships with the kings of the earth for her profit, just as a harlot commits sin for gain. Hers is spiritual fornication. The kings of the earth commit fornication with her directly. ",
  "9118":"Wine here signifies the heretical doctrines of the apostate church in her fornicating relationships with the governments on the earth. These heretical doctrines confound, as wine does, those who become involved in her religion. This is the wine of her fornication. It is in an indirect manner that those who dwell on the earth are made drunk with this wine. ",
  "9119":"See note 10 in ch. 1. ",
  "9120":"A wilderness is a desert place. This indicates that the apostate church is in a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God. In order to show the apostle John that the apostate church is in such a desolate place, the angel carried him there. ",
  "9121":"Scarlet is dark red, and red is the color of the great dragon (see note 3 in ch. 12). This indicates that Antichrist will be one with Satan in appearance. ",
  "9122":"The beast here is both the Roman Empire and Antichrist. ",
  "9123":"Nearly all the Caesars called themselves god. This was sheer blasphemy against God. ",
  "9124":"See note 1 in ch. 13 and notes 9 and 10 in this chapter. ",
  "9125":"Purple signifies dignity with authority (John 19:2-3). The color purple is a blend of blue and red; it signifies the blending of heavenly things with earthly. This is the appearance of the apostate church. ",
  "9126":"Scarlet, dark red, is characteristic of the apostate Roman Church. It is found in many places in the Vatican; the most striking use of it is in the garb of the cardinals. ",
  "9127":"Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built (21:18-19, 21). But the woman here, the apostate church, is not built in a solid way with these precious things; she is only gilded with these treasures as ornaments for outward display. This is a deception intended to entice people. It is the harlot's false appearance. ",
  "9128":"In figure, gold signifies the divine nature of God. Hence, the golden cup here indicates that in outward appearance the apostate church does have something of God. But within, her \"golden cup\" is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication, full of idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things in a heretical religious relationship. Therefore, although the apostate Roman Catholic Church has certain holy things, she has mixed in many evil and unclean things. ",
  "9129":"Or, even. ",
  "9130":"Mystery here indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is not the material Babylon in ch. 18 but the religious one. The religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches. ",
  "9131":"Since the mother of the harlots is the apostate church, the harlots, the daughters of the apostate church, must be all the different sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teaching, practices, and traditions of the apostate Roman Church. The pure church life has no evil that has been transmitted from the apostate church. ",
  "9132":"Abominations are idols (Deut. 7:25-26), with which the apostate Roman Church is filled. ",
  "9133":"The Roman Church does not kill the saints directly but does so indirectly through the Roman Empire. She is drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. ",
  "9134":"Or, martyrs. The saints are those who are separated, sanctified, unto God and who live a holy life for God, even unto death. The witnesses are those who are a living testimony of the Lord Jesus and who are faithful unto death. The witnesses of Jesus are also saints; however, the saints may just live a separated and holy life, not complying with the apostate church, and may not come forward to testify against the apostasy of the Roman Church as did witnesses such as Antipas in 2:13. ",
  "9135":"The beast, who is Antichrist, \"was\" in the person of Caesar Nero before John wrote this book. He \"is not\" at the time of John's writing, because Nero had died by that time. That he \"is about to come up out of the abyss\" implies that Nero's spirit is now in the abyss and is about to emerge from it to take possession of the body of the slain and resuscitated Antichrist, as indicated in 13:3. ",
  "9136":"This indicates that Antichrist will perish, as described in 19:20 and 20:10; that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire. ",
  "9137":"Lit., scroll. ",
  "9138":"The city of Rome is built on seven mountains. These are signified by the seven heads of the beast on which the harlot sits. ",
  "9139":"The seven kings are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire. The first five \"have fallen\"; i.e., they died unnaturally (Judg. 3:25; 2 Sam. 1:10, 25, 27). Those five are Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book. The sixth, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he \"is.\" \"The other,\" the seventh, is Antichrist; he had \"not yet come\" at that time. When he comes, he will remain only a short time and then will be slain and will be resuscitated by the spirit of the fifth, who is Nero, to become the eighth. ",
  "9140":"Antichrist will be the coming seventh Caesar. But he is also the eighth. According to 13:3, Antichrist will be slain and resuscitated. In that resuscitation the spirit of Nero (the fifth Caesar), which will come up out of the abyss (when Satan is cast down to the earth &#151; 12:10, 13), will animate and resuscitate the dead body of the seventh Caesar, Antichrist, thereby imitating the resurrection of Christ. This one, composed of the fifth and seventh Caesars, is the eighth. Hence, he is \"out of the seven,\" having the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth. Therefore, he will be all the more capable, all the more intelligent, and all the more powerful to charm, deceive, and allure people, capturing those who do not believe in Christ. It is no wonder that people will marvel at the sight of such an extraordinary person and will follow him (v. 8; 13:3). ",
  "9141":"Ten kings will be raised up in the revived Roman Empire before the great tribulation. They will be one with Antichrist in opposing God and persecuting His people &#151; the Jews and the believers. These ten kings are likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (Dan. 2:42). They will submit themselves and their kingdoms to Antichrist (v. 17). ",
  "9142":"The mind expressed as opinion. ",
  "9143":"The war here is the same as that mentioned in 19:11-21; it is the war at Armageddon (16:14, 16). ",
  "9144":"Chosen is mentioned after called. To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord by virtue of an overcoming life. Today many are called, but in the future few will be chosen (Matt. 22:14). ",
  "9145":"The harlot's sitting on the waters, which are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues, is fulfilled by the historical fact of the apostate Roman Church's riding on peoples and nations throughout the world. ",
  "9146":"That the ten horns and the beast will hate the harlot and make her desolate means that Antichrist and the ten kings will persecute the apostate Roman Church. This will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation. (See note 8 in ch. 14.) They will make the Roman Church \"desolate and naked,\" meaning that they will destroy her, rob her of her riches, and expose her; they will \"eat her flesh,\" meaning that they will kill her members; and they will \"burn her utterly with fire,\" meaning that they will annihilate her altogether. This too indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is the religious Babylon. ",
  "9147":"It is of God that Antichrist and his ten kings destroy the apostate Roman Church. This kind of destruction should not be considered martyrdom but the avenging judgment of God. ",
  "9148":"See note 13. ",
  "9149":"While the harlot in v. 16 denotes the religious Babylon, signifying the Roman Church, the woman here denotes the material Babylon, signifying the city of Rome. This city is called \"the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.\" When John wrote this book, Rome was the city that had a kingdom over the kings of the earth. What Antichrist and his ten kings will hate is the harlot, the Roman Church, not the woman, the city of Rome, where their administration will be based. ",
  "9150":"This Angel with great authority is Christ. As He comes down out of heaven, the earth is illumined with His glory. In 10:1 Christ is still clothed with a cloud, and in 14:14 He is sitting on the cloud; whereas here His glory shines over the earth, indicating that His coming back to earth is nearer at hand than the coming mentioned in 10:1 and 14:14. He will come out of heaven, first in the cloud secretly, then on the cloud openly; eventually, He will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with His great authority. ",
  "9151":"This is Christ's coming (parousia) reaching the earth at the end of the great tribulation for Him to take full possession of the earth as His kingdom. At this time the material Babylon the Great will suffer judgment and fall. ",
  "9152":"This is the fall of the material Babylon, the city of Rome, at the end of the great tribulation (see notes 8 in ch. 14, 19 in ch. 16, and 5 and 18 in ch. 17). The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: (1) the literal aspect, referring to ancient Babel or Babylon (Gen. 11:9), today's Iraq; (2) the religious aspect, referring to the Roman Catholic Church, spoken of in ch. 17; and (3) the material aspect, referring to the city of Rome, mentioned in this chapter. ",
  "9153":"Or, prison. ",
  "9154":"Some MSS read, have fallen by. ",
  "9155":"Rome, signified by Babylon the Great in a twofold way, has both religious and material aspects. The nations have drunk of the wine ...and the kings of the earth have committed ...refers to the religious aspect (14:8; 17:2), while the merchants of the earth have become ... refers to the material aspect. ",
  "9156":"Since Babylon the Great has two aspects, to come out of her is to come out of both the religious Babylon and the material Babylon. God's people should come out of these two aspects of Babylon. ",
  "9157":"Lit., joined together. ",
  "9158":"Or, crimes, misdeeds. ",
  "9159":"Double recompense was required according to the Levitical law (Exo. 22:4, 7, 9). Here, that double recompense is doubled. ",
  "9160":"In 17:16 the religious Babylon is utterly burned. Here, the material Babylon is utterly burned. Chapter 17 records the destruction of the religious Babylon; ch. 18, the destruction of the material Babylon. ",
  "9161":"That the cargo listed in vv. 12-13 consists of various material things proves that Babylon the Great in this chapter is the material Babylon. The cargo is of seven categories: (1) ornaments, from gold to pearls; (2) clothing, from fine linen to scarlet; (3) furniture and decorations, from thyine wood to marble; (4) spices, from cinnamon to frankincense; (5) food, from wine to sheep; (6) transportation, horses and chariots; and (7) employment, slaves and souls of men. ",
  "9162":"An aromatic and coniferous tree. ",
  "9163":"A spice plant. ",
  "9164":"Lit., bodies; referring to the bodies of those who are in slavery. ",
  "9165":"Of the cargo sold by Babylon, the first item is gold and the last is the souls of men. Souls of men refers to men who sell themselves for employment. This depicts not only the coming Babylon but also today's world. People sell their soul, their life, i.e., themselves, to their occupation, neglecting God and their eternal destiny. ",
  "9166":"Lit., costliness. ",
  "9167":"Antichrist and his armies will be destroyed by Christ in one hour (17:12-14; 19:19-21), and the material Babylon the Great also will be destroyed by the Lord in one hour. Perhaps both of them will be destroyed by the Lord in the same hour of His coming to the earth in His shining glory (18:1; 2 Thes. 2:8). ",
  "9168":"This is a part of the answer to the martyrs' prayer in 6:9-10. ",
  "9169":"This will probably occur through the earthquake mentioned in 16:18-20. ",
  "9170":"Or, enchantment, poisonous charm. ",
  "9171":"The word, from Hebrew, is a compound of hallelu, praise, and jah, a shortened form of the name Jehovah; hence, it means praise Jehovah. It is used in Psa. 104:35 and at the beginning and end of Psa. 146--150. ",
  "9172":"Babylon the Great, in both its religious aspect and its material aspect. See note 4 in ch. 18. ",
  "9173":"Lit., from her hand. ",
  "9174":"The \"Hallelujah\" in vv. 1 and 3 is the praise of the great multitude of saints. Here, the twenty-four angelic elders and the four living creatures say \"Amen\" to the praise of the saints, and then, like the saints, they praise by saying \"Hallelujah!\" Hence, taken together, this is the praise of the saints, angels, and all creatures; it is their praise to the Triune God from the past to the present and for eternity. ",
  "9175":"This may be the voice of Christ as the Angel of God (7:2; 8:3; 10:1). ",
  "9176":"Like the sound of many waters, the praise of the great multitude of saints proceeds continually, and like the sound of mighty thunders, it displays solemnity. ",
  "9177":"After the rapture of the majority of the saints (14:16; 1 Thes. 4:15-16) and the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ for the giving of the reward (11:18; 2 Cor. 5:10), the events that immediately follow should be the marriage of the Lamb, and then the destruction of Antichrist and Babylon the Great (19:19-21; 18:1--19:4), which bring in the reign of God &#151; the kingdom of God (v. 6). For this reason, the great multitude of the saved rejoice and praise with hallelujahs (vv. 1, 3, 6), and the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them in praising God (v. 4). <br><br>   The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of the Lamb, and the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God's New Testament economy. God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, the overcoming believers, will be ready, and the kingdom of God will come. This corresponds with the Lord's prophecy in Matt. 26:29. ",
  "9178":"His wife refers to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to vv. 8-9, the wife, the bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium; whereas the bride, the wife, in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this aspect, building is needed. The overcomers not only are mature in life but also are built together as one bride. ",
  "9179":"Or, pure. Clean refers to the nature, whereas bright refers to the expression. ",
  "9180":"Or, righteous acts. The righteousnesses (plural) here are not the righteousness (i.e., Christ) that we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30). The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God, whereas here the righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective (Phil. 3:9) and enable them to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ. In Psa. 45:13-14 the queen has two garments: one corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our salvation, and the other with the subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory. The second garment is equivalent to the wedding garment in Matt. 22:11-12. ",
  "9181":"The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in Matt. 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers will be called to it; not all the saved ones will participate in it. The five foolish virgins in Matt. 25:8-13 will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be called to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers, who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will also be the bride of the Lamb. ",
  "9182":"The chief meal, taken usually in the evening. ",
  "9183":"The spirit of the prophecy is the reality, substance, disposition, and characteristic of the prophecy. Thus, the testimony of Jesus is the reality, substance, disposition, and characteristic of the prophecy of this book. ",
  "9184":"After the marriage dinner, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride (the overcoming believers called to the marriage dinner) as His army to fight against Antichrist and the kings under him with their armies at Armageddon. ",
  "9185":"Christ is faithful both to God and to those who believe in Him. In His faithfulness He defeats and destroys those who oppose God and persecute the believers. He is also true in carrying out God's economy and in caring for those who believe in Him. ",
  "9186":"Christ is faithful and true both to God and to His believers, and He is righteous to those who oppose and rebel against God. In righteousness He will defeat Antichrist and judge the rebels who follow him. ",
  "9187":"Christ's flaming eyes are for the carrying out of His judgment. ",
  "9188":"Because Christ has been crowned with many kinds of glory (Heb. 2:9; 1 Pet. 1:11 and note 6), He wears many diadems. Every kind of glory is a diadem. These crowns of glory are the issues of the things that Christ accomplished. In the glorious issues of His accomplishments He will fight for God and destroy all those who rebel against God, putting them to shame for eternity. ",
  "9189":"This indicates that there are certain aspects of Christ that we have not experienced and that only He Himself knows. It also indicates that the Christ whom we experience is inexhaustible. ",
  "9190":"Christ's being clothed with a garment dipped in blood is related to His treading the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God (v. 15; Isa. 63:1-3) at Armageddon (16:14, 16), where the blood will rise up to the bridles of the horses (14:20). ",
  "9191":"The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ imparts life as grace to God's chosen people in the Gospel of John (John 1:1, 4, 14), but He executes God's judgment upon the rebellious people in the Revelation of John. ",
  "9192":"The armies here are the called and chosen believers in 17:14 and those who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb in v. 9, that is, those who constitute the bride of Christ. ",
  "9193":"The garment of the overcoming believers qualifies them both to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb (vv. 8-9) and to fight with the Lord against His enemy. ",
  "9194":"The sword, which proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the Word of God, is the word that will judge the rebellious (John 12:48). ",
  "9195":"To shepherd here is to rule; the iron rod signifies strong power. First, with His judging word Christ will smite the nations; then, with His strong power He will shepherd those who remain. His ruling with strong power is His shepherding. He will rule over the nations by shepherding them. ",
  "9196":"See note 19 in ch. 14. ",
  "9197":"Christ's garment signifies Christ's attributes, His character, especially His righteousness in His humanity; whereas His thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability. ",
  "9198":"The great dinner of God is in contrast to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. The latter is for the called overcomers; the former is for the invited birds. ",
  "9199":"Lit., captains over 1,000 men. ",
  "9200":"The kings of the earth (16:12-14) include especially the ten kings under Antichrist (17:12-14). ",
  "9201":"The armies include the two hundred million horsemen from the rising of the sun (9:14-16; 16:12). ",
  "9202":"This war will take place at Armageddon (16:14, 16), at the valley of Jehoshaphat (Joel 3:9-16; Zech. 14:2-3, 12-15), which is very close to Jerusalem. This war will be the treading of the great winepress of the fury of God (see 14:17-20 and note 19 there). ",
  "9203":"Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire (cf. 20:10, 15). Unlike all the others who perish, they will be cast alive into the lake of fire, without passing through death and resurrection. <br><br>   At this point we can see that once the seventh trumpet is sounded, on the same day, the last day of the great tribulation, the following events will all take place: (1) the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ; (2) the dead saints will be resurrected and will be raptured with the living saints; (3) the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured; (4) Christ will execute the judgment at His judgment seat for the rewarding of the overcomers; (5) the marriage of the Lamb and the overcomers will take place; (6) Christ and His newly-wed overcomers will come to the earth to defeat Antichrist and destroy those who destroy the earth in the war at Armageddon, and to cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire; (7) by the war at Armageddon Christ will rescue Israel from Antichrist's besieging, and the whole house of Israel will repent and be saved; (8) the material Babylon the Great will be destroyed; and (9) at the same time the seven bowls will be poured out. The war at Armageddon will occur at the time of the sixth bowl. The various plagues of the seven bowls will be executed by God on the same day, perhaps at the time when the few positive events mentioned previously will occur. ",
  "9204":"After the defeat of Antichrist, Satan is bound and imprisoned that the rebellious earth may be cleared up and the kingdom of Christ may come (vv. 4-6). ",
  "9205":"They refers to the overcomers. They are now sitting upon thrones, and authority to judge has been given to them. Having authority to judge means having the kingdom (cf. Dan. 7:10, 18, 22). This indicates that they have received the kingdom and are enjoying it. ",
  "9206":"These are the ones who are martyred throughout the church age, as mentioned in 6:9. ",
  "9207":"These are the ones who are martyred during the great tribulation (13:7, 15). ",
  "9208":"I.e., were resurrected. ",
  "9209":"These are the unsaved who will participate in the resurrection of judgment after the millennium (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24; Rev. 20:12). ",
  "9210":"Or, best. The first resurrection is the best one. It is not only the resurrection of life (John 5:29; 1 Cor. 15:23b; 1 Thes. 4:16) but also the resurrection of reward (Luke 14:14), the out-resurrection, i.e., the outstanding resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought (Phil. 3:11), the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers, which enables them to reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom (vv. 4, 6). Hence, blessed is he who has part in the first resurrection (v. 6). ",
  "9211":"Or, happy. The highest blessing is to inherit the kingdom of God manifested on earth and even to be the co-kings of Christ within the kingdom. ",
  "9212":"Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living overcomers, such as the firstfruits in 14:1-5, have part in the issue of the first resurrection. ",
  "9213":"See note 11 in ch. 2. ",
  "9214":"The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium (2:26-27; 12:5). As priests, they satisfy God and Christ, who enjoy their service, and as kings they reign for God and represent God, shepherding man for man's enjoyment and satisfaction. This is a reward to the overcomers. The believers who are defeated in this age will forfeit this reward. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the millennium, these defeated ones will participate in the blessing of this reward, which will be to serve God and represent God in the kingship in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:3, 5). ",
  "9215":"Some ancient authorities have the definite article the. ",
  "9216":"The abyss (v. 3) will be a temporary prison for the devil. After the thousand years, he will be released from his prison to be God's tool to test mankind for the last time. ",
  "9217":"Gog and Magog, according to Ezek. 38:2-3 and 39:1-2, must be Russia. Ezekiel 38:2 (ASV) indicates that Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, which correspond with Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk. Ezekiel 39:2 (ASV) refers to these places as \"the uttermost parts of the north.\" What is mentioned concerning Gog and Magog in Ezek. 38 and 39 will occur before the millennium, whereas what is recorded concerning them in this chapter will take place after the millennium. This verse shows that Satan's deceiving of the nations that are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of Gog and Magog. This may indicate that in mankind's last rebellion against God, which will be instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead and the nations will follow. ",
  "9218":"This will be the last war on earth. It will be caused by mankind's last rebellion, which will be instigated by Satan, God's enemy, after the millennium. Although mankind will be in a restored state for one thousand years, man's rebellious nature will still remain. It will be exposed by Satan's last instigation and will be purged away by the Lord's final judgment on mankind. ",
  "9219":"The camp of the saints is the lodging place of the overcoming believers, who compose the heavenly armies (19:14) camping on earth. The beloved city is the city of Jerusalem, the dwelling place of the remnant of Israel. The overcoming believers and the remnant of Israel are God's faithful people on earth in the millennium, who stand with God and for God. At the end of the millennium, Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack God's people. ",
  "9220":"Some ancient authorities insert, from God. ",
  "9221":"The lake of fire has been prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). However, the beast and the false prophet, as well as the \"goats\" in Matt. 25:32-33, 41, are cast into it a thousand years earlier than the devil (19:20). After the thousand years, the devil also is thrown into it. ",
  "9222":"White here signifies righteous, indicating that the Lord's great throne, which is for His judgment, is righteous. ",
  "9223":"Him must refer to the Lord Jesus. God the Father has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22) and has ordained Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1; Rom. 2:16). Matthew 25:31-46 speaks of the Lord as the One who will judge the living before the millennium. Here, the Lord is the One who will judge the dead after the millennium. ",
  "9224":"The old heavens and the old earth will be changed (Heb. 1:11-12). The old heavens will pass away, their elements being burned and dissolved, and the old earth will be burned up (2 Pet. 3:10). Out of this change will issue the new heaven and new earth (21:1) as the universe of the new creation, which will serve as the location for the New Jerusalem in eternity. ",
  "9225":"Standing here indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment, after the millennium (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24). ",
  "9226":"These scrolls are the record of the unbelievers' works and deeds; the unbelievers will be judged according to what is recorded in the scrolls. ",
  "9227":"This is the record of the names of the believers (13:8; 17:8; Luke 10:20). ",
  "9228":"Since the dead unbelievers who were drowned in the sea are included among those in Hades, the dead given up by the sea must not include any unbelieving human beings; they may be the spirits (the demons today &#151; Matt. 8:31-32; 12:43) of the living beings of the preadamic age (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). This may indicate that today's demons will be judged at the great white throne along with the unbelieving human beings. ",
  "9229":"The lake of fire is the \"trash can\" for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast. Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord (1 Cor. 15:26). ",
  "9230":"In the first death, the soul and spirit of fallen men are separated from their body and perish in the section of suffering in Hades (Luke 16:22-24). In the second death, their soul and spirit, after being rejoined to their body in resurrection, are cast with their body into the lake of fire. This means that the unbelievers' whole being &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; will perish in eternal torment in the lake of fire. ",
  "9231":"The perishing unbelievers will be judged according to the scrolls, which are a record of their works (vv. 12-13), but they will be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life. This indicates that they are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds but perish because of their unbelief, which issues in their not having their names written in the book of life. Not believing in the Lord Jesus is the unique sin that causes people to perish (John 16:9). ",
  "9232":"Lit., scroll. ",
  "9233":"The lake of fire has been prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). Since the unbelievers have followed the devil, they will share the devil's judgment (John 16:11) and will become joint partakers of the devil's eternal torment. The demons, also having followed the devil, will share the same destiny. ",
  "9234":"In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression that He might be fully expressed and glorified (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:9-12). For this, He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. After the creation of the world, there are four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, from Adam to Moses (Rom. 5:14); the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ (John 1:17); the dispensation of grace, from Christ's first coming to the restoration of all things at Christ's second coming (Acts 3:20-21); and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ's second coming to the end of the millennium (11:15; 20:4, 6). God uses these four dispensations to perfect and complete His chosen people that they may be His eternal corporate expression for the accomplishing of His purpose. All four dispensations belong to the old heaven and old earth. Although the dispensation of the kingdom is the dispensation of restoration, it still will take place in the old heaven and old earth, because God's perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be finished until the end of that dispensation. When God finishes this work through the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), into which the New Jerusalem will come to be God's eternal expression. ",
  "9235":"According to the principle revealed in the Bible, God does not want the first, whether man or thing (Exo. 12:12), but the second. Hence, whatever is the first, whether heaven, earth, man, or thing, will be annulled (v. 4; cf. 1 Cor. 15:47; Heb. 8:7, 13). If the Greek word for first is rendered former, the spiritual significance is missed. ",
  "9236":"The sea is a result of the waters of judgment, which God used to judge the preadamic world (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). The work of God's re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the result of the waters of judgment (Gen. 1:9-10; Jer. 5:22). The living creatures of the preadamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the sea's inhabitants, the demons. After they have been dealt with by Christ and His believers (Matt. 8:29-32; Luke 10:17; Acts 16:16-18; 19:12) and the sea has given them up to the judgment of the great white throne (20:13), the sea will not be needed. Since the work of God's re-creation, God's intention has been to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons. Hence, the sea is no more indicates that Satan and his evil followers will all be dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth. ",
  "9237":"The revelation of this book is composed of signs (see note 1 in ch. 1). Because of the profundity of the great and important matters in this book, it is difficult for man to speak of them exhaustively in plain words. Thus, all these matters are symbolized and depicted by signs, such as the lampstands, signifying the churches, and stars, signifying the messengers of the churches (ch. 1); Jezebel, signifying the degraded, fornicating Roman Church (ch. 2b); jasper and precious stones, signifying life and the redeeming God (4:3); the Lion and the Lamb, signifying the overcoming and redeeming Christ (ch. 5); the four horses, signifying the gospel, war, famine, and the spreading abroad of death (ch. 6a); the universal woman, signifying God's redeemed throughout the generations, her child, signifying the strong, overcoming ones among God's redeemed, and the dragon, the serpent, signifying the cruel and subtle Satan, the devil (ch. 12); the beast out of the sea, signifying Antichrist, and the beast out of the earth, signifying the false prophet (ch. 13); the harvest, signifying the people growing under God's cultivation, and the firstfruits, signifying the ones who ripen early among those who are growing under God's cultivation (ch. 14); Babylon the Great, signifying Rome, in both its religious aspect and its material aspect (chs. 17--18); and the bride, signifying the saints who are mature and are prepared to be Christ's counterpart (ch. 19a). Besides these, there are many other signs. The final sign, which is also the greatest, is the New Jerusalem, signifying the composition of the totality of God's redeemed saints throughout the generations, who have been regenerated, transformed, and glorified. It is not a material, lifeless city but a corporate living person as the bride, having Christ, such a wonderful person, as her husband (v. 2). <br><br>   The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations. It is the bride of Christ as His counterpart (John 3:29) and the holy city of God as His habitation, His tabernacle (v. 3). This is the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22), which God has prepared for us and which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob long after (Heb. 11:10, 16). This is also the Jerusalem which is above and which is our mother (Gal. 4:26). As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ. As the holy city of God, she is wholly sanctified unto God and fully saturated with God's holy nature to be His habitation. <br><br>   In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) and a dwelling place for Himself (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The spouse is for His satisfaction in love, and the dwelling place is for His rest in expression. Both of these aspects will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem. In her, God will have the fullest satisfaction in love and the utmost rest in expression for eternity. ",
  "9238":"After all God's redeemed saints are raptured to the heavens, they will constitute the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from God. This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven but the New Jerusalem on the new earth. ",
  "9239":"The New Jerusalem is a bride, indicating that she is not a material city but a corporate person. To Christ she is a bride for His satisfaction; to God she is a tabernacle in which He can rest and through which He can express Himself. ",
  "9240":"As God's habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity. The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle (Exo. 25:8-9; Lev. 26:11). That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God's tabernacle among men (John 1:14) and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God's dwelling place. This tabernacle will also be the eternal dwelling place of God's redeemed people. God will overshadow us with Christ. (See note 15 in ch. 7.) Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual habitation for both God and us. ",
  "9241":"In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears. ",
  "9242":"Since death will be wholly swallowed up by life (1 Cor. 15:54) and will be cast into the lake of fire (20:14), in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more death. ",
  "9243":"Lit., first. ",
  "9244":"They refers to these words in v. 5. ",
  "9245":"The meaning of overcomes here is different from that in chs. 2 and 3, where the word is used seven times. Here it means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4-5. The overcoming in chs. 2 and 3 qualifies the overcoming believers to participate in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God's dispensational administration, whereas the overcoming here qualifies all believers to participate in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as the common portion of God's eternal salvation. ",
  "9246":"The peoples in v. 3 will be the nations in v. 24. In the new heaven and new earth they will be God's people and not God's sons. They will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem and will enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and new earth. (See note 24.) Son in this verse does not refer to God's people but to God's redeemed saints throughout the generations. The sons of God will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb, and reign for eternity (22:3-5). ",
  "9247":"I.e., liars. ",
  "9248":"In the old heaven and old earth there is the sea of water to hold the result of God's judgment, whereas in the new heaven and new earth there will be the lake of fire to replace the sea. All negative and filthy things, after being judged by God, will be cast into the lake of fire, where they will suffer the second death and be tormented by being burned in fire and brimstone for eternity (14:10-11). According to 22:15, the lake of fire will be outside the New Jerusalem, as Gehenna (which signifies the lake of fire &#151; Matt. 5:22 and note 8), that is, as Topheth, a place for filthy things (Jer. 19:11-13), was outside the old Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33). The lake of fire is much more restricted than the sea of water. ",
  "9249":"It was one of the seven angels who executed the seven last plagues who showed the New Jerusalem to John. This signifies that the judgment of the seven bowls is for the New Jerusalem. ",
  "9250":"A bride is mainly for the wedding day, while a wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years, which is like one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, to the ages of the ages without end. ",
  "9251":"The great and high mountain is in contrast to the wilderness in 17:3. That he might see Babylon, the great harlot, John was carried to the wilderness. That he might see the bride, the New Jerusalem, John was carried to a great and high mountain. We need to be lifted up to a \"high mountain\" that we may see God's dwelling place for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose. ",
  "9252":"The glory of God is the expression of God, God expressed. We have been predestined for this glory and called to this glory (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12). We are being transformed into this glory (2 Cor. 3:18) and will be brought into it (Heb. 2:10). Eventually, we will be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17, 30) and bear the glory of God for God's expression in the New Jerusalem. ",
  "9253":"Lit., luminary, or, light-bearer. Today the believers, as children of light (Eph. 5:8), are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14), shining in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation (Phil. 2:15). Eventually, the New Jerusalem, as a composition of all the saints, will be the light-bearer, shining forth God as light over the nations around her (v. 24). ",
  "9254":"The precious stone is not the light but the light-bearer. It does not have light in itself, but the light, which is God, has been wrought into it and shines out through it. This indicates that since we are part of the coming New Jerusalem, we must be transformed into precious stones, with God being wrought into our being as the shining light, that we may be the light-bearer shining as God's expression. ",
  "9255":"God's appearance is like jasper (4:3 and note 1). The light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper stone. The New Jerusalem bears the appearance of God and expresses God by her shining. ",
  "9256":"The wall is for separation and protection. New Jerusalem will be absolutely separated unto God and will fully protect the interests of God. Its wall will be great and high. Today all believers need such a great and high wall for their separation and protection. ",
  "9257":"The gates are for communication, for coming in and going out. Twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God's administration. Hence, twelve gates indicates that the communication in the New Jerusalem is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God's administration. ",
  "9258":"In God's eternal economy, angels are ministering spirits (Heb. 1:14). They serve those who inherit salvation and who participate in the eternal blessing of the New Jerusalem, the center of the new heaven and new earth. They will be the gatekeepers of our possession, while we will be the enjoyers of the rich inheritance in God's eternal economy. ",
  "9259":"Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of the New Jerusalem. The law watches and observes to insure that all the communications, the comings in and goings out, of the holy city meet the law's requirements. That the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed on the twelve gates signifies that the twelve tribes of Israel are the entrance into the holy city; as such, they lead people, through the preaching of the gospel, into the riches of the Triune God to enjoy the supply in the city. <br><br>   The mentioning of Israel here also indicates that the New Jerusalem includes all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament. ",
  "9260":"The city lies square (v. 16), with three gates on each of the four sides. The east side, at the front, toward the glory of the sunrise, ranks first; the north side, at the top, ranks second; the south side, at the bottom, ranks third; and the west side, at the rear, ranks fourth. The gates on the four sides face the four directions of the earth, signifying that the entrance into the holy city is available to all the peoples on earth. (Cf. the four heads of the river in Gen. 2:10-14.) That there are three gates on each side signifies that the three of the Trinity &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; work together to bring people into the holy city. This is indicated in the three parables in Luke 15 and implied in the Lord's word in Matt. 28:19. To be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the real entrance into the holy city. That there are three gates on each of the four sides, three times four being twelve, also implies that the Triune God is mingled with man, the creature. (The number four signifies the creatures &#151; 4:6.) ",
  "9261":"The foundations here are not the foundation that is Christ, mentioned in 1 Cor. 3:10-11. Rather, they are the twelve apostles of the Lamb. Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). Since in eternity there will be no more need for the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles. ",
  "9262":"The apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God. While entrance into the holy city is according to the law of God, the city is built upon the grace of God. Apostles here implies that the New Jerusalem is composed not only of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, but also of the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles. ",
  "9263":"A reed is for measuring, and measuring is for taking possession (Ezek. 40:5; Zech. 2:1-2; Rev. 11:1). Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, golden here indicates that the city, its gates, and its wall are measured according to God's divine nature. Anything that does not match the divine nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem. The entire city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the divine nature of God; hence, it is fit to be God's possession. ",
  "9264":"Square here indicates that the New Jerusalem is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, and not in the least oblique. ",
  "9265":"Twelve thousand is one thousand times twelve. Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God's administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this. ",
  "9266":"A stadion equals about 600 feet. ",
  "9267":"The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, in both the tabernacle and the temple, were equal in length, breadth, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). Hence, that the length and the breadth and the height of New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies. In it, all God's redeemed ones will serve and worship God, will see and touch God's presence, and will live and dwell in God's presence for eternity. ",
  "9268":"A hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve. Twelve times twelve signifies the absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions. How perfect and complete is the wall of the holy city in God's eternal administration! <br><br>   The city proper is like a mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia, whereas the wall itself, from the foundation to the top, has a height of a hundred and forty-four cubits. ",
  "9269":"It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels (Matt. 22:30). Hence, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel indicates that the wall of the city is not natural but is in resurrection. ",
  "9270":"Jasper is a transformed precious stone (1 Cor. 3:12). God's appearance is like jasper (4:3 and note 1 there). The jasper wall signifies that the whole city, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God. ",
  "9271":"Or, clear, clean. ",
  "9272":"Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, the city's being of pure gold signifies that New Jerusalem is altogether of God's divine nature and takes God's divine nature as its element. Pure gold, like clear glass indicates that the whole city is transparent and is not in the least opaque. ",
  "9273":"Or, pure, clean. ",
  "9274":"The New Jerusalem is a city of foundations (Heb. 11:10). These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14), each of whom is signified by a precious stone. Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning a stone (John 1:42). Later, the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church (Matt. 16:18). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building. Every believer needs to be thus regenerated and transformed that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem. <br><br>   The colors of the foundation's twelve precious stones, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first stone is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, the eleventh and twelfth are purple. The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors have the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God's faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17) and that the foundation of the city is trustworthy and reliable. ",
  "9275":"The first layer of the wall's foundation, as well as the entire wall of New Jerusalem, is built with jasper (v. 18). This indicates that the main material in the building of the holy city is jasper. Since jasper signifies God expressed in His transmittable glory (4:3), the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory (v. 11). ",
  "9276":"Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us into precious pearls for the building of God's eternal expression. That the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This meets the requirement of the law, which is represented by Israel and is under the observing of the guarding angels (v. 12). <br><br>   The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God. First, the city proper, with its street, is of pure gold (vv. 18, 21). Gold, the symbol of the divine nature of God, signifies the Father as the source, from whom the element for the substantial existence of the city is produced. Second, the twelve gates of the city are pearls, which signify the Son's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained. Third, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones, signifying the Spirit's work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God's eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His all-permeating glory. In the garden of Eden these three kinds of treasures merely existed as materials (Gen. 2:11-12), whereas in the city of New Jerusalem these precious materials become a builded city for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, which is to have a corporate expression. ",
  "9277":"Each gate of the holy city is one pearl, signifying that the entrance to the city is unique and is once for all; that is, we can enter the city only through the once-for-all regeneration accomplished by Christ's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection. ",
  "9278":"The gates are for the entrance into the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living, in the city. The entrance into the city is through Christ's death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living, in the city is according to the divine nature of God, signified by the street being of pure gold. After the saints enter through regeneration, they must daily live and walk in God's divine nature as the way. The divine nature of God is their pathway. ",
  "9279":"The pure gold, which symbolizes the street and the city proper of the New Jerusalem, is like clear glass (v. 18), signifying that the whole city is transparent. Although the pearls may be opaque, every one of them is a great open gate, which will not be shut by day or by night (v. 25). ",
  "9280":"In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was a precursor of the temple of God. New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God (v. 3) will be the temple of God. This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the temple of God will be enlarged into a city. That the three dimensions of the city are equal (v. 16) indicates that the city as a whole will be the Holy of Holies, the inner temple. Hence, there will be no temple in it. ",
  "9281":"The Greek word denotes the inner temple. This inner temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb Themselves will be the place in which we serve God. The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for the redeemed saints to dwell in. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man for eternity. ",
  "9282":"In the millennium the light of the sun and the moon will be intensified (Isa. 30:26). But in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth there will be no need of the shining of the sun or of the moon. The sun and moon will be present in the new heaven and new earth, but their shining will not be needed in the New Jerusalem, for God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly there. ",
  "9283":"The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Since the holy city will be illumined by such a divine light, it will need no other light, whether created by God or made by man (22:5). ",
  "9284":"At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed as a result of the sixth and seventh trumpets. The rest will be judged by Christ at the throne of His glory when He comes back to earth. The condemned ones, the \"goats,\" will be cursed and will perish in the lake of fire, while the justified ones, the \"sheep,\" will be blessed and will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:31-46). Unlike the New Testament believers, the \"sheep\" will not be saved and regenerated; they will only be restored to the original state of man as he was created by God. They will be the nations as citizens of the millennial kingdom, in which the overcoming believers will be the kings (20:4, 6) and the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests (Zech. 8:20-23). After the millennial kingdom, a part of these nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven (20:7-9). The rest will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations, which will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light. They will be the peoples mentioned in vv. 3 and 4. They, as created but unregenerated men, will be maintained to live forever in their created state through the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (22:2). Even for them there will be no more death (v. 4). Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, neither will they be in darkness. ",
  "9285":"Cf. Isa. 2:5. ",
  "9286":"The kings of the earth here are the kings of the nations in the new earth. The redeemed and regenerated saints will be kings over these kings (22:5), and Christ will be the King of kings for eternity. ",
  "9287":"Glory here refers to splendor (Matt. 5:16; see note 9 in Heb. 2). ",
  "9288":"The wall of the city will separate the city from the nations, but the gates will keep the city continually open to them. ",
  "9289":"In the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction, for there, God Himself as the brighter light will shine continuously day and night. ",
  "9290":"See note 24. ",
  "9291":"Honor refers to preciousness in status and dignity in position (cf. Esth. 1:4). ",
  "9292":"Since the nations living on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem will bring their glory and honor into the city, they surely are included among those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. ",
  "9293":"Lit., scroll. ",
  "9294":"He refers to the angel in 21:9. ",
  "9295":"The river here, typified by the rivers in Gen. 2:10-14, Psa. 46:4, and Ezek. 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow. It is one river, flowing to the four corners of the holy city, like the one river in Gen. 2:10-14, which parts into four heads. As indicated in John 7:38, this one river with its riches becomes many rivers in our experience of the different aspects of the riches of God's Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2; 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23). ",
  "9296":"The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. It is typified by the water that came out of the riven rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34). Here, the water of life becomes a river, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Thus this city is filled with the divine life that it may express God in His glory of life. ",
  "9297":"The water of life is bright as crystal, having no dimness or opaqueness. When this water of life flows in us, it purifies us and makes us as transparent as crystal. ",
  "9298":"The throne of God and of the Lamb, showing that there is one throne for both God and the Lamb, indicates that God and the Lamb are one &#151; the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the very God who sits on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God &#151; God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, who is symbolized by the water of life &#151; dispenses Himself to His redeemed under His headship (implied in the authority of the throne) for eternity. ",
  "9299":"The street of the holy city is pure gold (21:21). Gold symbolizes the divine nature. That the river of water of life proceeds \"in the middle of its street\" signifies that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God's redeemed people. Where the divine life flows, there the divine nature is as the holy way by which God's people walk; and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. Thus, God's river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy the river by walking in this way of life. ",
  "9300":"That the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy. This tree fulfills for eternity what God intended from the beginning (Gen. 2:9). The tree of life was closed to man because of his fall (Gen. 3:22-24), but it was opened to the believers through the redemption of Christ (Heb. 10:19-20). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers' common portion (John 6:35, 57). In the millennial kingdom the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be a dispensational reward to the overcoming believers (2:7). Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be the eternal portion of all God's redeemed (vv. 14, 19). Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, signified by the street. This is the supply of the holy city, and this is the way the city is supplied. ",
  "9301":"The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God's redeemed for eternity. They will be continually fresh, being produced every month, twelve fruits yearly. That the tree of life bears twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and is sufficient for the carrying out of God's eternal administration. ",
  "9302":"Lit., according to each month. ",
  "9303":"Month indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon still will be there to divide the twelve months. The sun also will be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each. While the number that represents the church is seven, signifying that God in His present dispensation is added to His creature, man, the number that represents the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man. In the New Jerusalem are the twelve foundations, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles; the twelve gates, which are twelve pearls, inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes; and the twelve fruits of the tree of life. With regard to space, the city proper is twelve thousand stadia, one thousand times twelve, in each of its three dimensions, and its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, twelve times twelve, in height. With regard to time, in the new heaven and new earth there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly. ",
  "9304":"The leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations. In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man's deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their inward life and life supply, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity, whereas the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation, that they may live the human life forever. ",
  "9305":"Or, anything accursed. ",
  "9306":"The curse came in through Adam's fall (Gen. 3:17) and was dealt with by Christ's redemption (Gal. 3:13). Since in the new heaven and new earth the fall will be no more, there will no longer be a curse. ",
  "9307":"The throne of God and of the Lamb is one of the blessings that God's redeemed will enjoy in eternity. They will no longer suffer any curse; the throne of God and of the Lamb will be their eternal portion. ",
  "9308":"The Greek word denotes serving as priests. To serve God and the Lamb also will be a blessing to God's redeemed in eternity. ",
  "9309":"Him, like His in v. 4, refers to God and the Lamb; God and the Lamb are one in eternity. ",
  "9310":"To see the face of God and of the Lamb and to have His name on their foreheads also will be blessings of the Triune God enjoyed by God's redeemed in eternity. ",
  "9311":"See note 25 in ch. 21. ",
  "9312":"The light of a lamp is made by man, and the light of the sun is created by God. ",
  "9313":"To be shined upon by the Lord God will be another blessing to God's redeemed in eternity. ",
  "9314":"To reign forever will be the final blessing to God's redeemed in eternity. ",
  "9315":"He refers to the angel in 21:9. ",
  "9316":"\"The Lord, the God,\" who sent His angel to show the things in this book is the Lord Jesus (1:1; 22:16). ",
  "9317":"In this book the Lord God is the God of the spirits of the prophets. This indicates that all the prophecies in this book are inspired by the very God who inspired the spirits of the prophets in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. It also indicates that these prophecies are related to those in the Old Testament and the New Testament, all of which were spoken by the prophets in their spirit, which was under the inspiration of God. Hence, to comprehend these prophecies, we too need to be in our spirit under God's anointing. ",
  "9318":"\"I come quickly\" is the Lord's warning. If we heed this warning, we will be blessed; otherwise, we will forfeit the blessing. ",
  "9319":"Daniel's prophecies were sealed because they were given long before the time of the end, whereas the prophecies of this book should not be sealed, for the time is near. ",
  "9320":"In the age of this book, whatever one is, whether unrighteous or righteous, whether filthy or holy, is a serious matter. To be righteous is to walk outwardly according to the righteous ways of God, whereas to be holy is to live inwardly according to the holy nature of God. In the age of this book we must walk and live in this way that we may receive the reward; otherwise, we will be condemned as unrighteous and filthy and will receive punishment at the Lord's coming back (v. 12). ",
  "9321":"The Lord repeats His warning, \"I come quickly,\" so that we will consider His reward, to be rendered at His coming back. ",
  "9322":"Lit., wages. At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 14:10; Matt. 16:27). ",
  "9323":"This is the Lord's declaration at the close of this book; it corresponds with what God declared in the opening of this book (1:8). This indicates that the Lord Jesus is the very God. ",
  "9324":"The Lord Jesus is not only the First but also the Beginning, and not only the Last but also the End. The First indicates that none is before Him, and the Last that none is after Him; whereas the Beginning indicates that He is the origination of all things, and the End that He is the consummation of all things. Hence, the indication here is not only that there is nothing before or after the Lord Jesus but also that there is no origination or consummation without Him. ",
  "9325":"This verse can be considered a promise of the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life; and the second half of v. 17 can be considered a call to take the water of life, which is the life- giving Spirit. Thus this book ends in a promise and a call, both of which are for eating and drinking the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit. ",
  "9326":"The robes here symbolize the conduct of the believers. To wash their robes is to keep their conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb (7:14; 1 John 1:7). This gives them the right to participate in the tree of life and to enter into the city. Both the tree of life and the city will be an enjoyment to them in eternity. ",
  "9327":"Lit., their authority will be over the tree of life and they may enter ... ",
  "9328":"After being created, man was put before the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9), indicating that he was privileged to partake of it. But because of the fall of man, the way to the tree of life was closed to man by God's glory, holiness, and righteousness (Gen. 3:24). Through Christ's redemption, which fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life was opened again to believers (Heb. 10:19-20). Hence, those who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the Paradise of God, in eternity (2:7). ",
  "9329":"To enter by the gates into the city is to enter the New Jerusalem, as a realm of God's eternal blessing, by regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-imparting Christ. (See note 21 in ch. 21.) ",
  "9330":"Outside means outside the city, where the lake of fire, which holds all the sinners who have perished, will be located. (See note 8 in ch. 21.) ",
  "9331":"Lit., upon, or, over. ",
  "9332":"The testimony of this book was made by the Lord Jesus for the churches. Hence, to comprehend and keep this testimony, we need to be in the churches and for the churches. ",
  "9333":"In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David; in His humanity, Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David. Hence, He is the Lord as the Root of David, and He is also the son, the shoot, of David as the Offspring of David (Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Jer. 23:5). ",
  "9334":"At His coming back Christ will be the rising sun to His people generally (Mal. 4:2) but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly. The latter will be a reward to the overcomers (2:28). Christ's being the Root and Offspring of David is related to Israel and the kingdom, whereas Christ's being the bright morning star is related to the church and the rapture. The morning star appears before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn. The great tribulation will be this darkest time, after which the day of the kingdom will dawn. In the kingdom the Lord will appear publicly to His people as the sun, but before the great tribulation He will appear privately to His overcomers as the morning star. ",
  "9335":"In chs. 2 and 3 it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church's experience of the Spirit has improved to the extent that she has become one with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. <br><br>   The entire revelation of the Bible shows us the love story of a universal couple. That is, the sovereign Lord, who created the universe and all things, the Triune God &#151; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &#151; who went through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who ultimately became the life-giving Spirit, is joined in marriage to the created, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man &#151; composed of spirit, soul, and body &#151; who ultimately constitutes the church, the expression of God. In the eternity that is without end, by the divine, eternal, and surpassingly glorious life, they will live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy. ",
  "9336":"\"Come!\" is the response of the Spirit and the bride to the Lord's word in v. 16 and to His repeated warning in vv. 7 and 12. It expresses the desire for the Lord's coming. Whoever hears this response also should say, \"Come!\" thus expressing a joint desire for the Lord's coming. All believers who love the Lord's appearing (2 Tim. 4:8) should express such a joint desire. ",
  "9337":"The Spirit and the bride, on one hand, desire that the Lord will come, and, on the other hand, yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction. When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's coming, we also have an earnest concern for the sinner's salvation. ",
  "9338":"See note 14. ",
  "9339":"The \"I\" here should be the Lord Jesus, in accordance with vv. 16 and 20; it may, however, refer to John, in accordance with 1:2. In any case, John was one in spirit with the Lord in this solemn warning. ",
  "9340":"The main items of the plagues unveiled in this book are the three woes of the great tribulation, and the second death, that is, the perishing of the whole man &#151; spirit, soul, and body &#151; in the lake of fire. The outstanding features of the blessing revealed in this book are the tree of life and the holy city. Whether one will suffer the plagues or share in the blessing depends on how one deals with the prophecy of this book. We should not add to the prophecy, nor should we take away anything from it. We must receive it as it is written. ",
  "9341":"See note 18. ",
  "9342":"This is the third time in this chapter that the Lord warns us that He is coming quickly. ",
  "9343":"This is the apostle John's prayer and his response to the Lord's warning. It is also the last prayer in the Bible. After hearing this book, we should all pray such a prayer and have such a response &#151; \"Come, Lord Jesus!\" The entire Bible concludes with the desire for the Lord's coming expressed as a prayer. ",
  "9344":"After seeing all the visions and hearing all the prophecies in this book, we still need the Lord's grace. Only the grace of the Lord Jesus can enable us to live and walk according to these visions and prophecies. Not only this book but also the entire Bible closes with this grace, the grace that enables us to experience the all-inclusive Christ and participate in the Triune God that we may become His eternal corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, that He and we may enjoy absolute satisfaction and complete rest mutually for eternity. ",
  "9345":"Some ancient authorities add, Christ. ",
  "9346":"Some ancient authorities omit, the saints. Amen. <br><br>   The New Jerusalem, the last major item revealed in this book, is not only the conclusion of the entire Bible but also the ultimate consummation of all the important items revealed in the Bible. The Triune God, the Triune God's economy, Christ's redemption, God's salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom are all consummated in the New Jerusalem as the consummating item. Thus, to say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city is not logical; it does not correspond with this book's principle of using signs for the revelation of the mysterious things. According to the entire revelation of the complete Bible, the New Jerusalem, the conclusion of the complete Bible, is a divine mingling of the processed Triune God with the redeemed and transformed tripartite man, a mingling of divinity with humanity, issuing in a universal, corporate, mysterious person. This person is: <br><br>   (1) The wife of the Lamb (21:9); <br><br>   (2) The ultimate consummation of God's tabernacle and temple, as the eternal mutual habitation of both God and man (21:3, 22); <br><br>   (3) The ultimate consummation of God's work of the new creation in the old creation throughout the generations (Acts 4:11; John 2:19; Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 3:9-12; 1 Pet. 2:4-5); and <br><br>   (4) The ultimate consummation of God's eternal economy and God's divine accomplishments."
